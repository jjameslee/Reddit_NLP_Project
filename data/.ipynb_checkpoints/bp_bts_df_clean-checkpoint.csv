"This is something I can get behind and appreciate. Seeing BLACKPINK expand their sound and experiment with their music color and genres is something that I've wanted to see in anticipation of their future music. I'm glad they didn't decide to play it safe and go for a similar sound to their 'SQUARE UP' album and more EDM focused house style from their SQUARE sound. This is at least for me. I primarily listen to purely Hip-Hop/RnB/Neo-Soul. BLACKPINK and BIGBANG are groups that I listen to outside of my lane. What they do with their sound makes it easier to digest different genres of music for me because of their hip-hop, trap influences. At the same time, they're the only groups where I'm willing to open myself up to different genres of music because of the quality of the music. I wouldn't even think about K-Pop if I were to listen to it for the sole purpose of listening to a single genre of music. Whether the reception is poor or not (which I highly doubt it'll be poor), I'm going to enjoy this experimentation to its fullest. ",1,1043,188
Hold the fuck up?! Rock songs? I'm considering skipping class tomorrow now.,1,75,12
What time and date is this in PDT? 0 AM is a bit confusing as I don't know if it's April 4 or 5 in KST lol,1,106,27
Is there a list? Last year I remember they streamed all the acts the first weekend. ,1,84,16
"As a blink I'll wait till mv dropped. Then I'll stream it on all my devices. Full album I can check at any time, but help to others 1 time in a year.",1,149,33
Pretty much. Just refresh the page and it should be there,1,57,11
"You can expect some of them to have a more mellowed out Rock that leans more towards RnB. There are a ton of ways to do rock. Nonetheless, I'm very excited for the release. ",1,173,34
\[SELLING\] (2) Blackpink Tickets @ Allstate Arena in Chicago 04/24 &amp;#x200B; GA Floor w/ Soundcheck \~ selling for face value &amp;#x200B; DM for details :) ,1,161,25
Almost all of them are rock songs? I was thinking maybe one of them would be a ‚ÄòStay‚Äô type of song.,1,99,21
"If Ros√© actually comes out with a guitar for these ""rock songs"" then i am done, i am telling you that. PLS YG :D Super excited for it, i won't be surprised if this EP will contain their best song yet, and that would be quite the feat tbh",1,237,49
Dead. Track 1 is Rock/Hiphop Track 2 is Dance/Rock Track 3 is Rock/Hiphop Track 4 is Rock Ttack 5 is Hiphop According to weibo,1,126,24
i meant why is there no livestream for them,1,43,9
Well i probably won't wait either! But i also will buy the album so it's fine imo to listen to it before it officially releases on spotify,1,138,27
"I was planning on justifying it by buying the album either physically if we ever get one, or digitally if we don't. But I like your idea better. Thank's for the tip!",1,165,32
"Can you imagine? Legs for years, decades, centuries!",1,52,8
For square up I used a vpn to make an Asia-based Spotify account; works fine and supports BP instead of random uploaders :),1,123,23
"The album won't drop for me until 13 hours after the MV release! No way I will be able to wait that long. I'm starting to like this staggered release less and less, but hopefully it helps the numbers. Blackpink to the top baby let's go",1,235,46
I don't think you can speed up the video to trick the YouTube algorithms. Here's a [guide](  a fansite made on how to stream properly.,1,134,25
I am definitely going to wait for the vlive and mv release before i listen to any new song. After that i am not sure yet if i can wait another 7 hours until i listen to the other songs or if i will try and find them on youtube for example. (cest) Probably the latter :D ,1,270,57
"Uhm, I believe Youtube doesn't count views if you put a video on loop, specifically for that reason. You'd have to click replay every time for it to count, but I also heard Youtube counts a view after like 30 seconds of watching a video. Please correct me if I'm wrong tho.",1,273,52
it just boils down to lack of information from official sources. *insert classic YG meme about how awful he is at handling this stuff* but I guess at this point all we can do is wait and see what happens,1,203,40
Here's what's happening according to [Variety]( ,1,48,6
I‚Äôve never bought an album at release. What do I do at 12 AM EST? Just go to iTunes and spam refresh?,1,101,22
Where did Ros√©‚Äôs knees go? :(,1,29,6
"To me, it‚Äôs confusing because the US doesn‚Äôt have a standard time. There are 4 different ‚Äústandard‚Äù times. It is very unlikely that it would release that way but there hasn‚Äôt been any clarification. All we have is KST, then release within each time zone. It makes sense to me that it would release at EST, trust me, I‚Äôm not fighting you. I‚Äôm just saying that the statement is confusing. I‚Äôve never encountered a release like this. ",1,431,77
I think youtube consider it as a spam when u loop a certain video. Better to clear your browsing data when streaming,1,116,22
11AM Tomorrow,1,13,2
"1st week livestreamed, 2nd week curated material.",1,49,7
"The tweet (after translation, so maybe room for error there) says ""However for overseas markets, digital tracks will be released at each country‚Äôs standard time. (4/5 0AM)"" Based on that and how every other music release at least in the US has always been, it's very unlikely it will release for each time zone within the same country.",1,335,58
"The reddit post I commented makes it sound like each individual time zone, same with the Twitter comments. I thought it was weird too, there‚Äôs definitely some confusion but the way you are saying makes more sense. But there has been no official response about this. ",1,266,46
"I think there is some confusion on what ‚Äúeach respective time zone‚Äù means then. Normal you see a music release say ‚Äú12 est‚Äù but in this case it doesn‚Äôt say anything. Most of Twitter is saying that it‚Äôs 12am in EACH time zone, which I thought was weird too. But there has been no official response about release times. ",1,318,59
Wow I just came back from a similar post in the Kpop reddit and people were just plain negative over there about this teaser but everyone here is all happy. The contrast is unreal,1,179,34
"only for the MV though. the album comes out at 12am in the timezones for each country. so for example, in the US it's out at 12am EST. that's for all of the US, not just the east coast. So for CST it would be 11pm on 4/4",1,220,48
"that's always how music in the US works. it is based on EST. they don't base it on individual time zones within the country. for the US it's always just 12am EST. so 11pm CST, and so on.",1,186,38
"i‚Äôve never seen a music release in multiple time zones across the same country. music services serve the entire country not individual time zones. plus it says each countries respective time zone. so the first time zone to hit midnight in each country. so 12am est, 11pm cst, 9pm pst. at least that‚Äôs how i see it.",1,314,57
Wait so their performance won't be lived streamed until second week?,1,68,11
Now just wait for countdown ,1,28,5
Right click the video. There is an option for loop.,1,51,10
Could also mean Day Minus 1,1,27,6
So we can watch BP live,1,23,6
why though..,1,12,2
"Ego makes more sense than what I read, which was Egg üòÇ",1,54,12
"How do you loop on youtube? Also does it count for multiple devices? Like if I use my PC, my laptop, and my tablet does that count as three? Or would I need different accounts? ",1,177,35
BP *currently* isn't in the list for Live Stream Artists . . . hope that changes.,1,81,16
Hell ya hell ya hella ya,1,24,6
"That doesn‚Äôt make sense that the album would drop at 11 pm CST. It would come out at 12 CST. Unless they are releasing in the states based off of one time zone (est or pst), then that‚Äôs when your comment would make sense. According to this post, it‚Äôs 12 am in each time zone  ",1,276,55
i'm really going to love this comeback huh &amp;#x200B; i love their looks so much. if fits them well. ,1,103,19
"Album will release at midnight in each respective time zone. So midnight for me MST, midnight for you CST. So on... MV is the one that‚Äôs being released everywhere midnight KST. So for me, MV will release 4/4 at 9am. ",1,216,40
i wish hahaha,1,13,3
11pm tomorrow night,1,19,3
It's Korea time which would be about 10am in Central time I believe ,1,68,13
*zooms into picture of organ*,1,29,5
Thank you for that. ,1,20,4
Same. Can't wait! ,1,18,3
Countdown link:  ,1,17,2
Btw there's a countdown option below,1,36,6
"If I guess an announcement about the physical EP will come tomorrow, it could be a nice teaser before the M/V drop and probably a good way to keep that stock price stable. Like you say though the most important thing is that we are getting new music, I'm so hyped. ",1,265,51
"Speaking of military, D-1 could also refer to the French Char D-1 light tank.",1,77,14
"for some reason, as a huge jisoo stan and even bigger BP stan, the new song didn‚Äôt surprise me as much as dddd... The Lets kill this love part seems weirdly high pitched and girl for the girl crush concept judging from the teaser, and it seems like they will reuse a gun choreo but change to a massive machine gun or something this time. hope to be pleasantly surprised though :) ",1,380,72
"Memes are not allowed anymore, for the second time. Go to  or post them on the weekly discussion thread.",1,104,19
"Could you tell me what is the live counter? I am interested in YouTube algorithms, but don't quite understand it yet. ",1,118,21
I don‚Äôt get why they push Jenny so much (especially in the international market). Obviously Lisa is the GOAT of Blackpink and Jisoo is the prettiest and best girl goes to Rose. ,1,177,32
My first BlackPink comeback. Only one day left. Yes!!!!,1,55,9
Lol.. I translated the song introductions and posted them in the chatroom... But it is still unconfirmed info so maybe it is wrong too,1,134,24
"Youtube only deletes views from the live counter which are not quality views, that is also the reason they freeze views. Any legit view will count, there is no trolling, this is their way to make sure that they can make money, to be able to give quality control to the companies which buy ad space.",1,298,56
Yeah I believe this is from weibo as the song genres are already out for each track  ,1,85,17
"Since my dumbass cannot wrap my head around time zones, can someone tell me when this comeback comes out in CDT?",1,112,21
Yeah &gt;!700!&lt; is great tbf polling data for elections only generally uses &gt;!around 1000!&lt; (at least in the UK),1,121,19
*praying to the Kpop gods as we speak*,1,38,8
"Yeah i absolutely feel you there, don't lose hope just yet! ESPECIALLY WITH THIS AMAZING CONCEPT :O",1,99,17
"I think it drops at 4PM, with the countdown live beginning at 3PM. God bless these EU friendly times, thank god they didn't do it at 6PM in Korea.",1,146,29
I had the same question. Thanks for asking lol ,1,47,9
"&gt;Either way though, imo most important is the fact we get new music anyway! True true, i'm just a bit sad that there hasn't been any notice yet..i want my Blackpink album/photocard collection to grow! &gt;.&lt;",1,213,36
"Is this video filmed for C-blinks? As Jennie said ""thank you"" in Mandarin at the end",1,84,16
Yes!! Thank you! ü•∞,1,18,4
There was a thread about this yesterday:   Have fun at the concert! ,1,68,12
Jisoo is killing it with that pose,1,34,7
24 hrs to go omg im so hyped ,1,29,8
The visual assault continues. As always the pinks looking fiiine. Can‚Äôt believe in less than 23 hours we‚Äôll officially have 13 songs y‚Äôall. üò≠,1,141,24
"Well seems there is an album as the members themselves have just said it themselves, so I guess later this week or next week.  ",1,127,24
It‚Äôs happening...,1,17,2
What time does it drop at GMT?,1,30,7
"Well i just don't think it would make any sense all things considered. Didn't jennie say in an interview that they shot for the album pics? Also the digital copy people get in the US for concert tickets, i think that would have been phrased differently. Then i think i saw some article which said there will be 2 versions. Just overall it would be so weird to not have a physical release when square up did so well, i just cannot see it. Now i cannot tell you why there wouldn't be any news of it yet though, with preorders, etc. That is a big mystery to me as well and it certainly points towards no physical release, i will give you that 100%. If they don't address this tomorrow then i'll be on your side as well though^^ Either way though, imo most important is the fact we get new music anyway!",1,799,154
"This should have a Game of Thrones tie in. I mean, it has trumpets, a Queen, and slaying. Pretty much Game of Thrones. Haha",1,123,24
The unnis in heels the maknaes in flats haha. Btw is Miss Roseanne Park wearing cowboy boots with a crown? Queen!,1,113,21
Is there a way to tranfer your positivity to me? haha ,1,54,11
Not exactly in weho. Near the Beverly center on 3rd Street. Technically LA. I don't want to give out the exact location until I ask and get an ok.,1,146,29
"I wouldn't be surprised if we get some details on physical release tomorrow, for a release next Friday. Have faith I believe we will be getting one. ",1,149,27
"No it actually drops in 23 hours. That is why they posted this as well d-1, one day left :D ",1,92,20
"I very much doubt that there won't be any tbh, it is definitely weird that there are no news at all yet though. I'd hope to get some info regarding that tomorrow during the vlive, or maybe even a teaser in like 8 hours, we'll see!",1,230,46
"It is a military term initially, d-day 8day of the attack). D-x where x is the amount of days till d-day.",1,105,21
They keep it spaced out so that all comebacks feel like a first for us. YG really cares about the fans!,1,103,21
2 DAYS TO GO!!!,1,15,4
Work: what's wrong? Me: 4 girls ded me,1,38,8
So excited !,1,12,3
I was going to ask the same thing. I've seen that sort of thing before and wondered what the reference was. ,1,108,21
Wow I think that already makes up a reliable pooled data (?),1,60,12
"It's tomorrow in the West, right?",1,33,6
"I‚Äôm so excited! I‚Äôm literally going to be watching the music video until the album drops for me. Also, it just hit me that I‚Äôll be seeing this song live only like a week and a half later. What is life.",1,201,41
I long for the days when they'll give killer heels for ChaeLisa too.,1,68,13

Pretty hyped but at the same time i was really REALLY hoping to get some physical album details now but no...sadly there goes all my hopes for a physical album :/ i'm pretty sad tbh,1,181,35
"Yup. I'm gonna love this. These friggin outfits are killing me. I think they're more personalized, and therefore better than D4. I feel like they're sorta keeping the regal-vibe of D4, but personalizing it like in Whistle. ",1,223,37
"Screw my wig and scalp, save my soul!",1,37,8
"Omg,Rose with the crown? Queen Rosie ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,39,7
So it was a dumb question. Thanks for clarifying XD,1,51,10
"Love this. We get to have queen Ros√®, baby punk Jennie, goth Jisoo, and futuristic Lisa. Man I am so ready for this EP to drop tomorrow! It‚Äôs gunna be insane. ",1,159,31
It's a countdown. 1 day left,1,28,6
Can't wait to witness my first BP comeback!,1,43,8
What exactly does D-1 mean sorry if that‚Äôs a stupid question ,1,61,11
And gunning down the haters at the end,1,38,8

WE GOT ONE,1,10,3
Ur right it won't matter in a teaser üôà but in the full version if it's still in D minor I'll have to pitch 4d down a semitone ,1,126,28
This will be great for her career advancement üòÇ,1,47,9
Woah nice compilation u/bk1155 ,1,31,4
i think maybe just increase the pitch of the 4D parts to regular and it would be fine,1,85,18
I think I need an ambulance ;-;,1,31,7
IM NOT READY I SWEAR,1,20,5
"Honestly another unnamed sub think MVS are shot over 3 weeks or something and never close to the comeback date.. and they also think YG hires non professionals who would struggle to put together a MV.. seriously so toxic over there, it's K-pop industry, it's obvious they will have top producers for their MVs.",1,310,54
"I bet this song will be somewhat like DDDD with ""soft"" and ""mean"" parts, black and pink.",1,88,17
See u later was already my favorite breakup song of 2018 lol. The lyrics are just so savage,1,91,18
"People hating YG I understand completely, but I don't understand the constant hate towards BP. It's true that they're not the most talented stars in the industry currently, but does that mean that everyone who is not the best at singing/dancing/rapping deserves getting hate? ",1,276,44

"Anyone notice what's written on the license plate of the car? I read ""Ego"".",1,75,14

"You have to understand that the main 3 big labels are Warner, Universal and Sony. They have a bunch of sub labels that they own.

That‚Äôs about it. Anyone can work with anyone they want. But yeah it could also mean nothing as the other commenter said because they may just like the group.",1,463,88
MV production reminds me of bigbang MV somewhat,1,47,8
so pumped now for their performance there its gonna be so epic ,1,63,12

"Hi Everyone, I got the blessing of the mods to post this, so hopefully we have a solid response. I shortly after tickets for the LA concert were available whether people wanted to meet up.

This is a short questionnaire to see where people stand in the meetup. Feel free to ask questions. I hope to meet many of you soon.",1,474,89

"GOD DAMN!!! I had my expectations high but so far holy shit... LISA... All the girls looking expensive and badass in this. As people are saying I'm loving the militant sound they got going, with the Blackpink revolution salute and everything. But the MV production looks AWESOME.... people in another unnamed sub were saying it would rushed and all that but so far it's looking great to me",1,389,68
"I just know that they'll yell a ""BLACKPINK is the revolution.""",1,62,11
That's like the hardest thing I've ever heard...and that's just a teaser.,1,73,12

"Goooosebumps! I AM SO EXCITED I‚ÄôM BARELY FUNCTIONING THROUGH THIS WEEK. (That said tho, I‚Äôll always be on the fence about trumpets in songs cause they can be a little cheesy, especially with a drum/trumpet combo military sound - BUT I know I‚Äôm going to love it anyway cause I‚Äôm biased I just love everything they do, and we haven‚Äôt even heard the full thing yet so I can‚Äôt even judge it yet.)",1,392,73
"I had my expectations set high but this still blew me away. The set and outfits look amazing, the beat is great and assuming that part is the chorus, it sounds like it's gonna be extremely catchy.",1,196,37
All of them can kill me and I wouldn‚Äôt even mind,1,48,11
I wasn't sure about the trumpets on first listen through... Then I watched it again! &lt;3333333,1,96,16
"Also guys, did you see Ros√© with that ponytail and her move?? Already iconic i am telling ya :D",1,95,19
Now that's a teaser! ,1,21,4
"To be honest, after seeing the individual trailers I was very discouraged. I was disappointed by the paper-taped-to-a-wall moment and basically a video of them standing there looking at the camera. But this... this is greatness",1,227,36
"I really like the use of the trumpets and the outfits are killer, but this sound bit sounds a little forced and so far IDK how I feel about the beat. Now I really want to see the song + MV.",1,189,41

Better promotion than yg lol,1,28,5
any blinks from hawaii want to shallow in pain with me,1,54,11
I'd love to see them on the Voice - big stage and huge primetime network audience. What I noticed about their appearances on Colbert and GMA is that smaller stages didn't suit them well; they're awkward to dance around. Hope they do Kimmel (big outdoor stage) around Coachella and SNL (only for the prestige) when tour comes to New Jersey.,1,339,60
YGE teasers - Black Woori Bank - Pink,1,37,8
"That's kinda surprising, considering that albums usually drop at whatever time when it's 0AM KST. It's the first time I see stuff like this tbh",1,143,25
I'd imagine there will be a lot of copyright takedown notices by UMG on YouTube. ,1,81,15
100% there will be a physical release but the date is still unknown. ,1,69,13
They want a full week of tracking on charts like Billboard hence the staggered digital release. ,1,96,16
it‚Äôll probably be released across the USA at the same time like any normal release. so midnight EST!,1,100,18
Dont you ever get tired of sucking yg off,1,41,9
"Mmm that's disappointing but still better than not getting the album until 5 a.m. EST (6 p.m. KST). I'd always rather stay up late over getting up early! And at least everyone gets the title song sooner (via the MV)! That's what I'm most excited for, so it'll hold me over until the full release!",1,296,55

I must also resist playing the mini album sampler.,1,50,9
omg this makes my heart so happyyyy,1,35,7
"How true it is I don't know but @BLACKPINK\_Bar (the Chinese fan base twitter page) are saying that there will be a physical album, apparently they have spoken to somebody (they refer to this person as album agent) as they are supposed to be selling copies to Chinese fans I imagine they have. People on the the page seem to trust them so who knows. I would imagine we will hear something tomorrow if its happening.",1,415,76
"Stream the Mv all day at work lmao. Try to contain myself and not listen to the album until it‚Äôs officially released in the states. It‚Äôs going to take a lot of self control and I‚Äôm already using that to eat healthy so, we will see how that goes lmao ",1,250,50
I wish I could watch it with people who also like K-pop but my uni doesn't have a K-pop soc,1,91,20
I hope so too. YG surely wont drop the teaser on Thursday since that's technically the same day as the M/V. Getting real exciting now. ,1,135,25

"*And so the hype begins . . .* My guess is that we'll see more possible colabs, upcoming US TV show appearances (I'm hoping for the **The Voice** and **SNL**), etc, etc. And then when they hit Coachella &amp; Dua Lipa joins them on stage (just wishing, no inside info) . . . Gonna be a ride! God Bless Interscope",1,312,60
Does anyone know if we‚Äôre going to get a physical release?,1,58,11
No joke... They‚Äôre 19 hours ahead of us üò≠ I guess I‚Äôll just stream the MV at work. ,1,83,18

but do they have fast internet connection?,1,42,7
"These music labels are HUGE. UMG has literally HUNDREDS of artists and groups vs K-Pop where there's maybe like, 10 under a label at most. I guarantee you they have no idea who and who isn't with their label unless it's explicitly stated. There is no label allegiance as they literally cannot keep track (neither can I! I need to google who's with who!) Halsey is EMI/UMG who just likes them Dua Lip is Warner, who likes them and did a collab DJ Snake is Interscope, but he just likes them We can't always assume it's a collab. ",1,528,98
"I already liked woori bank, but now i LOVE woori bank ",1,54,11

"She‚Äôs coming for us this comeback, I‚Äôm ready to listen to her heavenly vocals while she kills me ",1,97,18
No not at all. Just make a vlive account and that's all you need.,1,65,14
How are k-Blinks taking the news that the girls will have less than a week of promotions before the America tour? Will they be doing full Korean promos like music shows and radio programs for the few days they are still in Korea? I don't want them to be exhausted when I see them week 1 Coachella ,1,297,57

well okay :),1,12,3
"Yeah that is exactly what i expected, was really the only way UMG's request made any sense.",1,91,17
"just take a snap, what are they going to do anyways? lol ",1,57,12
I'm sorry in getting flashbacks of DJ Snake üòÇüòÇüòÇ We can't always assume if some western artist likes BP they want a collab,1,121,23
"Kiwi blinks, you‚Äôll be the first to hear the album!",1,51,10
International Queens ,1,21,2
I used to live near La Cienega (by Melrose). The Beverly Center is a very popular shopping spot in West Hollywood. This is almost the same as having a huge billboard in Times Square.,1,182,34
but i think they are interested in a collaboration,1,50,9
Yeah but label allegiance isnt that important over here,1,55,9
Damn I would be so excited if I saw that,1,40,10
"3 more weeks until the US tour begins and about a week and a half until Coachella! I honestly can't wait to see our girls on stage and to get the album via email. Also, when are we getting album info, we've gotten nothing!",1,222,44

"Probably just gonna watch the countdown vlive, then the mv a ton, listening to the other songs, post a bunch on this sub because i think a lot of people will share their excitement and that's awesome, watch the mv a bunch more. I don't particularly care about the youtube records in itself, but i would be lying if i said i wouldn't follow it still, it's just such a good measurement of their growth. ",1,401,75
"I agree, she looks. . . different. I didn't recognize her at first glance. I don't know what's off. . . but she looks a little different",1,136,27
Do you have to pay to watch the vlive?,1,38,9
"Super excited for this, this countdown vlive was a highlight last year! IIRC it didn't get uploaded to their channel after the fact, which it typically should but idk. Just letting some of you know :P ",1,201,36

If these are new outfits then these are my favorite ones so far ,1,64,13
what a great time for BLINKS,1,28,6
Is it korean time or which time zone?,1,37,8
The girls sometimes talks in korean mostly but they also do talks in english as they are quite aware the huge international fans that they have.,1,144,26
There's a translator on hand that does the subs live. The BP VLive channel doesn't keep countdown streams so if you miss it then it'll be hard to watch it again. I can't even find their Square Up countdowns on YouTube except for small clips.,1,241,45
"V LIVE‚Äôs like this usually have ""live subs"". Someone translates while it‚Äôs live, but the subs are a little bit delayed because it‚Äôs live.",1,137,24
Their vlive countdown is 10 am for me when I‚Äôm at work. I would actually would have preferred to stay up late so I can stream in peace. üò≠üòÇ,1,138,29
"I won‚Äôt be able to watch the countdown, I‚Äôm at work. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong I remember the Square Up Vlive countdown didn‚Äôt have a replay.",1,139,27
Wow. Ros√© looks amazing in this. The shaking camera and close-ups has me creeped out and the teaser music is so eerie it complements the music video really well. This has me pretty excited for the MV that's going to drop on Friday.,1,231,43
Bigbang was mentioned in 2016 on the highest paid musicians list.,1,65,11
Those are all resale tickets. They won‚Äôt cancel a show that‚Äôs been sold. ,1,73,13

"It‚Äôs not, don‚Äôt worry! It doesn‚Äôt have subs when it‚Äôs live, it usually takes a couple of hours to a few days before it gets subbed. ",1,132,26
Does it have subs when it's live? I know this is a stupid question lol. ,1,72,15
DDDD comeback I just stay up all night and watch the M/V on loop and watch my twitter feed go crazy.,1,100,21
"Skip school, wake up to watch vlive and then whole day stream song",1,66,13
BTS was on last year but yes they are the first GG ever to be on the list. Kings of Queens of Kpop!,1,99,23
Will it be in Korean of English?,1,32,7
When the release used to be 6pm KST I would pull allnighters watching all their old mvs and catching their VLive.. It was enough excitement to keep me up all night üòÑ this time around though I'll be in mid lecture when their mv drops,1,232,45
2am I gotta stay up loool,1,25,6
"It will legit get released in time for me to listen to it on loop on the bus like fifty million times but other than that I think I am more excited before it gets released then there is like a week or two of hype after, and thats it, and I only watch it by myself, then send it to my other friends then we just talk about it later.",1,331,71
Wow they are on Forbes! Is BP the first Kpop group or girl group being mentioned by Forbes?,1,91,18
"Yeah, especially Jisoo and Rosie‚Äôs outfits (I can barely see Jennie and Lisa‚Äôs outfits). Are they really? I haven‚Äôt heard that. ",1,128,21
But the whole deadly murderous vibe of the other outfits doesnt match with these. They also making another MV for 'don't know what to do' right? ,1,145,26
I actually thought this picture was from their AIIYL era lol but I think it‚Äôs another set of new outfit for KTL. ,1,113,22
Woah is this another set of new outfit for the ktl song or this is an old picture?,1,82,18
I think this angle just makes her face look rounder than it is,1,62,13
Wow they are having new outfits for different teasers! ,1,55,9
Her right ear got chopped off? Are you high do you know how perspective works?,1,78,15
Thursday/Friday will be a long day for our girls. We all know how early inkygayo prep starts.,1,93,17

"Again, I don‚Äôt know if there will be any changes in NA(since they will have 4 new songs by then), but I think ‚Äúmost of their songs are performed in main stage‚Äù is wrong description. (I Feel like Stage B has more, or at least 50/50)",1,231,46
It's either a sub unit (which probably will be the baddest subunit of all time) with a collab with Pharrell or Lisa just accompanied Jennie that time. ,1,151,27
"That's what I was thinking. Like if they perform in Stage B, they'll be a lot closer to me. But base on what i heard, main stage is ideal because most of their songs are performed in the main stage.",1,198,40
"Highly recommend Stage B. I don‚Äôt know how it would be in LA (there may have some different between Asia leg and NA leg), but in my experience, if your position is good enough, when the girls went to stage B, you will feel like they just stand in front of you.

Shooketh shooketh shooketh. Park Chaeyoung let me talk to you,1,61,10
I think they made it 0 pm simply because it will be morning in the West coast of USA. If it was like 6 pm korean time this would mean it the release will be around 11 pm - 4am for Americans and not many people will be up at that time. You can check out one post above for the exact time that the comeback will released in your place. ,1,334,71

I'm sure they've already taken all of this into consideration. Look at all of the hit artists UMG/Interscope has produced. I trust their judgment on this. At the end of the day they're going to do what's best for business.

"And other artists put out one album in 3 years with like 12 songs. Now you have a fair point to say that kpop in general has a different strategy, with way more content. But you cannot just say that everyone has to follow that style either. In my experience the more songs you put out in a specific timeframe, the more likely it is that people won't care about most of these songs. Releasing a lot will lead to people having different favorites though, but in general i think most people will listen to the full album a few times and then pick their favorites and never listen to the ""filler"" ever again. How many of these 27 songs do you really cherish? Now i am not gonna sit here and pretend that everything YG has done so far in the contex of musical content is fine, 2017 was a disgrace with only having one song. But people shouldn't focus on the past so much, last year we got 4 original blackpink songs, 1 collaboration and 1 solo. For this year the plan is to get another EP out later and possibly all 3 other solos. That would make it 4 + 3 + 4 (worst case for the 2nd EP) songs, and i wouldn't be surprised to get another collaboration as well. Now one can be careful and say that the other stuff is only planned so far, totally agree! But looking at the financial report of YGE it seems fair to hope for the 2nd EP, it seem to be their strategy going forward. Point is: Things are only getting better, it seems so weird to complain about it when it is the best time to be a blackpink fan yet.",1,1504,294

Yes Lisa kill it!,1,17,4
"&gt; Does this seriously make you any LESS of a fan? Because I don‚Äôt see how and why it would. If you take a step back and look at what they‚Äôve accomplished, there‚Äôs a method to the madness indeed. And it‚Äôs working People really don't like to hear this but it is simply the truth. Blackpink is basically the biggest korean girlgroup right now, arguably the 2nd biggest kpop group period. Totally agree with you, it seems to be working! 2017 was the real problem for their overall song catalog, that was the year we only got one song. Now people expect them to make up for it i guess, but it seems like YG actually wants them to have 2 CBs per year from now on if one looks at the financial report which was released recently. That would make it 4 songs in 2016, 1 song in 2017, 4 songs in 2018 (5 with the solo, 6 with the collab) and so far 4 in 2019 (with potential 3 solos and another ep). So it is only getting better and better, i would wish people to see that. ",1,967,190

"I recommend ‚ÄúMad World‚Äù, ""Trivisa"", ""Ten Years"", ""Men On The Dragon"", ""Tracey"" and ""Project Gutenberg"", though there are many colloquial elements in these movies, they are generally quite good. In fact, many good productions had released in the past few years.",1,260,41
Lisoo's telling us to BUCKLE UP im so hyped lmaoo,1,49,10
haha very true lol,1,18,4
"I love how eerie it sounds. Very disturbing, but i like it. lol",1,63,13
"Same!! I have a 7:30 am lecture, and a quiz for that lecture too.. Sucks.",1,73,15
"My babies! The comeback is getting closer and closer. UMG making YGE change their plans, i stan. They deserve the WORLD, and they will have it. #queens",1,151,27
"I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see them speaking even more English this time around since they‚Äôre marketing more globally now (and as somebody who doesn‚Äôt understand Korean, I‚Äôm thankful lol. Also just as a fellow Aussie who loves hearing Rosie speak, I‚Äôm excited!).",1,262,43
Lisa would love this!,1,21,4
BlackPink going for that Grime/Garage genre!,1,44,6
Idk man. Its thermodynamics.,1,28,4
"Creepy, eerie and unsettling, I like it! Definitely seeing Lisa in my nightmares and looking forward to it. I did not kill this love, I did not. Oh hi, Lisa. ",1,158,30
This is more important. Skip the lecture üòÇüòÇ,1,43,8
Thanks üôè Can‚Äôt wait to see them!,1,32,7
If I remembered correctly from the DDDD countdown there were english subtitles but not for every single sentence. Good enough to understand what they're saying though. Jennie and Rose also occasionally spoke English to cater to international fans as well. Sooooooooo hyped for this comeback ‚ù§Ô∏è,1,293,46
Even if she does i probably die the moment she said yes.,1,56,12
Just the exactly time the new songs comes out.üò¢ But you can watch replay later.ü§ó,1,80,15
teasers are always misleading,1,29,4
"Well, I think it's safe to say *none* of us were expecting this sound! =O",1,73,15
"Idk why you're being downvoted, its a simple question!",1,54,9
Jisoo yeah. Her 4D personality is so adorable. She's the oldest and prettiest in the group and yet she acts the most immature. ,1,127,23
Can‚Äôt wait!,1,11,2
"Actually It‚Äôs my first too, but I‚Äôve watched almost every video on their free V Live channelüòÇ",1,93,17
Dude this is tragic. I have an 8am lecture on the 4th.,1,54,12
"Is there any Eng sub during the live? I‚Äôve watched replays of previous COUNTDOWN LIVE, and they were already got subtitles. Hope this time they will use more English.",1,166,29
I understand. But for us its 2200 hehe,1,38,8
"Lisa - every time I watch ‚ÄòAs if it‚Äôs your last‚Äô and she shows up with that candy floss, my day becomes infinitely better.",1,122,24
Thanks. This is my first comeback. I'm excited and have so many questions lol ,1,78,14
You can watch it directly üòÑ,1,27,6
Do you know if we have to be subbed to watch the stream? ,1,57,13
Yes... it took me a long long time to calculate it...üòÇ,1,54,11

So April 4th 7am (pst) for US audiences? Lol ,1,45,9
Lalisa Manoban let me talk to you. ,1,35,7
"Last countdown VLive for Square Up had almost 1 million viewers, can't imagine what it will be this time around.",1,112,20
You saved my assüòÇ Sorry for the typo.,1,37,8
Directed by David Lynch,1,23,4
So that's April 3rd at 7am (pst) for the US audience right? I'm not great with time changes. ,1,93,18
"Considering local time, I thought they might cancel it.",1,55,9
That's a comeback routine for them I think?,1,43,8
"Jisoo is and will forever be my ultimate bias. She's perfect, her voice is fantastic, she's beautiful and she care for us Blinks. Plus she's Jisoo and she's ok. Ros√© is my second favorite for similar reasons. Jennie and Lisa are also fantastic but I can choose between them",1,273,49
I- &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; did they intend for it to be this eerie?,1,69,12
Blackpink x Meshuggah when?,1,27,4
this is TOO GOOD,1,16,4
Idk why but it feels like a horror movie,1,40,9
"I'm scared, but very excited",1,28,5
Yeh cmon it's a good meme ,1,26,6
Depression hitting.,1,19,2
Oooooooh this sounds good!,1,26,4

i was thinking each day until release ,1,38,7
Can I say that I do not have a favourite member? As I love all four members equally.,1,84,18
We might get a new member video teaser every couple of hours?,1,61,12
Gotta beat bots for that karma üòÇ,1,32,7
I'm confused. Am I dead? ,1,25,5
It‚Äôs 9 am Thursday Colorado time (MST) This is the best news ,1,61,12
FKDNSNSNSKKSKSKS IDK WHY THIS COMMENT REMINDED ME OF STRANGER THINGS OMFGGG,1,75,11
This is so creepy. I love it.,1,29,7
who doesnt haha ,1,16,3
Ohhh myyy godddd. Love this murder vibe so much. üò≠üò≠üò≠ I‚Äôm so fucking excited. But usually how close to the actual song are the samples in these teasers?,1,151,28
I WAS CONFUSED WHEN LISA WAS UPSIDE DOWN I THOUGHT THEY WERE LEGS,1,65,13
"AHS: Blackpink This took me there, wow!",1,39,7
"I'm getting a creepy/dark vibe, I LIKE IT.",1,42,8
lisa giving me american horror story vibes and i am NOT complaining. ,1,69,12
Wow creepy but attractive!,1,26,4
The video teasers are always the killers for me. I go into comebacks as clean as I possibly can. I want to click but must resist!,1,129,26
I'm trying to fall asleep for work tomorrow and this came out! It kinda spooked me a little but in a good way. So ready.,1,120,25
this is out of nowhere wtf this is not good and my bias too wth,1,63,15
OH MY GOD,1,9,3
ment to put 033119 omg sorry i panicked ,1,40,8
What WTF,1,8,2
It‚Äôs really eerie! I‚Äôm super into it! ,1,38,7
"Hey, hey. Take it easy. You're starting to cut deep.",1,52,10
That would be like 9pm est?,1,27,6
If Nini doesn't have those bangs in the Kill this Love MV I'm gonna riot ;-;,1,76,16
Tbh it‚Äôs pretty catchy lmao,1,27,5
"Lisa is my favourite member because she is so sweet, is a language kween and has a dance ability that one day I wish to achieve.",1,128,26
Crap memes be like...,1,21,4
why is iz*one in this though,1,28,6
whoever made that yhs banner is evil . . im crying lol ,1,55,12
"Reported for harassment. I don't need this kind of negativity in my life. Thanks, I hate it.",1,92,17
I thought there would be more Millennium production on this. Maybe Teddy prefers R.Tee to pass the torch to and is pushing Blacklabel?,1,134,23
Phenomenal. Applause.,1,21,2
"Blonde Ros√© is my fav, i love that look on her",1,46,11
Lol 4 new songs...,1,18,4
Both tracks share the spotlight in terms of promotion. So we'll likely have choreography for the subtitle track and it will get played along side KTL at events.,1,160,28
DDDD remix will be #2 behind KTL on the Korean charts just watch. üòÇüòÇ,1,68,14
Can someone explain to me why the first two songs are labeled ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù and ‚ÄúSubtitle‚Äù?,1,85,15
Modern Art.,1,11,2
"Yeah, even though I‚Äôve heard remixes of DDDD, it‚Äôs intriguing to think what they are going to do with it. ",1,106,20
Very witty üòÇ,1,12,3
I love them all equally! but if push comes to shove ill pick jisoo because shes the reason why i discovered blackpink,1,117,22
Jisoo is goddess!,1,17,3
this....this hit me more than ros√©‚Äôs high note in whistle,1,57,10
"Ros√© is my bias. - Her voice. She‚Äôs so passionate when she sings. Nothing better than playing her cover of Eyes Closed while driving home at 2 A.M. üòå - Similar to how Rosie speaks Korean with an accent, I speak my own mother tongue with an English accent. She seems so much more relatable knowing that we share that similarity. - Her Aussie accent!! üòç The first thing that drew me in was that she was from abroad. Still can‚Äôt get over her accent to this day lol. - Western musical influences - despite being a kpop idol, it seems like her musical tastes are still pretty western / indie. Again, so relatable. (Her indie ass must be so excited for Coachella lol) - Her constant pursuit for self improvement. Based on the books she reads and comments from other members, she never seem satisfied staying status quo whether it be staying back late to practice or reading self help books. - From her vlives to Instagram posts, Rosie just seems like a genuinely kind person. I‚Äôm sure I have more but I figured five reasons would be enough. üòÜ",1,1036,191
Jisoo! She has a great personality and I think she is the ‚Äúglue‚Äù member of the group!,1,85,17
LMAO I RELATE TO THIS SO HARD ,1,30,7
"Remember this is a YG artist we are talking about. Expect less, appreciate more.",1,80,14
It's true. üòÇ,1,12,3
Im calling in the morning. Thanks for the info. üòÑ,1,49,10
"I'm a film buff so I watch a lot of foreign movies around the world. Korean cinema is always impressing me with their creativity and quality output. Hong Kong cinema made some great movies (ie In The Mood for Love, 2046, Infernal Affairs) back in the day but I sort of stopped paying attention to Chinese movies since Mainland China took over. The problem with the Chinese film industry is they rely too much on star power to prop up their films to the detriment of quality writing or anything else really. It used to be a majority of the production budget would go to the movie stars that the government had to step in and cap the percentage they can get. China considers the film industry one of it's pillars so there's a lot of subsidization and big money be thrown at it. Film companies are spending more than then they can make at the box office and the bubble will burst if they don't slow down and make good movies. It doesn't help that there's also censorship laws and that limits what kind of films can be made that can appeal to a global audience.",1,1057,197
That makes sense! ,1,18,3
Masta wu left? He did lyrics for Rose by Lee Hi I think as well,1,63,15
"Why were people expecting this EP to have at least 5 songs, when Square Up only had 4? I think most people were expecting 4 songs.",1,130,26
So not a cover of the epik high song of the same name then.,1,59,14
or if you post 92392819378 memes.,1,33,6
I think D4 remix could be an english version for coachella,1,58,11
"No worries, I'll see what i can come up tonight.",1,48,10
Not hating. I'm just saying make a great one and post it. Those are really basic level but ok. Good luck with your classes.,1,123,24
"Haha, it's 7pm where I'm at so I'm just getting them in before the deadline. Also, I'm starting classes tomorrow, so this is my only free time.",1,143,27
It's about time BP has more than 1 videos! They haven't done that since 2016 IIRC. ,1,83,16
I feel like Hope Not is the ballad one,1,38,9
Chill bruh. This is the third one in an hour. Focus on quality instead of quantity. ,1,84,16
lisa since day 1 but love em all ,1,33,8
"I don‚Äôt think any BLINK is stoked about the release cadence of their songs. What bothers me is people acting like they are surprised when they get exactly what was promised, like somehow they were magically going to get an LP. No one should have been surprised by this.",1,269,49
quality over quantity,1,21,3
hope the remix is a rock remix,1,30,7
well it wouldnt stop them from working with Masta Wu even if he had left. ,1,74,15
"People were expecting at least 5 NEW songs not 4 songs and a remix that no one wants or needs. I don‚Äôt understand why people act like the small amount of songs they have is acceptable. Y‚Äôall jump at anyone who gets upset when they have every right to be. 3 years,13 songs, that‚Äôs embarrassing and unacceptable and if people are upset they can be. It‚Äôs not being ungrateful if it‚Äôs been 3 YEARS. ",1,395,74
as requested by UMG?,1,20,4
Oooh maybe! Especially since they titled it as a sub-title ,1,59,10
i hope its a banger too. hopefullt 2 videos?!,1,45,9
At this point I believe no. I lost all faith. ,1,46,10
"4 new bangers and I couldn't be happier. ""Subtitle"" title track? Could this supposed spy concept be a 2 parter? Am I getting my hopes up too high for 2 mv releases this comeback? I hope Jennie wears as many wigs as the number of songs they have. I'm beyond excited to see the album packaging details! ",1,301,57
"I‚Äôm an 80‚Äôs baby, in the US, and fairly new to Kpop/Blackpink. As a result, I‚Äôm not well versed on how other KPop artists/groups release their music. All I know is a couple of things. 1. How Western artists operate, and we might get an album every other year. I don‚Äôt mind 4-5-6 songs every 9 months or whatever it is here. It really is quality over quantity in this case. The proof is in the catalog. We‚Äôre getting mega hits every drop, no filler. Well maybe this time with a DDDD remix, but I guess we‚Äôll have to hear it to find out. 2. Does this seriously make you any LESS of a fan? Because I don‚Äôt see how and why it would. If you take a step back and look at what they‚Äôve accomplished, there‚Äôs a method to the madness indeed. And it‚Äôs working. ",1,750,146
Let‚Äôs hope all songs get a mini movie style M/V,1,47,10
"My bias is Jisoo for many reasons: * She is a good unni for the other girls * She seems very smart and comfortable as the leader for the group * She is a gamer and doesn't let anyone give her trouble about it * She is really funny and playful with the other members * Her English is adorable * Her singing is top notch * Oh, and she is ridiculously beautiful She also has a natural ability for harmonizing. The girls talk about this but Blackpink songs don't tend to have too many harmonies, but when I finally saw their Sure Thing cover I realized what they were talking about. She sings beautiful harmonies throughout the entire song.",1,636,120
I‚Äôm calling it right now ‚Äúkick it‚Äù is gonna be the best song,1,60,13
We'll probably see a choreography for the sub-title track too. Would be stupid to hire 4 world class choreographers just for the title track.,1,141,24
"I feel pretty confident that you will be able to see the stage well and will not have your view blocked if that is what you are worried about. In addition, there will be enormous screens up that you will definitely be able to see no matter where you sit. Honestly, no matter how close I am at a concert, I often end up watching the video boards since you can see the artists so much better there anyway. And the energy of the live music is the same no matter where you're looking. I have a feeling that you would have to buy two tickets, but I would strongly suggest that you go for it. Being around 16,000+ other people who love our girls as much as we do (or are just BP-curious) should be amazing!",1,700,137
Looks like I'm in business. üòà,1,29,6
"My fav is Lisa because she's 1. the prettiest and cutest thing to exist ever 2. a distinctive happy and bubbly personality that shows through anytime the girls are on camera 3. genuinely a kind and sweet person 4. displayed little personality quirks and reactions that I personally resonate with 5. a hella good dancer, like top 5 in all of kpop (top 3 maybe evenüëÄ) 6. longdari Lisa Not gonna lie, Ros√© has been siphoning a lot of my Lisa bias these days. If Lisa makes the bias cutoff at a 10, Rose is a 9.85. Give me a month and my bias might actually change üò©",1,562,108
"Like I said before, it was announced as a mini album awhile ago, you are acting like you are surprised. No one was expecting this to be an LP.",1,142,29
"It's not like you're barred from producing tracks for someone if you're not a part of the agency. Masta Wu is close with YG and it's artists and producers. He's probably someone TEDDY trusts, so I see why TEDDY wouldn't hit him up. ",1,232,43
This should be permanentttttt &gt;;(,1,36,5
They're going for constant releases through the year over full albums that require alot of investment and half the tracks get neglected. There's still another mini album and 3 solos to look forward to.,1,201,34
"Same feelings here. But I believe this proves something too, the joke reflects certain expectations towards a particular company sigh",1,133,20
Was hoping there wouldn't be any Acoustic/Remix songs so  can finally drop that lame joke *sigh*,1,96,16
first release of theirs to not feature pink!!! ddu du remix sounds dope af (still wish the AIIYL remix would get a release). ,1,125,23
As long as the songs are fire like Square Up 4 new songs is fine. It's all about quality.,1,89,19
"I was expecting more than four new tracks and a remix no one asked for. The vast majority of other k-pop artists manage this, why can't they?",1,141,27
"Mine has always been Lisa. I got into Blackpink right after their debut, and she just stuck out to me right away. Been my bias ever since. She‚Äôs talented, cool, has the ability to switch personas on and off stage, kind, pretty. That being said, I could also use all of those adjectives to describe the other members too lol. ",1,325,60
She‚Äôs changed her hair every time. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs gonna stop any time soon lol,1,83,16
wooo Lydia Paek !!! Love her work,1,33,7
I've never been so ready and also so unready at the same time before!!!!,1,72,14
I don‚Äôt have any BP memes!!! I only have one BTS one lmao ,1,58,13
"OK, I'm game. Kanye West, my all-time favorite artist, put out 27 songs between 2016 and 2018. This isn't counting collaborative albums like KSG. Blackpink can't even manage half. And why do you immediately jump to the ""how about Western artists???"" defense? Because you're aware of how embarrassing BP's release schedule is within the scope of their own industry?",1,364,59
But Hope Not should be an old track like Forever Young? As Masta Wu left YG in 2016. I think they still have many songs left out in the dungeon,1,143,30
"Hey y'all, does anyone know what time the soundcheck is??? I got VIP so idk when to get there",1,93,19
Hope Not should be an old track like Forever Young? As Masta Wu left YG in 2016,1,79,17
I don't know the legality around remixes but it's probably something they can perform on stage but since they can't sell it on any CD's I don't know if it counts or not tbh,1,172,34
I love April 1,1,14,4
"Nobody knows for sure at this point? But i think there were news about there being 2 versions, so probably? Preorders tomorrow if i had to guess?",1,145,27
"YES. FINALLY. I can't wait for the EP release. I'm a bit neutral over the DDDD Remix, but interested in how they'll remix it. I'm honestly fine with 4. 5 would have been ideal, but 4 will do. I'm almost certain that **Hope Not** will be a ballad. Lydia Paek was a main producer for Lee Hi's debut album and has worked on other projects. Mainly RnB influenced. Seo Won Jin worked on the production of BLACKPINK's 'STAY' along with TEDDY. Finally Masta Wu is mainly a lyricist and has worked on Lee Hi and Hi Suhyun's, 'I'm Different' and other songs that I can't recall. ",1,570,106
"This is a smart move, it's time to go global for real",1,53,12
THEY ARE üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•,1,15,3
"OK, so the one thing that stands out to me most is 04 (Hope Not). My favorite 2NE1 song is *Ugly*, cowriten by Lydia Paek. She also wrote BP's AIIYL and half of Le Hi's first album.",1,181,37
I was hoping we'd see less Teddy but I'm pumped regardless! I love the styling/concept of the teasers so far.,1,109,20
"In the summer (June-July likely, probably before their Australian tour) for Ros√©, not sure about the other two yet. As for the next EP, all we know is it will be the upcoming fall.",1,180,34
18hrs earlier from the regular release ill take it ,1,51,9
Y E S,1,5,3
"What were you expecting? They announced it was going to be a mini album months ago. They are going to have another comeback in the fall (also an EP) along with the other member‚Äôs solos, starting with Chaeng. I kind of prefer this, it just means we get new BP all year.",1,268,52
"You can be critical for sure, but at least phrase it in a reasonable way. ",1,74,15
"Oh yeah, when‚Äôs that coming out?",1,32,6
"Why do I have to always love YG groups?! It hurts so much because any other management would give a group this successful a full album and solos for all the members already. I am excited for this EP, I just want BLACKPINK to be as successful as possible because they are amazing.",1,279,53
"Jisoo hands down. Ros√© is a close 2nd, but I love them all equally.",1,67,14
"Not this year, there will be another EP in the fall though and the other member‚Äôs solos, starting with Chaeng.",1,110,20
Ros√© though. I hope they change it up like her first teaser photo.,1,66,13
"Lol there's really a remix of 4D , but anyway we are having 4 new songs to go! Excited!",1,87,19
"My heart üíò... We are getting 4 new songs and a remix. Square Up was just 4, but we loved it. Let's love this EP even more. With the global attention Blackpink has received since Square Up, I think they may be smashing records again! Let's hope Kill This Love makes it to the Top 10 of the Global Billboard Chart. Support and love for Blackpink is support and love for everyone! They've worked extremely hard, so please don't be mean based on YG's actions. Love Blackpink, and you will be loved üòÑ... Kill This Love Everyone!!!!",1,526,97
"I am so excited!!!! Five new songs!!!!! DDDD is one of my absolute top favorite songs, period, by any artist, so I am open to hearing a remix! It could be super fun! And it's so basically new! I love that we have track names now. Ngl, a midnight release is AMAZING news too! Not only do we get it sooner, but I don't have to get up at 5 a.m. to hear it (which I was 100% still planning to do lol). If there are any other EST Blinks reading this, it's 11 a.m. our time!",1,468,97
"I guess it's all a out perspective because I considered Jennie's Solo being fed a four-course meal in November so it's been more like 5 months for me. I realize it was one song by one member, but she killed it.",1,210,41
You mean it's not an acoustic version? LOL,1,42,8
4 songs and a remix? Are they ever going to release a full studio album?,1,72,15
Oh yessss!!! I'm in Western USA so it's super fun for me to stay up late for BP music to drop. I remember doing that for AIIYL.,1,127,27
"Ros√© is my 'bias' because i love her voice and emotive singing, she has the best accent in the world, she can play guitar and piano, she seems really thoughtful and is the most introverted of the four which is endearing. I really like all of them though, Ros√© just somehow was the one i intrinsically had the biggest connection to from the get go, sometimes one cannot explain why exactly :D ",1,392,72
Absolutely loving these visuals! Can't wait to hear the new songs!,1,66,11
Jennie is my bias but Rose is looking ridiculously good in this comeback.,1,73,13
Have any sites announced a pre-order yet or is this going to be a digital only release? I've not seen anything concrete either way.,1,131,24
are we getting a physical album or not?,1,39,8
Excellent now we can get a full LP comeback in 2021,1,51,11
Oh yeah! Few new songs!,1,23,5
No negativity on the reddit forum please. We all should be happy they are even dropping a comeback with how busy they are. ,1,123,23
"I‚Äôd have to say mine is Jennie. She‚Äôs beautiful, has powerful stage charisma, our taste in fashion are similar, and it‚Äôs nice to have a petite boss woman to look up to and get inspiration from :)",1,195,37
"Exactly, so 2 mini albums equals 1 western artists album. Some western artists come out with an album every 2-3 years. So 8-10 songs every 2-3 years.... oh wait.... kinda like BP. See, not a big deal. ",1,201,37
Hope the sub title is as good or even better than forever young,1,63,13
"I‚Äôm happy we‚Äôre getting new songs; of course I do wish there were more, but I‚Äôm hyped as fuck anyway! (But lmao @ that D4 remix ugh)",1,132,27
If 4 new songs is all we can get then I'll take them and love them with my whole heart. Also this styling plus Jennie bangs? üôåüôåüôå,1,128,27
"So are we ever going to get a way to actually buy the album or.....? Jesus, they look so great though. Let me buy their album already YG jesus.",1,143,29
Queens. Look at them doubling their discography in ONE YEAR!! We have a full album worth of songs now!!! Being a BLINK is hard üòÇüò≠üò≠,1,130,25
Name a couple of your favorite artists that isn‚Äôt KPop. How often do you get new music from them? Maybe once a year? Maybe? I don‚Äôt see the big deal. Especially after this is what said would happen. They‚Äôre probably going to drop an album next. With the solos dropped along the way. ,1,283,53
We officially need more than two hands to count all the songs boys and girls!! üò≠ ,1,81,16
Ight thx,1,8,2
If R.tee is involved in all the songs this definitely will be really good.,1,74,14
Do you even hear yourself You're rationalizing being fed rations eight months after the last release which was equally sparse Four songs is a *tiny* EP,1,151,26
? Elaborate? ,1,13,2
No this is 4 new songs which will hopefully all be just as amazing as the 9 songs we got so far!,1,96,22

Oh yeah for sure. It‚Äôs the most basic form of photoshop but it‚Äôs also the cheapest. The point is just to put the product and the girls there and that‚Äôs it. That way the company still has an ad and it cost them nothing.

"\[Offtopic\] The Wandering Earth was also quite well received in Hong Kong too. But yes you are right, most of the Mainland Chinese films were quite bad, and in the past 10 years, as HK's movie industry was in trouble for finding investments, many HK movies had to cooperate with Mainland Chinese productions, and the overall quality of many HK movies has been decreased since then, though there are now some new local hopes for HK movies.

This movie was the first China made blockbuster to get positive reception internationally although it didn't make much overseas as most the box office gross was still in China but it's seen as a positive first step for their movie industry. Although I have my doubts they can be a force in the movie industry internationally, not with restricting creativity through censorship. ",1,519,88
"I think I've heard of the movie, isn't it the one where they try to move the Earth with giant rockets or something. The Chinese movie industry is killing it at the moment, I'm pretty sure that like 3 of the top 5 highest grossing movies of this year so far are Chinese made.",1,274,54

It was originally a Wonder Girls song but the BP version is so heavily remixed and the lyrics are mostly different it might as well be a BP song at this point. ,1,160,32
This belongs in a museum ,1,25,5
"Maybe a stupid question, but is that music from that show or is that music from BP's new song?",1,94,19
"It is just a very loud minority, i am aware of that but it still makes the whole fanbase look bad because even a minority is rather large when we are talking about this fanbase :D It is especially a bad look because it really is only about there not being teasers for 2 days, i get that Blinks would want the time till the comeback to be used 100%, but still.... Sometimes i'd want people to be a little more chill.",1,415,82
"I was super stoked to see that Anda would be releasing more music sooner than I expected, then to see blinks moaning that it's not BP related breaks my heart and embarrasses me a little, having said that there is still alot of support from blinks, more positive than negative but still disappointing.",1,300,53

"I think it's pretty weird tbh. The whole ""shipping idols"" culture is honestly just really weird to me. These are actual, real people, not some characters intended for entertainment. If they're gay or not, it's up to them to come out of the closet, and pushing our own ideas of their sexuality -- especially when they're originating from a country that is not the best regarding same sex relationships anyway -- is just ... wrong.

I really hope once Chase Center is finished in SF, they can have a concert here! Those babypink dolls were cute too! Somewhat sad we never got to see Lisa covering Drake's In My Feelings, oh well. Ros√© panic picking Paper all 3 rounds in Rock Paper Scissors is definitely a mood.

"I think you can consider it as a BLACKPINK song since it's heavily remixed.

For her birthday they also: &gt;did a support video in cafes across South Korea that were 30 seconds long 100 times during the day &gt;did a support video that was 30 seconds long on a Bangkok commercial center's LED screen. &gt;donated 50 kilograms of pet food and 1327 yaun to help stray animals in Bejing. &gt;did a vertical screen support message in Gangnam. &gt;put up 560 screen support messages on self-serving ticket machines in Korea. &gt;put up 21 LED billboards in China's Central Business District at 15 seconds per and 120 times a day per ad. &gt;they held a coffee event for Blinks for her birthday in Shanghai where you could get a special coffee sleeve with her photo. &gt;they donated money to a medical institution in Thailand. I think this describes how much power C/K fans really have that I-Fans don't always get to see. They do so much and they're really amazing in their organization and it's always fun to observe them from any fandom how they tailor charity gifts to the idol they support as well as picking out gifts. This might be the last year or two that blackpink accepts presents, really. ",1,1241,221

is that the actress Kim Go Eun with her?,1,40,9
I never would have thought a bathrobe could even be a fashion thing. Maybe it'll be a fashion trend now that Jennie's wearing it.,1,129,24

Most likely not. They're schedule is packed.,1,44,7

"Only my 2nd comeback,couldn't imagine being the ones who were waiting on them since 2012 ",1,89,15
I would like to think so and I think fact fully they are.I think more people responds to Blackpink compared to Twice or Red Velvet etc,1,134,26
"Sure for example really toxic people on social media are probably too obsessed, that's a good example. If i had to guess that is what BP will do a lot now, comeback and then tour around the world and in SEA especially. Would you say that Blackpink is the most popular kpop girlgroup in your country?",1,299,56
And that wasn't even an actual 'ban' basically just a guideline set by JYP that he hoped they would follow. He even said so himself that he can't prevent them from dating.,1,171,32

"My bet is on pretending like nothing happened at all, that's so more like Mr. Yang Hyun-suk",1,91,17
"I mean that wasn't directed at you in particular, but that's definitely a thing these days, people being too into their favorite thing and neglecting other things for it. Anyway, BP got so much more confident with their live performances! I think they said they will come to SEA again ""soon"" as well, hope you can catch them whenever that happens :D",1,349,62
I wonder if when he does finally post something if he will pretend like nothing has been happening or if he will post a statement ,1,130,25
Not gonna lie you had me in the first half,1,42,10
Not at all. These idols are extremely valuable to the company and driving increases risk of something happening to them several-fold. ,1,134,21
Reaction channels seem to be really popular and reacting to BP definitely brings in the clicks as well :D Gonna check that one out to get a better idea ,1,152,29
Oh I see.No of course I maintain the balance.No worries I understand and we all live in reality :) Off the topic here but I never get tired of their live performances and their way of reaching out to Blinks hence the respect for them :) ,1,237,46
From watching the reaction to their MV DDDD by the Fine Bros. :),1,64,13
"Well one can be too obsessed with their hobby where it becomes unhealthy. Like with everything in life, one wants a nice balance of things, like as an example, it would be probably bad if one follows BP that much that they have no life outside of that anymore. It being a really big interest is fine ofc, i also respect them a lot, they feel very genuine and down to earth even though they realistically are big stars.",1,418,79
Did they actually drive? ,1,25,4
I hold a lot of admiration qnd respect for them :) Although I don‚Äôt quite understand what you mean by being too obsessed. Magic in the air,1,138,27
"Yeah Blackpink is definitely a gateway into kpop as well, though i think they will always stay my favorite group, hard to imagine otherwise. I also really like bigbang, their stage presence is unrivaled in kpop, i hope they can work without seungri, we will see. I am a metal fan, which makes it even weirder that i like BP that much :D",1,336,63
"I am also pretty deep into the rabbithole that is blackpink, always important to not get too obsessed though but i am sure you have a healthy balance there :D Anyway, it is great to see that the girls can do that for people, that's real life magic if you ask me. ",1,263,52

"I spent my holidays watching their Weekly Idol and other shows,watched as many vlives as I found.I followed a lot of fanpages of them and I‚Äôm glad they posted old vlives,videos &amp; photos. I really turned crazy for them.My wallpapers are them,everytime I see a photocard of them I‚Äôll surely get them if I can. Who knew,even though I won‚Äôt be able to interact with them or something I‚Äôll still get the light I need by simply listening/watching them. They didn‚Äôt kill this love,they brought me love!",1,499,87

Most of us thought Lisa was Jennie üòÇ Lisa is rocking those space buns!,1,70,14
"Thanks man, Coachella is always a blast even. I'm more into electronic music/hip hop in general. I mean I saw them on the Coachella lineup, but wasn't remotely interested till I saw them on US TV. Then I went down the rabbit hole of all their videos, performances, etc. The other positive thing is that I started checking other groups such as Big Bang, 2NE1 from YG. Some BTS, EXO, and Everglow as well hahah.",1,409,75
Gotcha thank you! ,1,18,3
The result must be interesting!,1,31,5

Newly minted 30 year old here! I used to listen to kpop about 10 years ago and stopped afterJYP shipped the Wonder Girls off to the US.. rip. Last June I accidentally came across BLACKPINK‚Äôs cover performance of So Hot when I was reminiscing about WG and the rest was history lol. ,1,281,52
"I hope your right but it's an EP. That's 6 tracks at most. I'm still very excited, don't get me wrong. It's just that I think I'm more excited last year since it's my first, and I do not know what to expect. ",1,208,43
holy fuck i am genuinely not prepared for this,1,46,9
definitely third-ed ,1,20,2
I can‚Äôt wait to hear the song and see the choreo!! I miss the girls,1,67,15
Lisa looks so adorable omg ,1,27,5
I want that car!! üòç,1,19,5
"Ngl, love Jennie but THIS time they‚Äôre kinda right... her vocal color didn‚Äôt quite match with the song, and it appeared she struggled a bit with maintaining volume.. we barely hear her at one part.",1,197,35
"I hope they sell merch online in a preorder type fashion. Buying at the venue is not fun lol But with just a few weeks until the US tour starts, I hope they announce something soon.",1,181,36
First as well! I listened to Kpop back in 2009 but stopped after I graduated high school in '11. I literally found BP because of a dance emote that came out on Fortnite. I instantly thought it looked like Kpop and looked it up. I think it was a part of Lisa from AIIYL and now I fell back in love with Kpop! ,1,308,63
"This is great to hear, finding something which gives you happiness is essential in live, glad that BP could do that for you :) If you haven't already, check out their vlives, especially really old ones. Some really wholesome content in there!",1,242,42
Haha exactly,1,12,2
"Yeah that makes sense, i think there is still a kpop touch to it, especially in the form of shaking things up during the song. I personally love that.",1,150,29
The original photo was released as 9 separate images on Instagram. I think OP or someone else quickly removed the white space between them to get one completed look. Check out [@kia_onbeat](  and it will make more sense. ,1,221,38
The 3 years thing was Twice's rule. I never heard it applying to BlackPink. ,1,76,14
"My second, too, but for some reason I am WAAAAAAAY more hyped for this one. Maybe it's wishful thinking that we'll get more than 4 songs this time! ",1,148,28
"Second BP comeback for me, and yes, it really IS this hype every time. I discovered them RIGHT before AIIYL dropped and then the 364 day drought happened, lol so I actually think I was more excited for Square Up (if that's even possible). At least this time around they were touring and we knew YG was probably obligated to release this before Coachella and the US tour- last time we had the unexplained hiatus and the comeback literally got pushed back like 4 times. But either way I'm still SO freaking excited and I start getting antsy around 7:30 every day now waiting for another teaser to drop!! I really think this might be BP's best comeback yet and they've gotta go big this time around which makes it even more hype, I still can't believe I'm gonna get to see them live next month T__T",1,795,147
YES with the Lara Croft realness! This comes out on my BF's birthday and I already told him that we can celebrate a different day because his b-day happens every year but a Blackpink Comeback is once in a lifetime üñ§üíóüñ§üíóüñ§üíóüñ§üíó,1,222,41
So is Jennie going to be blonde or not?,1,39,9
"There is a merch store when they were in my country, but it maybe cheaper if you order online. ",1,95,19
"But aren‚Äôt we going to Kill This Love? Mixed signals, haha",1,58,11
"Believe me. Here in Thailand, it's not that expensive and not as difficult as you imagine. She was back here visiting her family several times since she started training. Without managers. Plenty of time an opportunities. Many kids here can obtain licenses without driving skills. If you can manage an easy parking, you'll get it. ",1,331,55
Mygosh 4 gorgeous Lara Croft! Can‚Äôt waiiiiit for next week!! üò≠üíñüíñ,1,64,11
"Hehe :D It is awesome though, diversity in the community is neat! How did you get aware they exist?",1,99,19
Weird photoshopping of Jennie‚Äôs right leg...,1,44,6
Lisa looks so fucking adorable with that hair!,1,46,8
It's a luxury to even own a car and drive in Thailand and the roads are dangerous. Are you trying to make my point? LOL. And how would this apply to Korea where she's banned from driving?,1,187,37
"At the risk of sounding like an ""anti"" I think there are a lot of legitimate criticisms when it comes to the ""I Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You"" cover. I assume she loves the song but it just doesn't really seem to fit her voice that well, at least not the way she's singing here. I don't think there was anything wrong with her SOLO performance at all and props to her for actually singing live, but I'll just say I wasn't surprised or even upset when I saw how  felt about it. Jennie got a ton of undeserved hate there for that whole ""lazy"" thing which *was* ridiculous but in *this case* I don't think it's just ""BP antis.""",1,624,122
I'm so excited! It has indeed that Tomb Raider-vibe..that set looks amazing honestly! I'm hoping that we will get album design reveal and/or preorders notice next!,1,163,26
I started listening to blackpink and kpop after the kda pop stars performance for lol worlds!,1,93,16
That is a really big reason I Stan blackpink. They seem really genuine and down to earth.,1,89,17
An ethnicity option would be cool!,1,34,6
"Oh yes of course, Bigbang is a global thing. I hope BP could be even bigger, like they could take part in more social activities if they could or even other types of entertainment aspects like movies or TV dramas. But of course music should still be their first priority and BP's songs are really in high quality.",1,313,58
I am the exact same as you as much as I‚Äôm hyped for avengers this is my first blackpink comeback and this is what I‚Äôm most excited for in April. I also would not have believed this one year ago!,1,194,40
LOL This is Thailand we're talking about. Have you ever been on Thai roads?,1,75,14
you are in for a treat then couz every comeback they have never disappoints it takes time compare to other group but its always worth it ,1,137,26
"Yeah, and also you add a year when the new year starts. there have been many people speaking out about changing this system. For example, PSY is was born on December 31, 1977 which means two days after he was born he was considered a two year old! If they change it, everybody gets like 2 years younger LMAO",1,307,59
Best to avoid that place. You can sense their fear with this comeback.,1,70,13
"AND of course all the ""vocal experts"" on  are ripping the performance apart",1,75,13
I find most Kpop music inferior to YG's music. The last group I really loved was BIGBANG but they went into the army. If BP were to disband tomorrow I would be done with Kpop for good.,1,184,37
I‚Äôm with you üòç,1,14,4
"I actually listened to Come Back Home before, but as I didn't like Kpop at that time I didn't have any special feelings about it. No offense but in fact until now I still find some of the styles of Kpop artists, mostly male, too ""foppish"", though their songs are not bad. ",1,272,52
"You should listen to 2NE1 songs, Teddy exclusively produced most of their music and you'll the influence of that carried onto BP.",1,129,22
"No wonder as I listen to more BP and songs of other YG artists, I have a feeling that these pop songs are not that ""Kpop"" ",1,122,26
"You can't just take a drivers test without practicing lol, when did she have time for that? YG forbids them to drive b/c they can get into accidents. It's in the contract.",1,171,32
  - Jisoo wearing it  ,1,22,4
wait members wore krunk? I wished Krunk appeared during their concert in my country but no :(,1,93,17
I think she got a license in Thailand. It only takes a couple of days off her visiting home. And it's not difficult to get an international driving license after that.,1,167,31
Anyone interested in tagging along for the show in Paris? Don't really have friends who are into kpop. Don't wanna go alone tho! PM/DM me!,1,138,25
"It‚Äôs crazy how i used to dislike KPOP 3 years ago.Then that same year I discovered Twice,and I thought okay,it‚Äôs not bad.It was a month after DDDD I discovered Blackpink,I immediately starting liking BP.At first I stan Jisoo because of her beauty,her humour,her vocals and everything about her.Then I discovered Blackpink house last year september,and watched a family being so happy together.I started to stan all of them,as every each one of them brought me back up to my feet.It may be exaggerating or whatsoever when I say they really changed my life because they did.I‚Äôm mad?Blackpink makes me happy &amp; calm again.I‚Äôm sad? Blackpink does it again.I‚Äôm really into Blackpink and this is my first ever Blackpink comeback and I‚Äôm so excited! Every teaser they post I share it on Instagram on Twitter. Unfortunately I missed their concert this year and hopefully they‚Äôll be back in Singapore next year!",1,905,150
Haha. Funny and very siily tbh,1,30,6
"Yes. I agree. Which is why i'm hoping the Blonks don't try to ruin what could be something amazing for the future. Pharrell is an incredible asset to have. They seem to be on the BlackLabel studio, so, shouldn't be too surprising if we ended up with a song. I would love a Jenlisa sub-unit w/ Pharrell producing. ",1,313,58
"Imagine getting to meet a such a talented and inspirational artist. Good for you, Pharrell.",1,91,15
"They can date now, they have to be debuted for 3 years in order for the ban to be lifted. Idk about the others ",1,111,24
"Already iconic. I don't even know what i would do if they ended up collabing. Like, this is next level ishhh. ",1,110,21
"I love how confident she became. Solo was the best thing that ever happened to her. You can see how much shes grown. She is confident in her talent, you can see how happy she is when she's performing. Happy Jen truly is the best Jen. ",1,234,46
I think it‚Äôs considered dangerous.,1,34,5
Others are fine but whats wrong with driving?,1,45,8
Others are fine but what's wrong with driving? ,1,47,8
"Drinking, smoking, clubbing, driving, plastic surgery, and dating are all banned according to their contract. ",1,110,15

"I know their connection is more fashion oriented (thru Chanel), but i ain't gonna lie, i would really be all about a song collab with Blackpink, or maybe even a future solo song. Imagine something funk and cool. Very different than what we expect kpop to be. I would be so down for this. ",1,288,54
I thought Lisa was Jisoo??!! LMAO,1,33,6
They are not allowed to drive? Sad. ,1,36,7
Amen! The last thing we need is another DJ Snake fiasco. Do better people.,1,74,14

It helps their producer Teddy grew up in the US so was influenced by American music and culture at a young age. He's been with YGEnt for a long time and has had heavy influence on the company culture and their music signature. That's why YGEnt music is very distinct from the Kpop industry.,1,290,54
There are so many new blinks!! Reading through the thread it‚Äôs so amazing how diverse everyone is in demographics. I‚Äôve been into kpop since I was a preteen (~10 years) but yes it does feel like this every. Single. Time. Seems like a lot of people experiencing their first comeback and it‚Äôs gonna be so much fun. Lots of new content constantly coming out to keep you on your toes. I still remember where I was and what I was doing and my reactions for all the previous comebacks. It‚Äôs a great time honestly.,1,507,94
It would be impossible or Lisa to have her driver license as she came to Korea at a young age. There was a rumour Jennie owned a car during her training days but I don't know if that's true.,1,190,39

I fell down the rabbit hole known as BlackPink back in September of last year after watching Fine Bros did a reaction vid of them with college kids. From that point on I was a Blink through and through. This will be my first comeback and to say I am excited is an understatement. End Game will be my most anticipated event of April but Kill The Love comes a very close second. ,1,377,73
Most likely both. ,1,18,3

So they have there own customised car now. Amazing. Who will drive? ,1,68,12
"Also note that this is reddit, so it's going to skew more male than a blink demo survey elsewhere like on Twitter.",1,114,22
"Lots of blinks new to kpop in general, that's pretty cool. And yes, this is how it feels every time heh. Kpop is really good at hyping up a groups return to promotions its very involved and there is just a stream of contents made to hype up fans. It's really exciting.",1,268,52
I need more Lisa with space buns! üíó,1,35,8
All I want is love! Their outfits are always amazing!,1,53,10
"I didn't say people don't think it's her. Just he and I don't. I don't need ""facts"" or anything. You may be right, just stating my opinion that she doesn't sound the same in the 2 clips... and I don't need him to translate thanks. ",1,231,45

Everything said is so relatable! My first comeback too. Last October heared D4 and was hooked. Searched everything about the girls listened to all their songs and mvs and dance practice videos and followed them on ig watched blackpink house first without subtitles then with subtitles watched their variety shows and vlives and live performances. Everything within couple of weeks. ,1,382,60
I think it's [her](  She's such a Blink. ,1,41,8
"&gt;Although the sound effects in the music video were distracting. I don't know if that's common or not, but it was odd to me. yeah that was just a directorial choice I guess, I'm happy you liked it though!! Honestly the whole album is gold! yay IU!!!",1,252,47
Jisoo giving me some serious Underworld vibes. Can't wait for this darker looking concept.,1,90,14
"Thanks for explaining. I saw one YouTube thumbnail talking about ‚Äúlazy dancing scandal‚Äù but I hate clickbait titles so I didn‚Äôt click. It‚Äôs interesting that there might be something to that, and I hope she is doing alright. I have to admit, I never got the whole concept of RBF, and the idea that you were entitled to someone smiling for no reason. It‚Äôs pretty discouraging to get downvotes on an open discussion thread as a new fan. I wasn‚Äôt being combative or asking people to stop. I just genuinely wanted to understand. I appreciate the explanation. I hope she keeps doing what she‚Äôs doing and that they all get many years of success to come. I have never had a bias as strongly as I have for Jennie. The fact that she has an incredible voice, can dance pretty well, has really clear diction when rapping (in English and Korean), and is SUPER stupidly hot makes her the complete package in my eyes.",1,902,164
#queenslay üë∏‚öîÔ∏è‚ö∞Ô∏è,1,16,2
"I don't know why you re getting downvoted? Jennie does get a lot of hate, I don't even know why. Some people say it's because of the ""lazy"" scandal, where she was very unenergetic and uenthusiastic in her performances. People started calling her a spoiled lazy brat etc. I think this narrative existed before though, what I mean is, even when they were rookies(ish), people said Jennie ""looks like a bitch"" and ""seems mean"" due to her Resting Bitch Face, and there were baseless rumors about her being a bully or something. After that when it was announced that she will debut solo, everyone started talking about how she's ""spolit"" etc. So, I don't think the ""lazy"" scandal is what caused some people to see Jennie in that light, because even before that, some people already had this negative image of her (based on literally nothing) and used that incident to further push that narrative. I think if it were any other member, the reaction would be different, I think there would of course be non-hateful criticism, and yes antis will call them 'untalented', but I imagine the reactions especially from so-called blinks would have more concern, if it were Rosie, Jisoo or Lisa (i.e. ""is she eating well?"" ""i hope she's okay?""). That's just how I feel but I can't be 100% sure. The comments about Jennie went from criticism to straight up mass cyber-harrasment (""stupid spoiled, ungrateful, untalented brat who doesn't care about her fans"" etc.) Okay I literally went on A WHOLE RANT but I can't answer why some people hated her in the first place ??? I think it's just bandwagon hate; I was looking at some comments on YouTube and people were saying ""Jennie is so jealous of Lisa, it's so obvious she hates Lisa look at her face"" etc. (she would literally playfully tease Lisa, or look in her general direction without smiling i.e her RBF face), and others would reply ""Omg yes! I totally see it she's such a fake bitch. I hate her"" ?????? I think some of these people have a confirmation bias ??? Seriously I feel bad for her but I'm hoping those ""blinks"" are just a loud minority but it scared me when these comments get hundreds of likes (that Paradise City CF is an example, lots of blonks were hating Jennie for having more screen-time calling her ""selfish""). Anyway you should not feel BAD AT ALL for biasing Jennie!!!!!! She's AMAZING. I absolutely adore her. And with what you said towards the end, I think Jennie herself said (I forgot where/when) she feels like she's good at everything but not amazing at anything, but that's part of her charm, isn't it? And recently I'm seeing so much Jennie-love on Twitter about that Pharrell Chanel event thing &lt;3 UwU she looked so confident and enthusiastic on that stage, there were definitely people who kept hating on her saying she can't sing, she ruined the song, but what can you do, success attracts the haters.

By far the best keyboard I know of. Pretty much my end game. But I'll stick with my Anne Pro 2 and eat normally for now. I don't want to eat instant noodles for the rest of my life lol.,1,185,40

Same goes for China. The reason is in these countries you automatically start out as 1 year old when you're born.

"I got chills during the intro of 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You'. Plus her rap was so raw and charismatic. A lot of people think putting BLACKPINK on Tour with only 9 songs was too early for them, but I disagree. While it sucks to only perform with 9 songs, it feels like they've gained so much confidence on stage in the sense that they're comfortable adlibbing and flowing with the music. They were already dope af when they strictly followed their routines and choreographies, but not as confident breaking out of them. This tour has helped them so much. Plus Jennie's 'SOLO' era has really made her more confident on her own which is what YHS wanted to accomplish with each of their solo debuts.

Does she get hate because she does something wrong, or is just the label pushing her to the point where people are sick of her? I just don't understand where all the hate comes from. I just think she and Lisa are the bad girls of the group and I find Lisa's voice to have a ""female rapper sound"" similar to Nicki Minaj, that I just don't like the sound of as much. I don't think Jennie is the most talented dancer, singer, or rapper of the group, but I like her voice the most, I like her attitude, and I think she is the prettiest.

Also, Pharrell?! They‚Äôre in a studio? I wonder if they were allowed to stray from Teddy for once and got Pharrell to work on one of the new tracks.",1,326,64

Ateez are probably my favourite at the moment. They haven't been around that long and only have to EP but I like most of their music so far. BTS is an obvious choice I like some songs, not really sure what's so special about them but to each their own. The other bighit group TXT seem to be off to a good start.",1,464,92

I'm not really into the idea tbh, if it was old Pharrell I'd be all about it, I just think his newer stuff is a bit bland. N.E.R.D x BLACKPINK though that would be fire.",1,552,108

"I'm the same way where girl groups interest me so much more than boy groups. Pretty much the only active boy group I follow is Seventeen. Their songs including b sides are always good and their choreo is my favorite among boy groups. Don't Wanna Cry, Adore U, Mansae, Very Nice, and Oh My are my favorite title tracks by them.",1,326,61

"The truck is very much real. If fact you can see it in the making of video. I believe most of their mv are like 90% real props/background. The only exception to this is whistle. Also when you consider the amount of time between shooting and release of MV, there isn't much time for heavy VFX. Everything done in camera is much faster.",1,334,63

"Hi. I majored in film in college. (Not that I know anything really, but I've had a tiny bit of experience for school projects.) It's probably an icecream truck, and they printed out art and stuck it on, like others have said. My question is in the underground railroad scene, did they paint the walls pink, or did they do that in post? Because we know that in SOLO, the washing machines were originally green, then turned to blue. So, yes, they have the money. And their production design team is BOOOOSSS. Question, do they have studios? A lot of things are on location, but does anyone know if there's a giant YG filming lot? Or do KPOP companies have to share? And is it different if you're not one of the big 3? Or do they go to a motion pictures studio? ",1,759,143

"No. Based on the background, this image should be taken in Taipei when before they were having concert there. And she was standing in a night market, as night markets are everywhere in Taiwan especially in Taipei. Also from the stall shown in the image, the candy is actually called Bingtanghulu (ÂÜ∞Á≥ñËë´ËòÜ; meaning ""rocksugar candied bottle gourd"") or sometimes simply Tanghulu (Á≥ñËë´ËòÜ; ‚Äúcandied bottle gourd‚Äù), a traditional Chinese snack of candied Crataegus pinnatifida, also known as mountain hawthorn, Chinese haw, Chinese hawthorn or Chinese hawberry. It is also called shanzha (Â±±Ê•Ç), which is a Chinese fruit. The ""bottle gourd"" in its name refers to the slight resemblance of the snack to the shape of the gourd fruit. This candy is a common snack in the northern part of China, like in Beijing, and rarely found in the South, but some Taiwan night markets still have them. It consists of fruits covered in hard candy on bambooskewers that are approximately 20 cm long. Recently, the haw could be replaced by various other fruits, like strawberries, blueberries, bananas, kiwifruits, pineapples, cherry tomatoes, etc. The pits and seeds of the hawthorn are emptied out and are commonly filled with sweet red bean paste before being skewered and dipped.

"I see this comment all the time, but maybe they simply don't have the skillset to compose music? It's really fucking hard to do that, especially because it needs to be really good as well, i honestly think that YG has the highest standard for anything BP releases which is why teddy and teddy alone made music so far.

Too many American girls start wearing way too much makeup from a very early age.

"Yeah, they're hardly alone when it comes to associating with more famous people. It seems to be the Instagram business model I guess. Not throwing hate, but just had to get it off my chest and see how much of the board knew about it too. I'm a pretty cynical girl so when I kept noticing Ella always getting top comments (I follow all 5 BP accounts) I was like, okay, but this is strictly business why she's posting so much. It wasn't ""Ahhhhh Ella and her unnniiiiieeees"" \*adorable\* like how other people saw it. I knew nothing of this girl until BP, but I guess she's an American who's also friends with Kristina Pimenova. I don't think she'll ever go into kpop and people who hope she'll become a trainee are just projecting their wishes on her. More likely, given her genetic makeup (biracial Eurasian who looks 90% Korean with subtle western features in just the right places) she'll be well accepted in the Korean cosmetics/beauty industry (because of many Koreans' fawning over that look) which might be more of her mother's long term goal. Her mom is pretty restrained though when you compare her to some others. From my observations, Russian moms tend to be the most exploitative with ""promoting"" their daughters' careers.",1,1232,215

&gt; I don't wanna set myself up for disappointment I believe this comeback will break records. The fanbase has grown exponentially since Square Up. If you compare the first teaser of the Square Up era to Lisa's poster it beat the likes/retweets in just under 1 hour. &gt; Though i am optimistic that the next wait won't be 9 months again I think things will be different going forward. This western expansion in combination with Interscope lit a fire under YGEnt's ass.,1,470,82

You're not wrong. It is what it is tbh. It doesn't hurt anyone so personally Ima just let it rock.

I now think it's a wig too since she would never dye her hair this drastic bc she gets a lot solo CF's and this hair colour draws too much attention. But yhe picture looks very convincing if u don't know anything about wigs.,1,224,44
"Man, so many recently deceased BLINKS in this thread. ""Blonde Jennie? I'm dead, I'm deceased, I've shuffled off this mortal coil"" So how are you typing that? ""BRAINS! \[moan\]"" Who knew that putting Jennie in a wig would summon the Zombie Blink hoard?",1,251,43
Yeah that's why I was curious if they would be doing any since there is that gap. I'm sure resting would be nice too but hopefully they're able to do some good promo's!,1,168,33
"In the part, you can't see any scalp or roots, and the hair looks like it's sort of matted in and around the part to ""hide"" this. If you look at other pics where Jennie's hair is parted in the middle, it makes it a bit more obvious that this isn't how her hair naturally falls. Her recent shoot with Dazed has a few good shots of this. Also something about the way the front pieces fall make the hairline look very undefined and unnatural. My experience with wigs comes from having a friend who had cancer and wore wigs while undergoing chemo. Still, I would not consider myself an expert by any means and could be totally off base with this. I'm sure there are products and techniques that could've been applied to her natural hair that could achieve the effects I described above. Regardless, Jennie is totally rocking the blonde look so if it is her natural hair that was dyed, I am here for it! ",1,899,168

Definitely. The part and the hairline are dead giveaways that it's a wig. ,1,74,13

"**YG Entertainment: 'BLACKPINK's 'KILL THIS LOVE' Is A Very Intense Song That Goes Beyond DDU-DU DDU-DU' Plus Hints At More US Late Night Promotions** YG Entertainment announced Blackpink's comeback today with a poster of Lisa on its official blog (www.yg-life.com) at 9 am on 25th.The EP album name was decided to be the same as the title song 'KILL THIS LOVE'. Blackpink is coming back after about nine months since the release of DDU-DU DDU-DU in June last year. YG Entertainment said that Lisa's first teaser captures the atmosphere of 'KILL THIS LOVE' perfectly. KILL THIS LOVE is a very intense song that goes beyond DDU-DU DDU-DU.Also, in regards to the new dance choreography, YGE said ""the choreography of KTL is more dynamic than anything that Blackpink has done before and it will meet the expectations of fans around the world.""Blackpink's last song DDDD music video released in June last year surpassed the record of 700 Million views, which is the the highest views for any kpop group music video and the expectations from the upcoming song are very high. The reason why this comeback is so exciting is that Blackpink will be pushing their full fledge advancement into US by signing a contract with InterScope of Universal Music Group of the United States last year.Black Pink was featured on US famous TV programs CBS '' Late Show '', ABC 'Good Morning America' and 'Strahan and Sarah' in February this year. Broadcast promotion is expected to continue.BlackPink are also invited to perform at Coachella Festival on April 12th and 19th, it is the largest music festival in the United States. From there Blackpink will start local promotion with North America tour with first show in Los Angeles on 17th.   ***** *I am a bot that transcribes allkpop articles.*",1,1774,298

"She works perfectly for moonshot. Never tried anything, but i think i saw Lisa Eldridge (famous makeup artist, A-list celebrities are her clients, plus she works with Vogue UK all the time) using it when she went to South Korea a good time ago (and she really enjoyed it). I think i may give it a try. ",1,302,57
"I think Jennie looks better as a brunette than a blonde, but I will get used to this new hairstyle eventually.",1,110,21
I think I saw Jisoo sporting red hair on social media.,1,54,11
'The leading ladies of Kpop'. It does have a nice ring to it. And it's also 100% FACTS. They are the revolution after all. ,1,123,24
Omg I freaking c h o k e d,1,26,9
Yah my wig was yeeted,1,21,5
I'm here for more content always. Let's go BLACKPINK. ,1,54,9
"Jennie is gonna be the death of me. OMG!!!!!!!! I don't care if it's a wig, if it's bleach, all i care is that she is BLONDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Do you know how long i wanted that to happen? OMFGGGGG!!!!!! I can't take it. This comeback is gonna kill me. They about to kill love, Blinks, haters, everybody. Nobody is safe when BLACKPINK is back in town. ",1,360,65
"BTW, I don't stan Jennie quite as much as many of you, but damn does she look good on the cover of Dazed...",1,107,23
"She's trying to fucking kill us. Shit I actually might be dead right now. Whatever I'll make it work, y'all better love BlackPink or I'll haunt your ass haha. ",1,159,29
Redhead Jisoo is next? Is Lisa going to have the darkest hair of the bunch? That will be a change!,1,98,20
Did anyone‚Äôs tickets arrive in the mail yet? I got the VIP package but I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôll work.,1,99,20
I didn't know it before but Blonde Jennie is exactly what I needed today ,1,73,14
Jennie trending #2 worldwide. üíî,1,31,5
"Stay is easily my favorite BP song so I'm right there with you. I know they're great at the whole girl crush thing and that's what's hot right now, but they could make some amazing ballads.",1,189,36
"Wow, that is different! Honestly I'm not sure that I'm a huge fan of it but it's always fun to see them try something new and I bet it'll grow on me anyway. Jennie was probably the last one I expected to change her hair to this degree, hers was typically pretty consistent comeback to comeback.",1,294,56
We‚Äôll always remember where we were when we saw blonde Jennie for the first time. ,1,82,15
"Alright these girls really know how to shake the internet, just when I thought they couldn't amaze me more they come out with this!!",1,132,24
"Although black is her favorite color, I think being different and makes people wow is the point.",1,96,17
jennie stoppppp. üò≠üòçüíõ,1,20,3
Wow did not expect this! Iconic as she is. This makes her look more mature..in a good way! Now with this look I can imagine how intense their concept is going to be.. I'm not ready,1,180,36
Holy fucking shit! I did not expect this. My girl finally dyed her hair. üòÆüòÆüòÆ,1,76,15
"Yeah, that's what I thought but just wanted to be sure since I just bought my ticket! üòÅ ",1,88,18
You like my hair? Gee thanks just bought it,1,43,9
META Broken!!!,1,14,2
[This video is perfect rn]( ,1,28,5
"maybe unpopular opinion, i don‚Äôt like blonde jennie?? prefer dark haired jennie ",1,80,12
This is a silly question. Of course they will. ,1,47,9
"Omg I'm dead, fucking wow we thought Blonde Jennie was but a dream. She looks so incredible and too powerful. They really bouta take over the world and I for one welcome our Jendeukie overlord!",1,193,35
If Jennie is this good I can't even imagine Ros√©'s. May as well start digging my grave for Jisoo's teaser as well,1,113,22
Oh. Oh no. Guys they're not fucking around. This is no longer a drill. They were as serious as a heart attack about this song going harder than D4. I don't care how ready you think you were. You're not. We're not.,1,213,42
Is this a wig? God I hope not. I literally just screamed.,1,57,12
"This is probably a wig but it's possible she just chose not to bleach the roots to protect her scalp. Either way, A+ look. Whoever at YGE made this pic knows what they are doing. If you set the twitter original to your desktop, her face is dead center and the top of the screen just reads 'LOVE'. :)",1,299,59
YG stock price is rising,1,24,5
Wow the other end of the spectrum!!!! Thought Jennies hair was gonna stay black.,1,80,14
Cannot fucking believe it....... SHOOK,1,38,5
"If it isn't just a wig, sure. Would be nice, i like her in blonde",1,65,15
If it's her real hair I pray for her scalp. ,1,44,10
Historical Moment,1,17,2
Looks pretty real ,1,18,3
This question just make me laugh üòÇ ,1,35,7
Is there any chance that they will preform the new songs during their US and EU tour?,1,85,17
"Me too, she is horrible at keeping a secret üòÇ",1,45,10
i am shook rn,1,13,4
"They usually keep their hair color changes for the remainder of the promotions, so she will likely keep it.",1,107,19
"Quick question, is this hair real? Honest question. It just seems . . . different. ",1,83,15
Holy shit! She looks beautiful. I feel like everyday they'll release a new image teaser,1,87,15
"They finally let Jennie dye her hair, they're not playing around this time",1,74,13
"So will she actually sport this hair when they comeback and in the us, or is this a wig specifically for the picture? I am not sure :D",1,134,28
Is this real or just a wig???,1,29,7
OHMYGOOOOD I THINK I'M GETTING CRAZY.,1,37,6
[blackpinkofficial IG Post](  [Jennie IG Post](  [Ros√© IG Post](  [@ygent\_official Tweet](  [YG-Life]( ,1,104,12
She looks amazing!! üñ§üíñüñ§üíñ,1,24,4
HOLY FUCK!,1,10,2
I was JUST thinking that it would be so cool if Jennie went white/blonde for her hair color. But that it would have to be a wig because iirc her hair does not react well to bleach. I was really hoping they would do this!! YG can afford to drop some dough on human hair lace front wigs.,1,285,58
"Everyone, get ready for short hair Jisoo...",1,43,7
out of all the hair colors this is definitely the one I expected the least üòµ ,1,77,16
**MY WIG**,1,10,2
"It doesn't look like a wig. She really did, she died her hair for Blinks. üò≤",1,75,16
Blinks how are we all alive after this ,1,39,8
"Kill this love? More like kill this scalp. I'm dead though, she looks so good. ",1,79,15
she looks amazing omfg,1,22,4
"WHAT. DYE-PHOBIC JENNIE IS BLONDE?!?! IT MUST BE A WIG. I can‚Äôt believe it! She always looks ready to murder, I love it. (And if that blonde is real, I don‚Äôt expect her to keep it for long haha)",1,194,39
I actually gasped out loud when this came up in my feed. OH MY GOD. It‚Äôs happening. Blonde Jennie.,1,98,19
Holy shit....,1,13,2
Blond Jennie came completely from left field for me. This is going to take some getting used to. ,1,97,18
JENNIE WENT BLONDE!!! I GOT HELLA SPOOKED FOR A HOT SECOND,1,58,11
OMG PLEASE LET THIS NOT BE A WIG üò≠‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠‚ù§Ô∏è,1,39,9
I AM DECEASED omg,1,17,4
I SPOKE TOO SOON. Guess I‚Äôll gladly put away the clown costume !!,1,65,13
"I'm flabbergasted, **JENNIE IS BLONDE &lt;3**",1,45,6
I've just been staring in shock at this for the past 5 minutes,1,62,13
Amazing look...,1,15,2
"YGE just delay half hour let BLINKs hanging there...Good for you YGE, good for you...üòÇ",1,86,15

PHSYCH. BLONDE JENNIE ,1,22,3
"Wow, blonde Jennie came unexpected. She looks great!",1,52,8
Blonde hair Jennie looks like someone you do NOT want to fuck with and I am 100% here for it,1,92,20
SHE FINALLY HAS A NEW HAIR COLOUR!! üò±üò±üò±üò± Wonder if they‚Äôre really going reverse DDDD order. So far so good. ü§î Lisa &gt; Jennie &gt; Jisoo? &gt; Ros√©,1,148,28
YOU GUYS I ACTUALLY DIED,1,24,5
HOLY FK SHE LET THEM TOUCH HER HAIR SHOOOOK,1,43,9
Commenting from my Grave. DECEASED.,1,35,5

‚ÄúThe leading ladies of Kpop‚Äù. Nice!,1,35,6
No teaser today though...,1,25,4
So I guess we‚Äôre not getting a teaser today üòÖ everyone put your clown suits back on,1,83,17
Jobless culture? We don‚Äôt know her. ,1,36,6
Lisa is beautiful ,1,18,3
"yesss loving overflow, their visuals and concept are on point ",1,62,10
"agreed, i hope we have a really diverse set of tracks this time around. i know the queens will not disappoint! ",1,111,21
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been mentioned yet, but props for the mods for doing the header thing! If you hover your cursor on the header (the pic of the pinks) of  the Kill This Love poster comes up. So cool! :) ",1,204,41
Maybe when they get home from the tour we will get some variety shows ,1,70,14
"It sounds like Interscope is pushing for the US marketing right now. With YG only really caring about CFs, it's a better option right now.",1,138,25
That true but they're trying to appeal to the US more because of the tour coming up so it makes sense to put them on US shows right now. ,1,137,29
"So beautiful. Even without the visuals, the song + her voice gives off emotion. ",1,80,14

Good bot,1,8,2
Got my tickets 1st day of presale. Looking forward to this so bad. Been a terrible year so far. Mother inlaw passed away suddenly and i barely see my wife while shes looking after her dad and sorting all tge financials out. This will be a much deserved consolation prize as all our travel money to korea went to funeral expenses etc. So our big korea trip got canned. But a few days in melb sound great. Never visited melb before as well. N.z. blinks reprzent.,1,460,86
Personally I feel like Korean variety shows do a better job showing the members' personalities since they have more experience with kpop idols. But more content is better either way.,1,182,30
I‚Äôm looking forward to a more intense song especially for western audiences,1,75,12
"While we‚Äôre waiting on kill this love, I‚Äôd like to share [a little skit](  I made when Blackpink appeared on gma. Hope you guys enjoyüòÅ ",1,135,25
Thanks a ton!!,1,14,3
"I'm hoping for at least 4 songs too! And, hopefully a ballad song.",1,66,13
"If u wanna share it here, use the [weekly discussion thread.]( ",1,63,11
I really want more Blackpink on my television :),1,48,9
The original has slightly different Ros√© and Lisa scene's as English/Japanese versions and also different bgm.,1,110,16
It was the same stuff as the Jennie and Jisoo parts of the teaser. ,1,67,14
I'm so excited for their comeback! I hope Lisa can get her dance break which she didn't get and I hope to see more ballad song (like STAY) kind of music from them too. ,1,168,34
"Yeah, that‚Äôs actually a good idea. Hope the other companies would agree. Could you imagine a reality show with Black Velvet??",1,125,21
"I feel that, given the context of the scandal, it would be a better move for MORE girl group interactions, like a girl-power/unity thing. ",1,138,24
&gt; BLACKPINK to comeback with mini album THIS IS NOT A DRILL. I REPEAT. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.,1,94,19
"I'm living for Everglow rn honestly. If you haven't checked it out yet, I recommend this fanmade mashup of BBC/D4: [ ",1,117,21
a literal angel wtf,1,19,4
Or Square Root.,1,15,3
First comeback boys ,1,20,3
"I really hope they didn‚Äôt really mean that the girls literally stayed up 4 days straight for this comeback, I love my hardworking queens but they need rest üò≠",1,157,29
Anyone know why Stay on the tour film is the remix (watched the videos on Apple Music) but on the live album stream its the album version instrumental?,1,151,28
&gt;State of  &gt;Jobless culture? No. :) ,1,42,6
"since were getting a song ""more intense than DDDD"", i REALLY hope we get a song even more emotional than ""stay"" too. i absolutely adore stay and hope we get to hear even more of their emotional side.",1,199,38
Rosie‚Äôs smile üòç,1,15,3
"Yes, I love how the ""life is but a dream"" concept from the influential literary work ""The Nine Cloud Dream"" is used and connected to the ""fantasy"" of the hotel, which BP delivers the whole concept beautifully. ",1,210,37
"Same, I really hope there‚Äôs an epic chorus with high energy. Maybe something more emotionally charged? DDDD was very stylized and icy IMO, which was awesome, but I‚Äôm ready to see some angst and fire! I‚Äôd love some belted vocals from Jisoo, she‚Äôs improved sooo much recently and her low notes are incredible. ",1,308,53
"Okay, after watching this english-subbed full version CF, I appreciate very much the whole concept itself, in which they use the influential classical Korean literature ""The Cloud Dream of the Nine"" to introduce the concept of ""life is but a dream"", and then connects it with the ""fantasy"" thing (of a hotel) and BP delivers such concept beautifully. Well done.",1,361,60
"I'm gonna be honest. I thought that first shot was of Rose wearing lace, and I had a heart attack",1,97,20
Waking up to new teaser picture and more everyday from now on till 5th! God bless the blinks the Girls and the petpinks üòÑ‚úåÔ∏è,1,123,24

Blackpink coming to slay and save YG!,1,37,7
"True, the Seungri part will probably catch a lot of other groups with the big net that is being cast. YG also has a tax evasion investigation at the same time. Seems like they are being targeted. I just hope it doesn‚Äôt tarnish the name of Blackpink or limit their activities. ",1,276,51
"I love how the Kill This Love cover pops out when my cursor moves to the top bar and the comeback date design, very good details!",1,129,26
"Not really a lot to say other than being extremely excited for their new EP, i hope we will get information about the number of songs soon, that's what i am most interested in other than actual music teasers. I'll be fine with at least 4 songs, that made sure i am listening to every song of square up, appreciating all the work more or less equally. ",1,351,67
"Nah, this isn't purely a YG scandal, this hit many labels and more will come out. YG had the biggest hit simply because of seungri being the biggest idol in this scandal so far. ",1,178,34
"They said the new song will be more intense than DDDD, the most intense part of that was the rap verses, i expect there to be more of that, probably hitting even harder? DDDD's chorus was something which didn't hit super hard, so i guess that will be the most noticeable difference. What i am a little bit afraid of personally is a chorus which is just one big break with them dancing, i personally am not a fan of that and the news of the choreo being the most dynamic kinda points towards that, but we will see. At the end of the day i am sure it will be awesome, it is really hard for me to dislike anything BP at this point anyway, even kiss and makeup i learned to enjoy after i was a little disappointed at first :D",1,721,143
üëë ‚ù§Ô∏è,1,4,2
"Gotta be some more English rapping (like Jennie - Solo), would be helpful material to have for their US tour coming up in support of the mini LP.",1,145,28
I‚Äôm so thirsty for more teasers omggggg. Lisa looking FIREüî• Anybody have ideas/hopes for the styling/song style??,1,113,17
"With all the YG scandals, do you think the other 2 big kpop companies (SM and JYP) are going to distance themselves from YG? I‚Äôm asking because I love the interaction between Blackpink, Twice, and Red Velvet. Seems if a concerted effort to create some distance was put into effect, there is going to be interaction between the top girl groups. ",1,344,61
"To anyone who hasn't tried yet, these Moonshot cushions are amazing, I'll even use them for my wedding makeup. It's twice the price of my usual cushion but it was worth it.",1,172,32
Wait.. don't tell me the Butterfly things were only for this ?,1,62,12
&gt; majorly viral,1,18,3
Everglow is awesome. Bon Bon chocolat has been one of the best songs of 2019.,1,77,15
"All I can say is wow and I still can‚Äôt calm my heat from that teaser. Also, any blinks digging Everglow? ",1,105,21
oof yeah I don‚Äôt know if I would‚Äôve figured that out. Maybe after a minute or two? If you‚Äôre that lazy why wouldn‚Äôt you just go into your settings and add a keyboard shortcut?,1,175,34
Bp must be everywhere in korean tv with all this cfs,1,52,11
Ugh Rose is soooo prettyyyy,1,27,5
"When I first heard this I wanted to scream form excitement, but my family does not even know I like kpop lol, they would think I‚Äôm crazy.",1,137,27
"Nice to have you here! Enjoy the ride, lot of teasers to come, a lot of stuff to get excited about! Hope to see you in some of these threads, hehe :D",1,149,32
I found it - Queen by Perfume Genius,1,36,8
There is a Eng ver.!!! &amp;#x200B; [  ,1,39,7
Many blinks know that and I think early April is understandable for their rush schedules and because of the shits this month,1,124,22
"I'm soooo excited when I saw this dropped! New fan of BP, I got into them just after they finished promoting their DDDD comeback. Been in the KPOP scene off and on for years but BP is the only group I've been diligently trying to keep updated on with their news. Twitter's Blinks are too toxic and immature for my taste so I decided to create an account here to share my excitement over their comeback because the people here seems more mature.",1,444,83
I agree. It was for international act. Even if they kept North America on the list they should have used a Canadian or Mexican singer instead of Taylor.,1,152,28
Very relatable ,1,15,2
Damn its that bad huh? Hopefully the members didn't see those comments,1,70,12
Lisa knows ball is life,1,23,5
"It is a well done video, no doubt about that. It tells a clear story and anyone getting upset that the girls don't get equal screen time should grow up :P Happy they got the chance to work for this hotel, any additional cf work is good in my eyes, helps both parties!",1,267,53
Stayed at this hotel....most people expectations will be too low once they actually go.So glad BP got to be the models for it,1,125,23
Ros√© looks stunning here ‚ô•‚ô• I mean she always does but wow....,1,62,12
"I think it is definitely interesting, one sees the growth there perfectly :) But we knew from their youtube subs that their growth was insane since DDDD, so it isn't surprising :D",1,179,32
"If they do one (which we will definitely hear about if they do, so don't worry), it should start one hour before the release. Which would most likely mean 5th april 17:00 KST.",1,175,33
I thought their comeback was going to be in March? I knew they were going to push the date further than what they said but like no one has noticed? ,1,148,30
Her eyes are so wonderful!,1,26,5
hope Kiss And Make Up Solo version is included as a bonus track.,1,64,13
3? YG said 6-8 songs,1,20,5
"I hope it actually does give a lot more than dddd, I‚Äôd love to learn some harder choreo from them, or maybe even an actual dance break ( the ones for dddd and forever young were kinda lit but I wanted moRE ) I‚Äôd also like to see that they‚Äôve improved on their synchronization as a group, or just anything along the lines of they‚Äôre improving themselves would be litty.

What time will the vlive start?,1,31,6
She‚Äôs unreal oh my god. I can‚Äôt even imagine how gorgeous she looks irl ,1,72,14
I'm actually amazed that this teaser got 3000+ upvotes in the KPOP subreddit. So excited for the next sets of teaser!,1,117,21
"It gets worse, some people just call it D4",1,42,9
Everyone's expectations of the hotel are too high now. ,1,55,9
Looks like a movie trailer. YouTube comment cesspool full of jealous self-righteous blonks as per...,1,100,15
Damn the production budget on the CF must be insane. Really appreciate the work they put into it.,1,97,18
Does anyone know the song? ,1,27,5
"Omg yesss, I immediately lost interest in the CF when I saw the teaser !!! ",1,75,15
"&gt;tbh I prefer this + another EP this year than one full album a year, after about two or three months we might get tired of the full album songs, but another EP before year ends sounds better &amp;#x200B;",1,207,39
Its what she deserves,1,21,4
"Definitely a memorable cf, appreciate the efforts",1,49,7
Had to delete the first post because it contained only the first part. Pardon me. &amp;#x200B; With the cb teaser out the same day as this CF i dont even care about this one lmfao but at least more exposure for the pinks.,1,221,43
Those comments again though. But the whole CF is still good! ,1,61,11
It's finally here!! So hyped for this!!!,1,40,7
It was posted on  too a couple days back that they already filmed the MV,1,72,15
This is giving me so much K-drama vibes. I love it! ,1,52,11
"They are supposed to have another EP in the fall and the other member solo‚Äôs throughout the year. I actually prefer this, since that means we get new music from BLACKPINK all year.",1,180,33
"Ready for another 3 songs that will be a bop but will play on repeat so much that you'll get tired of the discography again in 2 weeks? I love those guys, I'm a blink since their debut but it's fucking tiring not having a full album and not even 10 songs. That said, I'm really excited because we all know that the song will be lit, but for how much longer will we have to put up with this bullshit by YG?",1,405,83
Ah I see. Thanks. Looks like the Square xxx trend have finished. Was guessing it would be called Square Dance at one point.,1,123,23
Not enought. We need like 1.5M views per hour to beat Ari‚Äôs record.,1,67,13
The mini album will be named after the single.,1,46,9
"Holy..look at those retweets/likes, i know that most people don't care about it but for reference the DDDD teasers got about 55k~ retweets &amp; 85k-100k likes while the MV teaser currently has 95k retweets &amp; 147k likes...ALREADY this teaser has 100k retweets &amp; 147k likes...wow ",1,287,45
"Yes it's very good, can't stop looping these day",1,48,9
IKR?? I was like waiting forever but can't really believe when it's actually happening,1,86,14
They would get so much shit for doing that since LOONA just finished their Butterfly promotion.,1,95,16
Forever Young has weak choreo but it‚Äôs a very weak song as well imo,1,67,14
can we get like 1M views in 5minutes? üî•üî•üî•üî•,1,42,9
"Glad they didn‚Äôt post a moving teaser like last time, I would‚Äôve died ",1,70,13
HOLY FK YES,1,11,3
yeah probably this. ,1,20,3
"&gt;BLACKPINK‚Äôs new song is a song that is even more powerful than ‚ÄòDDU-DU DDU-DU‚Äô.

Same! This is exciting!!,1,24,4
"Awe, good for Jisoo! She deserves the attention. Her voice is beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è",1,75,13

vlive channel = free to watch channel+ = pay to watch. There are more exclusive contents.,1,89,16
They'll have teasers released almost every day concerning the album. The actual M/V teaser won't be released until 2 days or so before the M/V drops.,1,149,26
"channel + is the premium channel which has more exclusive content, the BP members sometimes only upload videos there for example. Overall BP doesn't do a lot of vlives anyway though, that is one part they could improve on for their promotions.",1,243,42
Update: I‚Äôve learned about vlive but what‚Äôs the difference between that channel and the channel+ thing,1,102,16
"It is a special platform where idols sometimes livestream and interact with their fans.   This is blackpink's channel there, a lot of it is things you might have seen on their youtube channel, but the videos which are livestreamed on that platform are exclusive there. Just have to go back to really old videos as well, there is a lot of content you haven't seen i can tell you that :D",1,385,71
Hol up. What the heck is a vlive,1,32,8
"I woke up to this which is such pleasant surprise! üëå I wonder what's the mini will be called, assuming this is the single track title. ",1,135,26
"CF = Commercial Film They're referring to the Paradise City ad that they've been teasing. If you scroll through this sub's front page, you'll see the teasers they're talking about. So much teasing and hype for a lame minutes-long commercial lol.",1,245,41
im so so happy this is also my first comeback i feel like crying. never knew it could be this crazy i cant imagine how the girls are feeling AAAAHHH!!! ,1,152,30
So much same! ,1,14,3
"There will be teasers almost daily in the next 2 weeks if it is anything like with square up! Pics of every girl like with Lisa here, song names of the EP, the cover for the EP versions, some music teasers and then at the end the mv teaser. Lot of exciting stuff! Hope you'll enjoy it, this is my 2nd ride now and i am just as excited if not more so now :D",1,356,75
Im so excited... when do you guys think the next teaser is gonna be dropped? This is gonna be my first comeback with them!!,1,123,24
OMG I'm shaking üò≤...April release lmao I feel sorry for the other groups making comebacks this month.,1,101,17
"Wait someone hit me in the face. Is this for real, i still can't believe it. April's gonna be a bloody battle. This is going to be comeback of the year.",1,152,31
"The Bold Type! It‚Äôs when one of the characters is going to meet with a guy, and she grabs sexy underwear and then Whistle starts playing. Iconic. ",1,146,27
My thoughts exactly. I'm like do I really need to come at you with all the stats from the rep tour? Haha.,1,105,22
"ExüÖ±Ô∏èlain pls, what is CF?",1,25,5
"This will be my first comeback too, can't wait for it :D",1,56,12
Do you remember what on TV. I remember hearing it on some ad or tv show and years passes and then I got into them and heard whistle and had the biggest case of d√©j√† vu bc I was like dang iv heard this before. Lemme know if you remember ,1,236,50
"Okay, a very smart move by YG to release the teaser material before the stock exchange market starts in the morning, so the stock price is skyrocketing now lol I think we could expect similar teaser material to be released around these times in the future ",1,256,46
I guess you're right. At least it won't be as late as EXO's comeback last year which literally took SM forever. I hope that it'll be another bop. It's going to be another bop. Gosh!!! I can't wait!!! I'm crying right now. Urghhh üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,1,234,44
That‚Äôs one hell of a way to celebrate,1,37,8
I. DECLARE. COMEBACK.,1,21,3
"Okay after seeing this I am NOT ready for Rosie's teaser. Just dig my ditch already, fam. ",1,90,17
We gotta spread the love and the hype,1,37,8
I called the chief and he said that platinum blonde *is* in fact **it**.,1,72,14
Yep 2nd time here as well. Still just as excited for this one though! From this teaser alone I can tell it's going to go hard. This won't a JYP scenario where we get 'bad bitch' teasers but a soft song. BP is officially coming for the throat with this.,1,252,50
omg I totally forgot abt the forever young vid,1,46,9
Prepare to not be able to sleep at all the night before it releases. My body willed itself awake at like 4:30 to watch Ddu-du Ddu-du when it dropped.,1,149,29
"We're in the end game now Blinks, i can't believe we're all here for this. So damn exciting, you can already feel it's such a strong concept. Holy shit was worried this day would ever arrive but here we are. Kill this love, kill this comeback, kill the competition until there's nothing left. ",1,293,53
"Thank you! That's encouraging. The translation I read also said 4 nights in a row (like the above comment), but sometimes browser translations are quite faulty, so I appreciate when someone posts a better one. That translation (staying up all night) is possibly just wrong.",1,273,45
Still a bit later than the schedule but thanks for that I can finally witness BP's comeback,1,91,17
"I was so worried they'll be releasing the song this coming weekend, didn't know how will I sneak watching the comeback in the middle of my wedding lol. Thank god it got moved, my life will be back to normal by April 5th and I can focus all my energies on my babies' awesomeness&lt;3",1,282,54
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG THIS IS REALLY HAPPENInG EYE SJKSFSGDKL I CAN'T WAIT HOLY SHIT THIS IS MY FIRST COMEBACK ,1,117,17
"Because leaks never happen, right?",1,34,5
"Me too, I first heard of blackpink when i was eating at a korean fried chicken restaurant and they were playing whistle lol",1,123,23
I CANT HANDLE IT. OH GOD I AM READYYYYY!,1,40,9
I am shooketh,1,13,3
"Not legit, I just whet in the Korean keyboard And hit random buttons ",1,69,13
It‚Äôs a J O K E,1,14,6
"If this is legit, we got ourselves a breakup anthem. ",1,53,10
This is my first official comeback since I truly got into Blackpink right after the release of DDDD... and I'm just so overwhelmingly happy! I can't wait to see all the hard work the girls have put into this album and music video for us blinks! ,1,245,46
IT HAPPENINGGGGG. HER HAIR IS BROWWWWWWWWWNNNNN. I wished it was 3/29 but a week isn't too bad :'''''))))) YAYYYY,1,113,19
At least it's not a single. An EP is fine if they release two EPs this year imo.,1,80,18
we‚Äôve known this for months ,1,28,5
"My first comeback as a Blink. Got into BP in October of last year and never look back. I have a feeling the song, as well as the entire EP, is going to blow everybody away and set the industry ablaze. ",1,201,41
I CANT,1,6,2
? Where'd you get this from?,1,28,6
Omg so jealous!! Where are you from?,1,36,7
I'M EXCITED WITH YOU!!!! ,1,25,4
"Me too! By the way, I should have seen your name on ptt before, good to see you here !",1,86,20
"Me too. I've said it before but just got into K-pop in November/December last year, and it's because of BP. They are the first concert I'll ever attend in my life. And I'm constantly keeping up with information and I've never done that with any celebrities before. Now, with all this happening, I didn't know I was going to feel those amount of emotion!",1,353,64
The linked translation says their 4th day of filming not anything about staying up 4 days in a row. So... Idk.,1,110,21
Ohhhh that would make me feel better!! That makes sense.,1,56,10
Can we beat Ari‚Äôs record for most views in yt within 24hrs? CAN WE? CAN WE? ,1,76,16

Shazam comes out April 4th here in Manila so we get both worlds. üî•üî•üî•,1,68,14
"I mean i totally understand that we want it as soon as possible, but we also want it to be as successful as it can be right, and for that to happen about two weeks of promotion and teasers is the best situation. It allows people to spread the word, it allows people to preorder the EP, it's just good business. We waited 9 months already, a few more days won't matter :D",1,370,73
"Well tbf, none was as bad as the long one between AIYL and DDDD :D ",1,67,15
"I knew of kpop before because i am a fan of starcraft and korean players are the best there (and kpop acts sometimes performed at events), but it wasn't until i first saw the video of blackpink performing a medley of their songs at JYP's party people that i actually cared for anything kpop. I only saw that video also because a friend of mine was into twice and he showed me this BP performance rather randomly. It instantly catched my interest, especially ""whistle"" was just so catchy and it actually wowed me, which is funny because i am a big metal fan and that's rather far away from kpop :D ANYWAY, long story short, BP made me to a kpop fan and there probably won't ever be a group which i like more in this scene. It might be an insane reaction, but i got teary eyes when i heard DDDD, all suppressed emotions i had during the long wait, all the doubts if that comeback will be what i hoped it to be, everything culminated in that moment and just made me happy. Sorry for writing this novel, but that's how it is/was :D",1,1027,196
"Haha, I went thru multiple droughts. :(",1,39,7
99% certain it won't happen,1,27,5
It's out officially in my region. Guess I'm lucky over here lol. Great movie you're going to love it.,1,101,19
Why?!!! I honestly prefer it to be released by the end of march because I really can't wait already!!! I think it's going to be another bop. Urghhh. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ I can't...,1,168,31
The superhero movie,1,19,3
Shazam is already out what do you mean? ,1,40,8
"Same! I got into them because I heard Whistle on an American tv show. AITYL had just come out. I was around for the d4 comeback, so this is my second one ü•∞",1,155,33
Thanks. ‚úçÔ∏è ‚úîÔ∏è,1,13,3
"Reading all of these posts which say that it will be their first comeback makes me so happy, first because i know how amazing it is to experience this for the first time (and even now the 2nd time for me, it might be even better lol), but also because it just shows how much they have grown, having all these new fans &lt;3 Enjoy the ride! PS: That would be a great scene for the mv!",1,383,77
Yes exactly! I hope they stay healthy and good!,1,47,9
"Hahaha same!! I'm so excited, I'm just going through &amp; reading everyone else's excitement &amp; upvoting left &amp; right &amp; can't stop smiling!! :D",1,155,24
Wait....but Shazam! comes out on April 5 too. I can‚Äôt take that much excitement in one day!!,1,92,17
I've been really feeling that there will be a shot in the MV where all 4 members will walk up to the camera and hit it away a la Beyonce in Lemonade. I'M SO INTO THIS LOOK ON LISA TOO. LITERALLY I'M SO STOKED. Didn't get to be in on BLACKPINK until after D4 so just like a lot of you guys it'll be my first comeback!!!!!,1,320,67
"Nah we not about to do this. Swifties literally weren‚Äôt even trying to win this award, we were going for Best Song, and we had the votes for it, but still lost for whatever reason. Taylor winning this award instead was shocking to us, too. Don‚Äôt come for Taylor when she literally just finished the highest grossing tour by a female artist this decade. Come for the KCA‚Äôs, they‚Äôve aways been known to fix these things.",1,418,76
"AHHHHHHHH I am sooo sooo sooo super excited!!! This is what makes it real for me. A name &amp; a date!! And a badass teaser. Lisa looks awesome!! I'm loving the aesthetic. The details about the song so far and this teaser have me expecting a great banger of a song. Slay me, BLACKPINK! &lt;3",1,291,55
"I literally got into kpop because of blackpink, they will always be my favorite group. That was a little after AIIYL got released, so i was a blink during the biggest drought, hehe. Did you still get that excited during DDDD (especially because of that long wait)? Like i just got chills and everything when i first listened to DDDD and saw the mv, pure joy.",1,358,66
"&gt; BLACKPINK are currently filming their mv, have stayed up all night for four days I hope this isn't literal :( I know music video shoots can be strenuous, but that sounds extreme! I want a comeback, but I want the members to be healthy more &lt;3",1,250,47
Hey! On  the votes are hidden for 60 minutes I believe.,1,55,11
I jumped around in my room alone if that makes you feel better lol ,1,67,14
"Yes. Depending on where you live, April 4th ",1,44,8
I hope the girls get some rest for the next week!! They will need it üíï,1,70,16
"I think the confusion was that they would ANNOUNCE the comeback before March ends but articles were written as if it would release before March ends. In YGs leaked financial report, it did say BP comeback would be the first week of April. ",1,239,43
KILLING ME ,1,11,2
"Just enjoy the ride! There will be a lot more teasers coming in the next ~2 weeks, including some sound snippets for their songs (at least if it is similar to the square up teaser phase). It should be a hobby first and foremost, it will be great!",1,246,48
Jisoo said so...back on March 10.,1,33,6
"omg, Lisa is so pretty in this picture (of course I believe she is also pretty overall). I'm trying to avoid burnout because my excitement level is so high for so long.",1,168,32
"Just don't engage fanwars is my best advice, it doesn't do any good and it saves you energy!",1,92,18
Boombayah era? she looks more badass with shorter hair,1,54,9
fan signings on US please,1,25,5
Thank you for the heads up. It's my first comeback also. My excitement is so hight that sometimes I have to walk away from everything Internet just to clear my mind. ,1,166,31
like ‚Äúyoure a full of shit Blink‚Äù when they drag BP‚Äôs name in a IZ ONE post and I responded like why drag YG‚Äôs name or even indirectly drag BP in a IZ ONE tracklist post. Saying YG is shaking for the 8 song tracklist as an EP.,1,226,48
Lisa dance break! Lisa dance break! ,1,36,6
Where'd you get that idea?,1,26,5
"I believe it's most likely April 5, at first YG said they're aiming for a late March comeback, and then the most recent announcement was that they're filming the comeback MV but no solid date is announced yet",1,208,38
I would prefer some variety :D One ballad would be nice for once. But yeah the title track should be some hardcore hip hop song for sure üî•üî•üî•,1,140,28
"Maybe they had to do some re-shoots, or maybe film some additional stuff? ",1,74,13
"In what way? :D I don't really visit that sub anymore, the mods are terrible and the atmosphere is rather anti BP in general :/",1,127,25
I wasn‚Äôt around for the last one either. Does this mean MV &amp; album get dropped on the 5th?,1,94,19
please 6-8 harcore hiphop song. that will kill me!! üî•üî•üî•,1,55,10
IZ ONE and Twice fans are shaking on kpop sub,1,45,10
COMEBACK TIME BABY!! IVE LITERALLY NEVER BEEN THIS HYPE BEFORE MY GIRLS ARE GONNA DROP SOLID GOLD üñ§üíóüî™üíî,1,102,18
THEY FUCKING DID IT,1,19,4
"There was mixed information going around, in one it said it will be at the end of march, the other said either that or early april. I like this date more because there is a little more time to build hype, allow for album preorders, etc. So yes this should mean that the music video will be released on the 5th as well",1,317,63
I just plan on not sleeping lmao ,1,33,7
"Wait, I'm confused. YG said their comeback was supposed to be by the end of March but it says here that it'll be on April 5th. Does that mean that their only their album will come out on April 5th or does that mean that their music video is going to come out on April 5th too? ",1,277,57
Filming mv? I thought it is already done?,1,41,8
Lisa is just so damn beautiful!,1,31,6
April 5th confirmed,1,19,3
BTS on April 12. but oh well its still BP focus with Coachella and North America promotions get it UMG,1,102,20
Wait that is a thing? Oh wow this will be insane,1,48,11
"Ofc they would hype this up, but man if they really will publish something which transcends DDDD in its intensity i will actually die. I remember when i first saw DDDD, how emotional that was and how blown away i was, especially due to the rap verses. (but also the bridges, everything really). If they manage to do it again, this time with maybe a chorus which hits a little harder still, then i am done for good :D I am ready, i am prepared and i will still have the most insane emotional reaction when i first hear the song, lord have mercy!",1,544,104
That sounds great üòç I‚Äôm so excited ü§ó,1,36,8
This is so cute lol ^_^,1,23,6
now stream DDDD to a billion views!,1,35,7

Nice haha I regret stanning them late lmao ,1,43,8
I guess I can be considered an old timer since this is the 4th one for me.,1,74,17
"*holy fuck*, it's actually happening. HYPE",1,42,6
I know this feeling! One can get really emotional with one's favorite group :) ,1,79,14
"One of my favorite clips of Ros√© hehe, they did so well! The vlive in general was so fun because one could tell how excited they were about it as well :) But pls try to finish your work hehe, we will most likely get a teaser almost every day now. Different pics of every girl, some teasers for the songs, how many there will be on the EP, etc. Lot of hype generation, don't use all your energy just yet :D",1,405,82

yo close the books on April 4. lol! üòÇ,1,37,9

LOL omg wish I could do that. üòÇ I have month end so we‚Äôre working on closing the books definitely not an option for me haha. ,1,125,26

i might skip work for this! lol,1,31,7
"They SHOULD do one, that happened with DDDD at least and seems to be rather standard for comebacks! You might have seen this legendary clip from it:   They also tease the song there already, some music and footage of the video, i actually got chills back then :D",1,262,48
"They could do the bare minimum and we would still be excited about it, but with their Coachella perfromance coming... they *know* they have to go hard to blow the public away",1,174,32

"Nobody in my family listens to Kpop so I really just expressed my excitement to my dog, he understands FINALLY",1,110,20

"I feel like Oprah right now, AN UPVOTE FOR YOU, AND AN UPVOTE FOR YOU ",1,70,15
"bangkok april 10, then USA",1,26,5
"It also says """"Black Pink's new new song is a very intense song that goes beyond"" DDDD "". Will this be even more hardcore, damn :O Obviously they would always say things to hype it, but man it is working :D",1,206,41

"I already told another poster who said the same, be prepared for the comeback vlive they will most likely do about an hour before the mv drops, and also be prepared to get emotional :D Assuming you are already as far down the rabbit hole as i was when i experienced my first comeback with DDDD :D Anyway, enjoy!",1,311,59
I know right! I really can't wait oh my goddddd,1,47,10

"OH MY GOD I WAS JUST READING ABOUT THEIR COMEBACK ON THIS SUB AND DECIDED TO POP UP ON INSTAGRAM!! Guess what, the first thing that showed up was this photo teaser and I was SH00K ",1,180,36
"Depending on how deep you already are in the rabbot hole, prepare to get really emotional during the vlive they will most likely do right before the comeback, DDDD was my first comeback and it was amazing :D ",1,208,38
"Wow, She looks smoking hot with platinum blonde! We need more teasers ! ",1,72,13
"as soon as i got the notification ""@blackpinkofficial posted a photo"" i was like ""IS IT HAPPENING? IS IT FINALLY HAPPENING???"" and guys ITS HAPPENING! üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è",1,154,26
This is my first comeback I‚Äôve never felt this before. LETS GOO ,1,64,12
WE DID IT KIDS,1,14,4
I think my heart just exploded a little...,1,42,8

Are they all cutting their hair!????!!,1,38,6
YES YES YES YES YES ,1,20,5
OMG LISA LOOKS SO GOOD. I can‚Äôt believe it! My first comeback with BLACKPINK. üò± I thought I was getting clowned again after waiting a whole week. üòÇ Upvotes for everyone!!!,1,171,31
LISA IN PLATINUM BLONDE ,1,24,4
IT'S HAPPENING Even though I was waiting for it I still didn't expect it to actually happen.,1,92,17
I‚Äôm happy we finally have a date even if it‚Äôs later than we were told!! Also Lisa looks so good like wow,1,104,22
Finally we can stop pretending to care about that dumb CF. LISA I LOVE YOU,1,74,15

YALL I THOUGHT I WAS READY BUT I WASNT. WHAT A CONCEPT HOLT HELL ,1,65,14
WAS JUST ABOUT TO CLMMENT OMG IM SO EXCITED ,1,44,9
IT'S HAPPENING I'M SHAKING GUYS ,1,32,5
Absolutely stunning. üòç,1,22,3
Lol agree. I really don't see why anyone is upset by this. It's a kids award shows. No one actually takes this seriously? It means extremely little outside of the young audience that watches that channel.,1,204,36
"I mean, her tour and her album were massive, massive hits. I hated the album! As a longtime Swiftie, it was nothing I wanted to hear. But I can't pretend it's not relevant. It's OK, Blinks. No one needs to worry about that. It's a kid-centered award, voted for primarily online and the category was obviously more likely to be won by an American artist. Kids aren't exactly known for their understanding of global culture, for obvious reasons. If anything, Blinks should be happy to see BP was included! Any nod in an American award show setting, even one is low-key as kids choice, is a sign they are gaining popularity and interest in the U.S. :)",1,648,117
Miss Earth,1,10,2
shes so gorgeous omg. üñ§,1,23,5
fyi this is KIDS choice awards,1,30,6
The avocados xD,1,15,3
"hey miss world, you look so damn beautiful :&lt; ",1,49,9
"She‚Äôs so damn gorgeous and charming, it‚Äôs a joy to watch her üíï",1,62,13
Taylor Swift shouldn‚Äôt even fucking be on that list! ,1,53,9
"Oh my god, my heart can't take it anymore",1,41,9
Cause the kids choice awards matter? Lol ,1,41,7
"The show has stopped being relevant since the Disney ex-acts grew out of it, arguably the last generation of teen stars with actual star power. Their latest attempt to bring in ratings and social interactions by using K-pop artists have been something, still, its accolades are fading and people don‚Äôt really care about it anymore so y‚Äôall shouldn‚Äôt really bother raging at it lol",1,380,64
The votes were way off and even some Swifters voted for BLACKPINK to win. ,1,74,14
enjoy!!! keep us updated on how the soundcheck went,1,51,9
When is it though?! XD,1,22,5
wow how gobal... ,1,17,3
"We live in a digital music age where you have access to any song at the tip of your fingers. Back then you had no choice but to buy a full album just to listen to a few good songs you liked from the artist. Now no one has time for that anymore to listen to garbage filler music when there is so much new music out there released daily. Album sales in the west are dropping like a rock even from big name artists. Did you know Drake, one the biggest artists only had 330K album sales last year and that was the highest selling album for the year. Compare that in 2010 his first album had 1.8M albums sold. Kanye West had 156K album sales for ""Ye"". Most money is made from touring and guess what BP is making mad bank from arena concerts for this world tour. To sum it all up full albums aren't what it used to be and the investment in time to produce one can be wasted when the public forgets half the album and the sales are secondary to touring. Of course BP need more music for touring purposes but I would say mini albums are the right strategy for this ADD world and it allows more attention paid to the individual tracks.",1,1126,221
"Not to be rude or anything but I think the show would still be relevant due to the amount of kids watching their network. Regardless of BLACKPINK being a nominee, I still watched the show. I'm just trying to be unbiased as possible here.",1,237,44
"this is pretty feasible, since yg needs to push blackpink and really make full use of them now considering the state yge is in, because blackpink is currently their biggest potential money maker rn, and they need to do something with their stocks or else yge is gonna lose its investors fast",1,291,52
i thought the comeback was delayed when i read the first couple of words and i almost freaked out. -although at this point it'll probably be delayed- ,1,150,27
Your statement about how Taylor is irrelevant when clearly she's not says a lot lol. ,1,85,15
How am I upset? I said I was surprised.,1,39,9
She won because she's actually the opposite of irrelevant. Why are you getting so upset over a kids choice award....? ,1,118,20
There will be blood,1,19,4
The world still wants to keep taylor swift relevant huh...,1,58,10
"I really dislike when people hype a release a lot, it raises everyone's expectation and then even if the comeback is amazing, people won't be surprised and will go ""yeah well, it was expected"". ",1,194,34
They did win the voting but of course this shitty award show used BP for clout purposes and never intended for them to get the win.,1,131,26
This is an irrelevant show that nobody over the age of 14 watches. It was meaningless participating in the voting anyway.,1,121,21
That video of her... perfection. ,1,33,5
It's not like Taylor Swift was gonna attend.,1,44,8
"Should be, according to previous releases",1,41,6
Where can we see the final vote tally? I want to know how many votes BP got compares to Swift. ,1,95,20
Nickelodeon's PRODUCERS' Choice Awards,1,38,4
We'll finally have 10+ group songs.,1,35,6
"This comeback will be an EP, YG said they had 6-8 songs ready, but I doubt we will get 8, most likely six. YG said we'll get two group comebacks this year along with the rest of the solos. If everything goes to plan that's 15 songs this year, ( 6 for each EP + plus 3 solos). Even if the EP only has four like square up that's 11 songs. I guess is that the second comeback will also be an EP, and we'll get a full album in 2020. Which with YG track record will be exactly 10 songs, with one song possibly being a remix of an already released song or a sub unit.",1,561,117
They still have not released a date though :(,1,45,9
Thank youu! üòÅ,1,13,3
So I'm guessing we'll only get one music video?,1,47,9
"And also in terms of practical arrangements, BP should not be able to attend the KCA Awards Presenting Ceremony..... That's why BP is not the winner. I think we don't need to take this too seriously as after all it should be some social media hypes only",1,253,47
Agree. Those types of moves don't seem to translate well on American shows.,1,75,13
"American award show has a global category, but still allow they an American artist in the categoryü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Not surprised, a lot of these American award shows are clearly using kpop fans because they know how active they are on social media. Especially since it seems as though a lot of the top American artists seem reluctant to a perform and attend nowadays and ratings seem be slipping. The grammy kinda did the same thing with bts. Have any kpop groups won an award for their actual music in an American award shows? Every time I hear about these award they always put kpop groups in the social media categories. ",1,613,109
it looks amazing omg,1,20,4
"honestly, 4D blew up like a nuke. i‚Äôm extremely shocked they didn‚Äôt win",1,71,13
"okay fine u win! I'm a fan of both parties (which you could probably tell). I'm disappointed that BP didnt win :(, especially since 4DD was recent. Learned the dance in a day lol",1,178,34
Stay &gt; Ddu Du Ddu Du &gt; Playing with fire &gt; As if it's your last &gt; Boombayah . ,1,90,19
why do they have so many teasers just for a commercial though?,1,62,12
jennie is really becoming human chanel,1,38,6
who? &lt;‚Äî(exactly my point lol),1,32,5
lol TS7 says hi sis,1,19,5
"Honestly, Nickelodeon's using BP as clouts to make their show at least relevant. In fact, many are now mad, like as in the most angry. ",1,135,25
That's the meaning I took from it too,1,37,8
"i mean, it‚Äôs still global",1,25,5
"i hope the dance uses completely different moves from before. they seem to have certain moves (one member does one move, the other member a beat behind and so on, etc) so i hope we get new moves. im hyped for the comeback though üòä",1,230,45
"Yeah sure but what is the goal of a group to become super famous or to satisfy their fans make a lot of money? &gt; It's quality &gt; quantity I disagree. Just because you have fewer songs doesn't mean they are better it just means you have to put more effort into the few songs you have. I mean out of the last mini album only FY was genuinely good the rest were average Kpop songs, not bad but not exceptional in any way, and even then it's far off from how good As If It's Your Last was. A healthy balance between quantity and quality is needed. As it stands Blackpink is like the ""Apple"" or the ""Supreme"" of Kpop. &gt; It's just a different release strategy and apparently it's working for BP. Yeah, maybe but IMO it's anti consumer strategy. Starving out the fans, so they would definitely buy your album is wrong.",1,819,155
"Vote counts are meaningless on KCA. I had this discussion on another board several years ago when a TV show with the highest votes lost out to another one whose cast would be in attendance at KCA and was considered more photogenic and ratings boosting. Then it was discovered that in tiny letters in the end of show credits, there was a disclaimer saying that while votes would be taken into consideration, final awardees would be selected at the discretion of the KCA's producers. So it's all meaningless.",1,506,88
"The account you're referring to is ""jennie__style"" who had 80K followers. Her new account is now [@jrubystyle]( ",1,112,17
"Right? If the award is for a global/foreign artist, then the country the award is based in shouldn‚Äôt get an entry. ",1,115,21
"I don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs fair to have a North American artist on the ballot, but whatever I guess.",1,101,19
Why do you need teasers? You seem pretty hyped about it already. Looks like their plan is working. ,1,99,18
The math really doesn't make sense.,1,35,6
Didn't BP beat Taylor Swift by like 1 million votes lmao. What a rip off using Blinks to make the Award Show popular.,1,117,23
Say it louder for YG in the back. ,1,34,8
Right lol,1,9,2
The Square Up album wasn't on sale until 5 days after the M/V dropped so an album release doesn't have land at the same time as the M/V. Teasers didn't drop until 10 days before although this is flexible. The M/V will either drop on 29th or April 5th to coincide with a friday release.,1,285,55
such a surprise. the north american nominee wins the north american award ,1,74,12
"The mv teaser is usually the last one anyway no? IIRC the DDDD video was also shot like a week before the comeback, there were teasers for the songs still, with the moving posters. Or even just the design for the two EP versions, the number of songs, anything really. There not being anything yet when the EP should probably drop in like 6 days is weird no matter how you look at it. Why that is? I am not sure, but i would assume the scandals are part of it.",1,459,91
That makes a lot of sense. I was trying to figure it out and thought maybe there was a group just mass reporting them. ,1,119,24
"That's sad, that happened to the Kylie closet account, lost her page in August and just got it back a couple of days ago. I think paparazzi are copywriting their images, gigi Hadid had to delete her own pap photo from her Insta.",1,228,43
There was a popular Jennie Fashion account on Insta that was deleted by instagram about 3 times now. A lot of IG closet acc were archiving their posts in case they where deleted as well. ,1,187,35
I doubt it was the scandal. How you suppose they drop teasers when now they're just finished up shooting the M/V? YG said the album would most likely drop mid to late March which was just an estimate and it looks to fall in line with that.,1,239,47
Everything is already planned ahead of time in preproduction including how they want to edit it and the visual fx work. They just need the girls to present for the shoot. ,1,171,31
WE üëè NEED üëè TEASERS üëè,1,21,6
"Sure but who remembers all of TXT's songs where as BP Kpop fans know all of BP's songs. Quality &gt; Quantity, just a differen't strategy and it works for BP.",1,158,30
"Nah the original comment was implying something along the lines of ""ofc he thinks the comeback is good, he was the one who choreographed it"" to which I'm saying the quality of the music is separate, so even if he himself was involved with the dancing, he can still be wowed by the music aspect. ",1,295,55

Omg that would be perfect. 3/29 is my birthday :D,1,49,10

Jisoo solo is #1 on ITunes in the Philippines. ,1,47,9
Well dang. ,1,11,2
Ikr? They‚Äôre such a winey Willy ,1,32,6
"Well in the financial report YGE promised its shareholders that they want to focus on more comebacks than in the past, 2 per year at least. So that's a good sign! I doubt that we will get all 3 solos this year though, Ros√© will definitely happen though, the other 2 we will have to see. But it's possible. ",1,306,59
"Yeah I think YGE has tried to leave the announcement as late a possible hoping to limit any backlash over the scandal, it is a shame. I agree multiple smaller comebacks a year would be perfect. You never know YG may stick to his promise and by the end of the year we could see 2 comebacks and 3 solos. I know wishful thinking but I'm an optimist.",1,346,68
Well arent you just a negative Nancy. Lol have some faith. ,1,59,11
"Yeah i am slightly disappointed that the teaser run as you said won't be as hype as with square up. But at the same time i wouldn't necessarily blame YGE too much here, it was probably mostly due to the scandals, just bad luck really. Personally i hope we get at least 4 songs again, 6 would be perfect really. In general i would prefer multiple comebacks per year with lower song count over less with more songs per cb.",1,420,80
"Yeah, Kyle did D4 and Kiel did Forever Young",1,44,9
"I agree they haven't really given themselves time to build hype, having said that hype is at fever pitch amongst blinks. It doesn't look like we'll get anything close to the square up teaser run which is a little disappointing. If they are going to comeback on Friday that's 5 days to build some hype, that's under the assumption they announce it officially tomorrow. So thats album title and track list tomorrow, we won't get individual member teasers or maybe they will double up if we do, so that's Mon and Tues, m/v teaser wed or thurs and release on the Fri. Seems rather tight having said that though thats probably all they need but tbh for me if they announce there will be 6 songs on the EP I'll be more than hyped. ",1,725,134
Finally! We can enter the double digits in number of songs!,1,59,11
He helped with last comeback but I think Kyle Hanagami did DDDD. Kiel Tutin has worked closer with YG though as he has done stuff with X Academy and done stuff with Lisa.,1,170,33
He is one of their choreographers. He helped with DDDD but that was also Kyle's choreo. He was worked closely with YG and has done stuff for X Academy and done stuff with Lisa. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;,1,202,36
"Yes, but it‚Äôs not confirmed that he‚Äôs the choreographer for this comeback",1,73,12
is this the same choreographer as last time?,1,44,8
From every angle they're saying this comebacks going to be huge remember they even said the songs are awesome as well I can't freaking wait,1,139,25
Jisoo and Rosie‚Äôs solos are climbing up iTunes Charts in both songs and MV in Asia apparently. Our vocal line y‚Äôall. üòå,1,118,22
There‚Äôs about a week left in March. üò± Wonder if they will just drop the MV without teasers. üòÇ ,1,94,19
"Wow, YG really had to open his dungeon to save himself.",1,55,11
This means we're going to be getting the teasers and album preorder soon! FINALLY!!,1,83,14
I‚Äôm glad you got it ,1,20,5
"GUYS &amp; GALS, IT‚ÄôS HAPPENING",1,31,5

BRO ITS HAPPENING ,1,18,3
"I'm glad they're finally releasing a new single, or EP, presumably, but when do we get a full album? I mean how the hell do they program a proper arena concert without album filler? Get it together YG.",1,201,38
Need the teasers üòç,1,18,4
What do you think the name of this going to be?,1,47,11
Hey Reggie ,1,11,2
Choreographer has nothing to do with song quality though.,1,57,9
I hope he thinks it‚Äôs good bc he choreographed it lmao,1,54,11
BRO IS THIS HAPPENING,1,21,4
"Well i think it is definitely coming, too much evidence to not believe it imo. Ofc they could always still push it back theoretically, but other than that tiny chance i am convinced. I just want them to create a little more hype rather soon, with actual teasers. Articles which confirm it are one thing, having actual information about when it drops, seeing photos, etc is another alltogether.",1,393,68
sunny face,1,10,2
"I agree with this! I'm so, so, so excited for the comeback and for our girls and I have been for months, but I need something a little more concrete before I'm excited &amp; believing that it's actually coming *now*. There was talk in the fall of it being before the end of 2018; nope. YG said a while ago it would be mid (nope) to late March, but now that's less than week and we still have no date, name or teaser of any kind? It's not that I'm mad about that, I'm not. I just need something a *little* more real to anchor my hopes.",1,534,107
This really fit her well!,1,25,5
But someone who just picked up can someone who has experience doing it would be two different things.,1,101,18
These are some of the most incisive comments I have read these days. Thanks a lot.,1,82,16
So nothing this week? ,1,22,4
"After everything that's happened, they need to stick to their schedule or risk stocks falling further and even bigger investor push back.",1,137,22
Ready for impact,1,16,3
"I actually not mad at all with this, this helps my wallet a whole lot. Many of my ARMY friends were happy but also complaining what did their biases did to their bank account since too much releases and merchandises lololol",1,223,41
Hoping for some good news finally! Bring it on! I am guessing they will do digital release first and physical a week later as per usual. I hope the physical packaging and bonuses slays!,1,185,34
"As an army that's why I'm only a casual Blackpink fan. A group on the level of BP should release AT LEAST 10 song a year. Hell, TXT just debuted and it's probably going to pass BP in number of songs by the end of the year.",1,222,47
Imagine if YG had their shit together and Blackpink released new music every now and then. It‚Äôs sad we are so starved of new music and content. I‚Äôm really jelly of armys and the amount of content they get form bighit fpr bts. ,1,226,43
"I am thinking more about the album, give the fans some time to preorder it, spread the news so everyone knows, etc. There is a reason everyone in the entertainment industry does teasers, it helps a lot to get maximum return. Let's say they drop news on monday for a friday release (which is the last day in march it can realistically happen), that's not a lot of time to create maximum hype either, but i could live with it and it probably would suffice",1,453,85
"Personally, I kind of prefer it as a mystery. It adds to the excitement for me. I fully expect YGE to give teasers and a schedule, but can you imagine the buzz if the video would just release randomly this week? People would go crazy and it would be all of the news!",1,266,53
Finally üôå,1,9,2
can‚Äôt tell intentional or unintentional typo,1,44,6

"Yeah no problem, i just remembered it to be the case (but doublechecked to make sure) because i am interested in these kinds of statistics. They absolutely had! And i expect them to grow even more this year, if the US promotions are of quality it should be insane :)",1,266,50
"Awwwww, I think this is my favorite. ",1,37,7
BLACKPINK is the Revolution! I hope they will be the first female Kpop group to be awarded the Ruby Play Button (50 Million Subs),1,129,24
"Oh god, I guess my brain playing tricks on meüòë! I dont why i remember them having 5 mil if they had 7 when DDDD came out. Sorry for the misunderstandingü§ê Well at least we can agree on one thing, they had an amazing growth since DDDD and they are not slowing down. ",1,264,53
Blackpink in ypur area,1,22,4
"I really need them to drop an actual date, the name of the EP, the number of songs on the ep, actual teasers soon now. I am sure it will be a success no matter what, but give the fans a little bit of time to spread excitement :D",1,228,49
"You mean October 2017? Because then they had like 4M, around 7M right before the DDDD comeback in June 2018. ",1,109,20
YG expecting things as scheduled is already very miraculous to many people,1,74,12
RIP video editors,1,17,3
I also got into Blackpink and in fact K-pop in general back in October last year ü§ó Can‚Äôt wait for their comeback üòç Hopefully we get some teasers soon.,1,150,29
We dont have a title yet! Teasers should be out by tomorrow or Monday. We can have a 3/29 comeback. Im sweating rn. ,1,116,23
"I remember when I started getting into BP back in October, they had around 5 mil. And now 6 months later, they are at 20...just wowüòÅ. I am sure they will surpass 30 mill by the end of the year, considering they have a World Tour, a CB and will be at Coachella. ",1,261,53

"**‚ÄãBLACKPINK completed filming music video for upcoming comeback.** According to a report of YG's CEO Yang Min-seok, BLACKPINK has filmed the music video for their new title track. Yang Min-seok: ""BLACKPINK, who has already filmed the music video, is expected to make a comeback at the end of March as scheduled."" However, YG hasn't confirmed the exact date yet. Yesterday, Jisoo posted a video in the YG dance practice room with a new hair color on her Instagram stories. It looks she has dyed her hair red. Jisoo said: ""We're practicing! Wait for us, everyone"" Stay tuned for updates as more photos/videos of BLACKPINK's upcoming comeback. (I saw that some people were having concerns about the music video, because they thought YG has rushed the music video. YG has definitely had plans for this music video for months already, so they just had to film everything this week. I think we can expect a high-quality music video. Also, the date of release is debatable. YG has definitely planned a whole comeback promotions schedule a few months ago and if they postpone the date, BLACKPINK's complete schedule gets messed up, so there is a chance that the comeback is still in March. If they postpone the release date BLACKPINK is to join BTS and TWICE in April with their comeback. Most companies avoid these things.)   ***** *I am a bot that transcribes allkpop articles.*",1,1373,233

"The CF is really well made. And as usual, this fandom makes us (sensible Blinks) look dumb. How are you going on their page complaining that Jennie is getting more spotlight? I swear, some Blinks would rather have the girls do nothing, and be EQUALLY JOBLESS, then having one of them shine just a bit more than the other. If a company decides they want one of the members to appear more, there is nothing that whining is going to get you. You make them look stupid, and you make us look stupid. On top of that, y'all just look petty. Why are you complaining? Same thing with Sprite. People got really in their feelings when it was leaked they wanted Jennie alone, but YGE insisted on the group. I thought i left the pettyness with my other fandom (Blackjacks), but y'all are on a whole another level. The fandom is completely fractured and it's less than 3 years, can you imagine the bigger this group gets? It's going to be a battle royale. ",1,942,174
"ah, i think you mean the VIP package with the after show send off stuff? thats a good question. i think closer to the day there will be some more info. i know at the forum sometimes for VIPS there is actually a separate entrance/parking and a dedicated liaison for the group.",1,275,52

I get the feeling each member will have their own ‚Äústory‚Äù within the full CF and each have their own cut to highlight their part. ,1,130,25
"Haha, to be fair I'm pretty new to KPop and this is my first BP CB. Had no idea they did teasers for commercials.",1,113,24
Yes I'm learning it too! I think it's one of the easier choreography,1,68,13
"I read conflicting news and as far as i am aware no direct news from YGE at all. Both times it was a YG insider, one said it could be early april latest. Anyway, it should happen soon, even if that means +/- a few days.",1,219,46
YG himself said it was the end of this month. I wouldnt worry. MV was shot this week. Will probably drop next week with the EP,1,126,26
"I think it is important to try and push everyone in the community to be as reasonable as possible, as we all know the kpop crowd can be rather naive and impulsive, moreso on other social media ofc but even on reddit sometimes. Ah interesting, underscores were needed (and i like them at this point :D), anyway thanks a lot! (don't get me started on the cf talk hehe)",1,366,69
"I bet the come out this weekend, at least by Monday/Tuesday.",1,60,11
"Might maybe be early april and not end of march, i could see that. But even then, teasers and actual dates should be out soon!",1,126,25
"Being an idol is also different from being an independant musician, that is something people sometimes forget. Ofc they want to make music, but as far as we know noone of them composes, so that is also something to consider. And as i said, they actually got a pretty huge world tour, something ros√© for example really focused on in their us interview as well, seeing the happy fans makes them happy, performing music is what they live for. The financial reports suggested that there should be 2 comebacks per year from now on as well, so that is good.",1,551,100
"In this day of music piracy, it's usually only through live shows and merchandising for them to make any money at all. I can't really fault any musician for shilling in this new age we live in.",1,193,37
Definitely! As there are only 9 more days to go I am really on the edge of my seat üò≠,1,84,20
No problem! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,1,14,3
"Great :) Anyway, sorry again if it was too harsh, but sometimes being direct might be ok as well. Let's just hope that the comeback teasers will be out the next few days, it really is about time :D",1,197,39
"I‚Äôve been that way today, especially with all the CF talk so I get it! I actually mentioned you in a thread awhile back about how you are our own little keyboard warrior (in a good way) and someone else agreed with me! I couldn‚Äôt find a way to tag you though because of the underscores in your name. ",1,300,59

"It is interesting that i seem to have that reputation, at least with you, hehe. I probably could phrase things a little less aggressive as well, but yeah as i explained in another comment, sometimes it is just that the general atmosphere gets to me so i might be a little too direct. Anyway, thanks for saying it is more or less fine or even required sometimes! :)",1,364,68
"Np I understand, and your other detailed comment took the sting off a little :)",1,79,15
"Totally agree with you and I'd rather have them actually have work rather than nothing at all, kinda like when they had their year long hiatus. I'm always happy to know that they have something to do, even if it's not what people want from them which isn't their fault to begin with. We all know how yg is with releasing music.",1,327,62
Thanks! This comment definitely explains better what you were saying. :),1,72,11
"Yeah i am sorry for that, it is not against you in particular either, it is just that i see similar comments a lot and at that point i argue against the general atmosphere which is oftentimes really negative and also entitled. ",1,227,42
Translation? And thanks for link ,1,33,5
"I am also sorry if i come across as condescending, but as i said it is a really bad timing to say this hehe :D Also it is just the hotel teasing the cf, why the comeback teasers are not out yet is anyone's guess but it seems rather confirmed that it will happen for sure. Also don't forget the world tour they are on, that is literally what most artists live for, performing music in front of their fans. If we look at BP's history i can understand your comment, we don't have much music for how long they are already a group, they didn't do tours either really. But yeah especially this year we really cannot complain so far i think, and if the financial report taught us anything YG really wants to go through with like 2 comebacks per year in general. Which seems fine imo, even if fans obviously always want more.",1,817,156
"When an article like [this](  drops it‚Äôs concrete, the comeback is happening. ",1,78,12
It kinda does. It was a little mean. Mods can delete this thread as clearly everyone has really strong feelings about what I said...,1,132,24
"Nah you‚Äôre good. Sometimes tough love it needed. You‚Äôre that friend that is like ‚Äúbro no‚Äù and then we go ‚Äúshit, you‚Äôre right‚Äù ",1,126,23
"Is that so? I try to, which might come across as condescending sometimes though :/",1,82,15
They shot their comeback music video this week. They're dropping nee music before the month ends. Not to mention they're on a world tour and preparing for Coachella. ,1,166,28
Viper spitting truth as always. ,1,32,5
Sorry. Just that the paradise city hype has me kinda heated. They‚Äôre teasing CFs now instead of MVs?? Like cmon I understand they‚Äôre coming back relatively ‚Äúsoon‚Äù but I will hold my reservations until I see a real teaser. For now it‚Äôs just been promises and nothing concrete.,1,275,48
"Agreed! I know all artists have CFs and make revenue from it, but like you said, they just don‚Äôt release music as often as other groups!",1,136,26
every idol group is made to hopefully take in revenue from CFs - just looks at Red Velvet Irene... she is everywhere (on yogurt cups etc) the only difference is that we have a mismanaged company that won‚Äôt release music as often as other groups. ,1,246,45
"They are on a world tour and are coming back rather soon, one of the absolute worst times to complain about something like this quite honestly. Literally only making this post because there were news about cfs recently, i mean cmon... Sorry for being harsh but sometimes i just don't understand certain complaints",1,313,53
Didn‚Äôt the leaked YG projections for the year show that they‚Äôve slated BlackPink‚Äôs comeback for April? I know they keep saying ‚ÄúMarch‚Äù but it‚Äôs already end of March and we have nothing. I‚Äôm confident they‚Äôll end up delaying until April like their internal notices say... ,1,271,45
"I‚Äôm a Jennie bias but I‚Äôm happy if any of the BP members get screen time, because I like all of them. To bash Jennie over a stupid reason like this commercial is stupid af.",1,172,35
Yesss do it!! I learned it recently and I don‚Äôt know how to dance. I recommend Savage Angels tutorials on YouTube. She explains the moves instead of just showing a slowed down mirror. ,1,184,33
The fandom is so starved for BP content they we are literally fighting over how many seconds our biases are getting in a stupid CF. Ugh. I hope YG just releases real content soon for their comeback or I think our fandom is going to have a blood thirsty war LOL,1,260,51
Does ROS√â have her own IG account that‚Äôs not fan made?,1,54,11
sure &amp;#x200B;,1,17,2
"Np :) And yes, it's great! ",1,27,6
What's even more fucked up is that they probably did write some of the lyrics in their songs but weren't given the credit they deserved...jennie said she helped write some of the lyrics to stay but where's her name? I wouldn't b surprised if this came out 2b true considering how women are treated in the music industry there (not that this only happens in SK),1,360,66
Looks normal to me for the typical Japanese bluray/dvd of concerts. It‚Äôs pretty much 100$ before shipping from HMV and other places. Japanese media tends to be much more expensive than Korea/Taiwan versions.,1,207,33
Whoa is $120 the correct price??? I wanted to buy one but really pricey,1,71,14
Also the crescent moon emojis around the same time as those blue butterflies as well.,1,85,15

"If said girls aren't Blackpink, I'm asking for my money back! ",1,62,11
"ok cool! I got that. now the question is, how will they know if its VIP? Will is show up when they scan it?",1,107,24
Oh great... I'm going to fit right in as a 30-something male fan at the Atlanta show... ,1,88,17
"The price isn‚Äôt really suspicious, tons of scalpers bought tickets and are now trying to sell them because the demand isn‚Äôt as high as they thought for some venues. There‚Äôs a really small chance is might be fake but Stubhub provides a guarantee that they will refund you if that‚Äôs the case. There‚Äôs no way to 100% verify until you get to the venue. Stubhub says you should try to call them at the venue if the the ticket doesn‚Äôt work. They will refund you worst case scenario. For 100% security you‚Äôd have to buy resale from ticketmaster themselves as they are the ones that have sold the ticket so they are the only ones that can confirm with certainty.",1,654,120
Jennie and Lisa on black side. Rose and Jisoo on pink side. üñ§üíñ,1,62,13
"So I shouldn‚Äôt be suspicious of the below face balue of the tickets. I have my eyes for ga at $140 each, Im assuming it‚Äôs because no one was buying them at the already ridiculous face value. Also is their any way to verify if their legit once I have them?",1,255,51
"Agreed. She has diverse talents, and is such a great performer. I mean, her on stage persona is just fire. Never disappoints.",1,125,22
Just watched all the new live videos on Apple Music and screamed at least a dozen times. Ros√© on Last Christmas is instantly iconic. ,1,133,24
Thank you for your legit and accurate opinions!,1,47,8
"To be fair, Jennie is a lot higher on the Brand Reputation Ranking than the other members. I say this as someone who isn't a Jennie bias too (so please don't come at me.) When companies look at who they want to represent their brand, they take into account the person's reach, how many people know them, how many people respond to them, and buying trends following that person's involvement with other products. Jennie has been ranking #1 since around her solo debut, with the other members a bit further down the list. In Korea, she is the most recognized of the members, so that is who companies are most likely to use to promote their products. I think it is a coup for the group that the company decided to use all of them tbh. It has to be far more expensive for all four than just one, but I think that as it is a hotel chain they recognize the other members' value in terms of international draw, as a lot of their clientele will be travelling from other countries. I don't reflect the ideas of this company btw, I think all the girls deserve equal spotlight, but it is likely the reason why Jennie is the ""main"" character in the commercial this time around.",1,1165,217
"someone might do a cam on periscope or something, but you could always buy the dvds? they just released a kyocera dome bluray also ",1,131,24

"From Paradise City's perspective, it was a brilliant move. Every teaser was basically it's own commercial and pretty much had all of us thinking about Paradise City for weeks. Too bad we're too poor to stay at their hotel so the jokes on them!! Muahahahaha!!! ... \*starts to cry\*",1,281,49

"With the integration of social media into culture, it has become a culture of extreme reactions and lack of accountability for actions and words. ‚ÄúToxic‚Äù is a good description. ",1,177,29
Comeback in Kpop doesn't have quite the same meaning it does in Western media. In the West it implies that the group or artist has fallen behind or taken a hiatus and are making a comeback. In Kpop it just means a group is releasing new music. It doesn't carry the negative connotation that the Western usage of the word may carry.,1,331,62
Yes!!! Exactly!!! They have a high potential! And I look forward to hearing their own songs!!!!,1,95,16
"they just could not understand that each character they represent has it's own story and it should be evident by the time the full video is dropped. by then, they should realize (or not because they're still sulking over that petty screen time) that the sum is greater than its parts.",1,284,51
"Jennie, you‚Äôre killing me ",1,26,4
"I misunderstood your intention, I‚Äôm sorry! Im just irritated because it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve seen since the Jisoo trailer dropped, lol. Agreed. Blonks should create their own subreddit, honestly. Get that negatively out of here. ",1,219,34
"At first I didn't believe that there were so many young blinks, but after I read some statistical analysis of blinks from some news these days, I am quite surprised and the high proportion of female fans shocked me. I thought male blinks should be of majority because BP is a girl group.",1,287,53
She's beautiful,1,15,2
Smoking hot,1,11,2
"as long as they're being promoted as a group, as what they advertised, screen time isn't an issue for me. just poking fun at those blonks really. lmao.",1,151,28
I think it‚Äôs because a lot of the fandom is younger. 14- 18 years old ,1,70,15
Oh honey ,1,9,2
God I missed RedSoo,1,19,4
Lmao this again. I honestly don‚Äôt give a shit how much exposure time they got in that leaked unofficial video. I‚Äôm not going to embarrass myself and BLACKPINK like the rest of stan twitter and stan insta because my bias didn‚Äôt ‚Äúget enough screen time‚Äù. It‚Äôs pathetic. I‚Äôm going to support them by living for the content and listening to their bops. Ros√© doesn‚Äôt need more time if a CF to prove she‚Äôs worthy in the group. ,1,421,77
not to mention that recent moment she sang in her instagram story with that hilarious filter. üòÇ,1,95,17
you really could have enough from that ~1sec exposure in the teaser video eh?,1,77,14
I‚Äôm all for Rosie content. Especially her on a carousel? Yes please. ,1,69,12
"Yeah, sadly this is really common in this fandom. I don't really see them in other fandoms",1,90,17

I thought all this was for the CB. o_O,1,38,9
"Of the 60 second clip that was posted this morning, Rosie was only in it for 2 seconds. Even the deer had more screen time lmao. Not expecting too much for the teaser or the 4 minute version anymore. ",1,200,39

you know i never hear ‚Äúoh irene got a cf instead of yeri..let‚Äôs hate on her‚Äù ot1 stan‚Äôs need to check themselves ,1,113,22

Was sort of hoping to hear Axl Rose.....,1,40,8
WOW!!! üòç,1,8,2
Exactly. You can say that again.,1,32,6
Yeah it's foolish of them to have so many teasers for a 60 sec commercial.,1,74,15
"They shouldn't have dropped so many teasers, photos and clips, for just a commercial. All the hype and time spent for these teasers is too much for jobless Blinks to not nitpicking everything. Just drop the whole thing and get it over with. I'm still waiting for the CB teaser that should be dropped instead of this. ",1,317,57
I don't think they will stop using BP but these shouts are just ... too shameful,1,80,16
"Omg I'm seeing so many comments bashing Jennie, it's shocking and disappointing. These are comments with literally hundreds of likes calling her selfish, spoilt, lazy, bratty etc, when it's not even her fault she got more screentime or whatever. I didn't release there were so many people INSIDE the fandom that hate Jennie with passion, yikes. It sucks going through the people who liked such vile comments and seeing they are all blink (usually lisa akgaes) accounts. The whole thing is childish and immature. ",1,512,84
"Which is so immature. That‚Äôs literally the concept of this CF, a girl from the past walking into a fantasy and hanging out with each girl. Blinks are so quick to judge and ruin things for BLACKPINK. Imagine being a company, see this stupid backlash over nothing and deciding not to use BP. Also, how embarrassing for the girls to have to see their fans act like this. ",1,368,68
"I feel like it'll still be Jennie-centric since she seems the only one who's wandering around the ""Paradise City"" and the solo stans will be even angrier.",1,154,27
That makes sense,1,16,3
Yes I agree but I still hope that they will edit it. This is getting annoying,1,77,16
They‚Äôre getting a lot of backslash on Instagram and twitter and that eskimo dude said that the actual CF is 4 minutes long so they better make something out of it ,1,163,31
"Y‚Äôall need to chill. Andrew Oh just updated saying this video is not the full video, and the real one is 4 minutes long. That clip was probably one of the many cuts they will run on television. ",1,194,38
"And in fact only Jennie is really engaging in the plot here as shown, while the others.... I hope they will edit it. ",1,117,23
"Not to be controversial, but they should have filmed a CF with just Jennie. I would be super happy for Jen if it was just her getting the gig, but it‚Äôs a group ad &amp; Jisoo, Ros√© and Lisa look like secondary characters, literally Jennie and the girls. Man, idk, I‚Äôm a bit upset by this ",1,288,56
"This advert isn't really for Blinks, It's going to be shown on TV and other places to attract customers to the resort. Some of these Blinks feel so entitled to how a company needs to run it's ad campaign.",1,204,39

Good to know!! Thank you!!,1,26,5
Yes! It's so annoying all this kids bashing on Jennie or any of the members because their bias didn't get same screen time I mean come on why do they even call themselves BLINK if they only support one member... ü§®,1,213,41
"Lol good observation though. Exactly, it is really funny lol",1,60,10
I think the official Paradise City YouTube leaked it ([link](  but immediately deleted. They should be editing it now,1,117,19

"Now they're attacking that eskimo guy, it's so childish. Obviously it's a commercial that follows a narrative structure so they can't just randomly show all the girls equally.

yea still not there :( ,1,23,5
Are you using the link? I suggest you open up your Spotify player and go to BP page.,1,84,18
They were allowed at the G-Dragon Sydney show but it's best to see if the venue post anything beforehand as Qudos can be pretty strict! Worst case scenario you'll have to cloak it which is free at the venue.,1,207,39
"oh, true. I mean I'm not sure. But that could be it. ",1,53,12
not showing up for United States? ,1,34,6

You can do it! Here's a good breakdown of the dance: [ ,1,55,12
A mix of both because they do both a black and pink concept well and it'd be nice seeing them do both in a single album (mini-album),1,132,27
I already love the vibes this is giving off lol,1,47,10
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD!! It feels like I've been waiting for ages for her solo lol,1,78,16

Anyone want 2 tickets to this show? Pls PM trying to get rid of tickets! ,1,73,15
jfc how much can you be expected to be hyped for a damn commercial... ,1,70,14
What is this a solo debut or something?,1,39,8
Just some info: I emailed YesAsia and asked them about this (because I was also considering buying there) and they told me they don‚Äôt get it in stock. I also asked a local kpop store near me and they told me that this item is not allowed to be sold outside of Japan unless you are a registered Japanese seller so I guess that‚Äôs the reason why many stores don‚Äôt get this in stock. Luckily my local kpop store is registered as a Japanese seller and gets some in stock üòä,1,467,91

"I think people missed the point of the video. It's an inception concept, dream sequence, where reality becomes fantasy. I think 1/2 the owners of the comments are too young to remember Inception. Oh well.",1,204,35
She looks so good in blue,1,25,6
can't wait for her teaser,1,25,5
"Why do you even imply that he wouldn't let them write their own songs? Don't just make things up to fuel the easy narrative of YG being evil. Maybe the girls don't want to / don't have the ability to compose their songs. Maybe they are not good enough. What is most important first and foremost is good quality, the girls at least said that they have influence on the work with teddy so there is that.",1,401,77
"Comments are stupid, but dear god Jisoo is jaw dropping.",1,56,10
Yeah Stay isn't black or pink but straight up blue.,1,51,10
Visual QUEEEEN.,1,15,2
I think half of the songs will be more on the pink side. They did say that they wanted to make songs with a summer vibe to them.,1,128,28
"bought from kpoptown, hopefully it comes in 1 piece haha. &amp;#x200B;",1,70,11
"I mean, you could push your way up. VIP has their own section I think. I could be wrong though ",1,95,20

did they ever talk about wanting to write their own songs? genuinely curious,1,76,13

I just want to see them shake it like this. [  I just want to see them kill it at Coachella. Thats why I'm hoping for a more black side of them. ,1,145,32
Hotel/Casino I think? Was confused for a while as well. ,1,56,10
Who are Paradise City? All I keep getting is the Gun N' Roses song.,1,67,14
"Yea but I think it is inevitable though. Anyway, there must be bias but overall it should be fine, as solo works within a group is not a new thing for Kpop groups. Any new materials releasing will make everyone mad already haha",1,227,43
"I‚Äôm just over this whole ‚Äúmy bias‚Äù vs ‚Äúyour bias‚Äù stuff. It‚Äôs immature. I hope it won‚Äôt get worse with all of the solos coming but I know it will, so disappointing ",1,164,32

"I see two general definitions of ""pink"" whenever people bring up the duality of BP. Some define it as the opposite of BP's main girl crush concept, which is the cute concept. But others refer to anything that's softer, that's not the electronic/dance/banger type as the pink side to their black. I would agree, AIIYL is the most ""bubbly"" and cute of their discography. ",1,369,64
"Honestly, this song is so good. I would watch an MV for this song 50 million times. Just me?",1,92,19
CF for a hotel/casino,1,21,4
"indeed, the hashtags say a lot",1,30,6
Blackpink isn't a dual concept. So...it'll be blackpink.,1,56,8
Serving truth to blonks.,1,24,4
"That is interesting because i think see you later and especially really were something blackpink hasn't done before, so there was already a fairly good mix imo. I still agree though, at the end of the day i want them to release interesting pieces which most of the time means something rather unique and not copy and pasting the same sound over and over again. ",1,361,65
What is this? Her solo debut?,1,29,6
"[Source](  &amp;#x200B; Caption: Hey friends, Well, many fellow BLINKS warned me of potential complains if any four of the queens were seemingly treated less equally than others...well I totally see what they meantüòßüò≠ I understand some of you have been disappointed for sometime due to some members of BP seemingly being treated differently than other members... With all due respect to your own personal points of view on this matter, I for one think BP is only BP and is so great for the four members‚Äô own unique individualities that are so different from each other, yet still make a one great team as whole. I think Jisoo‚Äôs teaser is absolutely awesome and beautiful. 1.5 seconds shorter than Jennie‚Äôs because it focuses on her side of the story without the deer running around ü¶å Instead of demanding 1 dimensional equality in creative outputs, I think we should focus more on supporting and celebrating each members‚Äô great achievement of being the great global Artist that they are, individually and as one team. I am very happy and proud of Jisoo and her teaser from my campaign...and I absolutely do not think any of the members of BP should be a subject of comparison to each other as they are in no competition to be better than others...they should be celebrated and rather be appreciated for their individualities and unique differences from each other. But this is a free space, so I hope you will find means of self-expression of your minds, as long as they are not delivered with profanity, vulgar display of hate and angerüôèüèª For those of you who care to, please enjoy the rest of the campaign and be HAPPYüôèüèªüíìüôèüèª Sincerely, üêß \#differences #in #individualities #and #creative #expressions #do not equal to #inequality #keep calm and Jichuuuuuuüíì &amp;#x200B; == There we go, immature blinks again and again.....

"damn, visual AF. what a beauty. üñ§",1,33,7
"Everything prior that album. ""I Like It"" on FREE'SM shows the first signs of their new style. ",1,94,17
"I mean, Blackpink doesn't really do all-pink or all-black concepts like other dual concept groups. Rather than a dual identity, their different colors are more of a spectrum. Even their brightest songs like AIIYL have that black edge to it, and vice versa. In other words, it will certainly be both, it's just a question of which way each song will trend. My hope is that their title track is split right down the middle to introduce their new audiences to their concept, while the EP itself trends pink, since Square Up trended so strongly toward black...and, well I miss that lighter side!",1,591,103
guys imagine if this is Jisoo‚Äôs solo concept,1,44,8
God damn,1,8,2
"Yes... Jennie's teaser has much more content, background, deer... , and even Jennie's Hanbok style like a movie, that's why it appears much longer than Jisoo's one here",1,168,28
"only by 2 seconds! jennie's was faster paced, there was a lot of stuff happening (it felt like a movie trailer teaser lol) jisoo's feels more like cf, i'm also dying at how gorgeous she looks!!! ",1,195,36
That sounds awesome ü§ó Can‚Äôt wait to see it myself! Hopefully my Blu-ray (version 2) comes soon üòÄ,1,96,18
Was hoping it was a bit longer and maybe also an outfit change.. Jisoo truly is THE visual of this generation. ,1,111,21
It's interesting how they toned down the choreo to make it less sexy. Less butt shaking etc,1,91,17
Second this. Jisoo is so gorgeous.,1,34,6
Bitch.... I'm ready.,1,20,3
She's stunning from any angle.,1,30,5
"kind of disappointed from the length, and lack of change in scene and outfits, but not surprised. At least Jisoo's pretty smile makes up for all of it. ",1,152,28
I need more PLEEEEASE,1,21,4
CLC's latest song is more mature dark girl crush kind of like 4Minute. BP song's don't really have that feeling yes it's girl crush but they maintain an innocent girlish charm to them which is why they also attract very young female fans.,1,238,43
"I agree mate, feels like is much shorter than Jennie‚Äôs teaser ",1,62,11
Too short...,1,12,2
Plz Jisoo you're killing me. üòç [Instagram]( ,1,44,7

"I agree, but its a shame, there should be space for both.",1,57,12
"Does the crystyle qualify as old songs? If yes I couldnt disagree more with you. Mistake, Liar and Hobgoblin are straight bops.",1,127,22
Well shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.,1,25,2
"You've been knew, man. I got my eyes on you, too. üëÄ /s",1,54,13
AIIYL. The girls just look like they're enjoying themselves so much in that MV it makes me so happy.,1,100,19
"Although Stay was a ballad-ish folky soft song, it's still on the dark side so I feel like it would be classified as one of their black songs. AIIYL and Really is most likely their pink side songs. But true, even their pink side songs are more powerful and different than other groups' songs",1,291,54
As long as I get a banger and a ballad I don't care.,1,52,13
Nerd tactic: let the jocks beat eachother out and hide in the back then come in for the final blow,1,98,20
That's good to hear. I ordered Ver.2 and can't wait for it to arrive.,1,69,14
"I hope it's black. People are sleeping on CLC, but they used to make very pink pop songs like Twice, but then changed their approach completely. They are making very black songs now and I personally vastly prefer their newer songs over their old pop songs. ",1,257,46
"I'd want a mix of both tbh. And I hope their discography diversifies their sound as well. While I really loved 'SQUARE UP', I think they played it safe with their songs in terms of production. I really do hope they put in slower songs and heavy hitting songs in this upcoming EP. I want BLACKPINK to musically evolve over time while taking the best out of what makes their sound unique. Don't release stuff for the sole purpose of meeting the number quotas on the charts, but rather the longevity of the group. ",1,511,94
"Does 'STAY' actually qualify as a ""pink"" song? Overall it's a ballad and it doesn't really fit either pink or black. I'd say 'AS IF IT'S YOUR LAST' was their most ""pink"" song. ",1,176,33
AIIYL because I never got tired of looking at it. ,1,50,10
"BP doesn't do ""pink"" the same as other girl groups. Their softest song is Stay and even that's more of a ballad than a proper cute concept song like Twice's stuff. My ideal album of theirs would be 3:2 bangers to softies.",1,221,42
I believe YG said her solo is going to release after the comeback this month. So maybe a May or June release. Maybe later.,1,122,24
It's been confirmed that by the end of this month they are releasing their comeback. No date yet. But they are filming their MV this week. ,1,139,26
I think mainly black with 1 pink,1,32,7
Probably black as they are signed to UMG and western usually prefers strong and powerful songs rather than cutesy poppy song,1,124,21
I like all BP M/V's but STAY is the most memorable to me.,1,57,13
cant wait to see your editing &lt;3,1,35,7
"Man, this was a hard question to answer. I really like all of them, but I would have to go with Boombayah. It's the combination of rollerskating, sweaty Jisoo and Lisa's rap that puts it on top for me. After that, it would probably be AIIYF. I love that video's happy, summer song feel and all the looks the girls have. After that its a tie between Whistle and DDDD, followed by another tie between Stay and Playing with Fire. Embarrassing admission: I sometimes actually get teary-eyed watching their videos. I probably need therapy.",1,534,94
im still waiting for the day YG stops being an √¢≈õ≈° and lets blackpink write their own songs. im curious on how the girls can write songs (the only example on where the girls wrote the lyrics was the Korean parts of jisoo's cover of clarity but that's simply hearsay),1,266,50
"AAIYL for sure. ros√© looks absolutely stunning, jennie's cute pouty face, lisa's adorable head bop, jisoo with the heart magnets. its just such a fun video overall.",1,164,27
"I totally agree about how eye-catching D4 is. I picked AIIYL, but combining how much I love the video &amp; song, D4 would be my favorite because it's just so beautiful to watch. The scenes, fashion, colors &amp; lights are all so eye-popping and visually compelling. I also adore Lisa &amp; Jennie's rap scenes. I mean, how do you beat eating popcorn on a bejeweled tank on a shopping spree?? lol It's very unique and just has so much energy visually! But I think it also gets a lot of energy from that song, which is my favorite BP song, so I picked AIIYL for purely the video. (I do love that song, too! But I love it with its video even more, if that makes sense.)",1,668,127
so I have two rivals now? who else? i'd go through all of you to get to my queen. /s,1,84,20
"Well, I was here first buddy. So y'all have to get through me first. /s",1,71,15
"I love each of them for different reasons but I think my favorite based purely on the video is ""As If It's Your Last."" I love the playful concept and humorous bits. Jisoo trying to make those heart magnets meet-up and staring at them with such a perfect mix of confusion/dissatisfaction/indifference makes me laugh every single time. Jennie's *look* at the camera in the scene with the stuffed animals. Lisa's head shake. Rose's surprised expression on the stairs. She's just so pretty, too; I love her writing her name in lipstick! The fashion is super fun, as well. I love the contrast of the black uniform look with the bright pink backdrop (^*BLACKINK!*) The bright colors. The casual look in front of the yellow wall. Jennie's subway outfit might be one of my favorite looks any of them has ever worn. The way they just look like they're having fun, laughing and blowing kisses at the camera. It's just such a fun song, and the video 100% commits to making you feel that.",1,976,173

"The first half of the video was about one TV talent in Japan saying how she likes BLACKPINK (especially Jennie), and she usually tries to sing their songs with the choreography when she went to karaoke. Later on, she also explained the concept of BLACKPINK as a girl crush group, who are rather cool than cute. After that, there was an interview with BLACKPINK, which was actually aired back in October last year when they promoted Ddu du Ddu du and the area tour in Japan. In the interview, they were asked if there are any Japanese songs they like. Jennie said Jisoo loves Mika Nakashima‚Äôs song (specifically the song Sakurairo mau koro Ê°úËâ≤Ëàû„ÅÜÈ†É), and Jisoo covered some of Mika Nakashima‚Äôs songs in their concert, so the group started listening to the songs and they absolutely fell in love with those. After that it went on to show a sneak peak of Jisoo singing Yuki no hana Èõ™„ÅÆËèØ (another song from Mika Nakashima) in their concert at Kyocera Dome Osaka last December (that the DVD &amp; Blu-ray of this concert will be out soon this weekend).

The sets were amazing and really different though.",1,382,69

The 2nd Newark is most likely going to sell out too, it's like 60-70% sold out already and considering their comeback &amp; promotions I wouldn't worry.

Try StubHub or Seatgeek. I ended up getting mine through StubHub because I had the exact same issue as you; although the show I‚Äôm going to is sold through AIX not Ticketmaster.,1,176,32

I've tried on both the app and my computer; both get the same issue. I did purchase Red Velvet tickets a couple months back with no problem. I'm not sure if it's because these are resale.,1,187,36
well i was totally wrong about Jennie covering Guns N Roses,1,59,11
Are you using the app or a computer? Cuz I recently just bought ariana grande tickets and the app wasn‚Äôt working for me and saying the same thing but then I tried on the computer and it worked just fine. ,1,204,40

"TBH I was very surprised when Blackpink booked Prudential Center in Newark (Capacity 20,000). There are long-established, very popular groups / bands in the US that would never book Prudential. Maybe they saw BTS selling out these same venues and figured BP could generate the same amount of ticket sales? No idea how they do the math, probably a lot of guessing and black magic ü§î",1,380,66
"They are technically sold out, unfortunately tickets are up for resale meaning that scalpers bought up a lot of tickets. As to why the tickets that are up for resale aren't selling even though there are a lot under face value is anyone's guess",1,243,44
Unlikely and I hope that doesn't happen. Promoting alone (when the group is not promoting) like Jennie did will get each of the girls more spotlight and recognition and also ensure that they get media coverage for a longer time throughout the year.,1,248,43

"I was overcome with the biggest mixed emotions today as my GA tickets to their LA concert left the seller's possession and is on their way to me via UPS. What pissed me off was UPS showing that the package dropoff happened in MARYLAND, which reminded me again how I was scalped but I just had to buy them. But I'm so excited because this is finally going to happen in less than a month!!! My feeling is BP will still play all \*their\* old songs, but get rid of Jisoo and Rose's covers, and maybe Solo and Kiss and make up as well (assuming they're adding 4-5 new songs to the set). I wonder what they'll do with Lisa's swalla segment, because that's even less than a cover but seems to be wildly popular (from their Asian tour). ",1,730,139
I'm willing to be very patient about their comeback but this whole build up to their partnership with a resort chain seemed very underwhelming from beginning to end. I first thought Paradise City was some DJ I never heard of and they were gonna collab. Whatever. New pics I guess.,1,280,50
Lookin classy af,1,16,3
"Can mods create 1 thread for this or stop allowing this because it seems like there will be many more from this guy. Apparently this is the ""beginning of a series of teasers that will be released progressively according to the campaign story line"".",1,248,44

"This was extremely well done and I hope that girl gets tons of views. These are the kinds of talented ""low budget"" remakes I like to see, not the more popular but absolute shit work done by people like lankybox\*. \* what's most annoying about them isn't their budget but the frustrating way they constantly break character every 5 seconds to laugh at their own lame jokes.

"I totally agree! Calling it an ""epic collaboration"" definitely made me think music. I also assumed Paradise City was some kind of band or DJ name until I follow the Instagram link and realized it was some kind of casino or hotel.

"I understand your last point and I am hardly an expert on South Korea but the companies you're talking about are American and the attitude over here seems to be a little more relaxed. Is it the same way in Korea? I think people are more willing to ""look the other way"" in NA if a company continues on after someone involved screws up. From what I gather (again, not an expert) a lot of the SK public are raging at Seungri - rightfully so - and with YG himself not being the most popular figure to begin with, I don't know if everything will be alright. I certainly hope it will. I also hope that if YG is out as CEO that they put someone with....how can I say this.....more sensitivity in charge. ",1,697,134

"No problem. I‚Äôve never actually seen teasers for a CF before so I was slightly confused myself at first. It doesn‚Äôt help that the phrases they are using such as ‚ÄúEPIC collaboration‚Äù is basically clickbait, making you think of something music related. Interesting marketing strategy to say the least. ",1,300,49
Thank you!! I appreciate the explanation &lt;3,1,46,7
"CF stands for commercial film and is a blanket term for all endorsement type things where you make money. My guess is it will include all of them. We don't necessarily know the full extent of what it will be, that's why they are teasing us I assume. They might do some event there, a photo shoot, or they might part of advertisements for the place. There are CF songs but those are very rare and I highly doubt it, BP has never done a song for a CF.",1,449,89

With that being said, i think the songs were fairly different on square up, really is probably my favorite song on it precisely because it isn't the typical banger.",1,494,92

"Although I agree with you on EPs making song more special, for some reason my favourite songs have always been b-side that almost nobody listens to and having 4 big bop everytime makes it a bit ""too much"". Not that i'm complaining ofc but maybe i only need some ballads to hear coming from them.",1,295,55

Beautiful work !!,1,17,3
Alright alright calm down. I'm not gonna be a party pooper (originally I'm not) since it's definitely a great news BP is gonna make a comeback. All the best to their comeback cos the girls srsly deserve it with how strong of a fandom they currently have.,1,254,47
Been rewatching my favourite BP videos to feed my comeback hype and I had to share this - my favourite fancam of Rosie so far. This performance was like punch in the gut... in a good way? She absolutely killed this. ,1,216,41
"I think that Little Mix probably wants it too. I'm sure they want to expand in the west as much as Kpop wants to expand in the west. I think it would be good for one song at least, and it would be a good scratch on the back for both girl groups. I think that Little Mix's image is compatible with BlackPink (at least, I think with ""Salute"" because I don't know any of their other music.) But I think that it'll be cute for one song, two if it's a huge hit, but after that, Y'all right about having a DJ like Steve Aoki. ",1,520,106
"What has Navers bias to do with the content of the comments? Especially when the Naver article couple days ago about Jennie at the Hera Event was mostly negative (with lots of mentions about YG).

People on those posts are just happy about a BLACKPINK comeback. Don‚Äôt know why that is so hard to accept.",1,436,75
"imo for this comeback, i actually think it‚Äôs good that it‚Äôs an ep instead of a full album since they probably won‚Äôt be able to promote it properly/fully in sk. i‚Äôd rather wait for the full album even more than have it almost wasted if yk what i mean haha",1,254,50
Nah it‚Äôs not ,1,13,3
Get in line buddy,1,17,4
So excited for their comeback! Will they be changing the songs performed at their NA concerts? I still want to see them perform their classics.,1,143,25

But if it‚Äôs such a security threat I wonder why didn‚Äôt they make it for all of UK and just there? I hope that doesn‚Äôt happen at any N.A concert (where we‚Äôre so paranoid about security). Lightsticks are essential to completing the ambience of looking like a kpop concert.",1,410,72
Omggg never knew I needed this collab till now,1,46,9
YG isn't going anywhere..the man is untouchable.,1,48,7
Every member of YG represents YG at all times. That's what it means to be part of a group. Also it's one more example of how yang hyun suk is a major creep. ,1,157,33
perhaps he's a BLINK,1,20,4
Looks like Lisa,1,15,3
"Well YG probably still doesn't want to overflow the market with comebacks either, they still want to be a little more ""special"" than the rest if i had to guess. But the report mentions 2 comebacks a year, which is imo totally reasonable tbh. VIP's don't matter, well they still need to be interested but i am sure they are, what matters is that none of the remaining 4 artists get caught up in this scandal, if there is any connection between any of them and seungri in all of this then it's over for sure. As it stands seungri was the weakest link anyway, so BB should be fine on that lvl.",1,590,113
"Yeah it was below 10k, not exactly sure about the concrete number though. But we grew a lot since then, that is for sure! Another tell, their youtube subs. Before DDDD it was around 7 million, a little bit more than that. Now we are over 20M",1,241,47
"I'd imagine it's more like a tightly packed work schedule for this kind of work. You know, the one where you'll most likely pull a couple of (almost) all-nighters and work extremely hard but when the dust settles you have a long break to compensate for the past few days you've been destroying your body.",1,304,55
what was the sub number before the iconic DDD era? Was it below 10k?,1,68,14
"Yes in fact doing more comebacks is just a common sense for entertainment competitions. BB should be okay with the remaining 4 actually, I believe many VIPs know how to act now",1,176,32
so excited for their comeback!!,1,31,5
You know Naver invested in YGE right? (  Naver has always been biased to YGE for quite some time now so ofc the comments are going to be supportive of BP too,1,157,32
"The financial report which was posted here said that YG wants to do more comebacks in general now to build more trust, aka build stronger fanbases. It also said that they plan on bigbang still being a thing and frankly i totally see that happening unless they get somehow connected to the seungri stuff as well.",1,311,56
Oh that would be nice! I was hoping for a comeback stage there but hey that sounds even better. Showcases are usually enjoyable (the ones I've seen). ,1,150,27
I don't think it's too big of a deal anymore considering how much this sub has grown. They get downvoted early but end up 95%+ way later. I think it just has something to do with Reddit's algorithm and the fact that this sub gets brigaded hard by people. It's not as bad anymore compared to Jennie's 'SOLO' and dating news era. That shit was pretty bad during that time. ,1,371,70
"That it is an EP we knew for a long time already, so people freaking out over it not being a full album make no sense to me :D I'll also say it again, i prefer them only releasing EPs quite honestly, makes every song a lot more special, something i cherish instead of listenign to 12 songs once or twice and then picking like half of it and never listening to the other half again. With that out of the way, i still would love there to be more than 4 songs this time, 6 or 7 would be great to have! About other people saying this is rushed, well it is in the sense of there not being any teasers and not even a real date yet (that is the weird part quite frankly), but the negative connotation i get is that they think the quality will be worse than it should be? I really don't see that happening, they worked on this for a long time now so musically everything will be great (most important part), all the extras for the album are most likely done (photo cards, photobook, that stuff simply takes time to produce) and what we are looking at is them only having to film the mv. That one is done rather fast, the real work for the mv is the work you do before shooting, getting the concepts straight, building the props, etc. Then the editing, but even that's not a huge problem, in the end the video is like 4 minutes long at most, that doesn't take hundreds of manhours to edit. Overall i am just extremely happy it finally seems to happen, this is my 2nd BP comeback and if it is any like my 1st, holy shit :) Will be super interesting to see what the growth during the DDDD era actually accomplished in fan size, the 24h youtube views will be an interesting milestone/data point for that. I am expecting around 50M views personally, but we'll see. Hopefully this sub grows more as well, i still remember the days of below 10k subs, i wonder where we will be in say 3 months from now. Anyway, time to get excited, comeback of the year is just around the corner!",1,1964,380

"This may be a bit of a ‚Äûrant‚Äú, so I already apologize beforehand, because I don‚Äôt really want to be negativ on this subreddit, but... Could we please NOT downvote the posts of the Girls? I‚Äòm talking especially about their IG Posts/Stories etc. This is their Subreddit it would be stupid to specifically downvote their content. Not talking about ‚Äûfanmade‚Äú things or trollthreads. I say this because in the last couple of weeks I just randomly noticed it more and more, especially with Jennie &amp; sometimes Rosies Posts. Like 98% is whatever, but the IG Posts from Jennie yesterday went as far down as 91% (till I complained somewhere else about it and the people there brought it back up a bit, lol). Some of her older Posts are even under 90%. The rant is probably useless as most people, who downvote don‚Äòt care or even look in here, lmao. But I kinda wanted it off my chest.

Hope they won't ruin another [MR2](  like they did for Jennie's Solo. Had nightmares for **MONTHS** after the Solo's MV was released.

"Regions outside South Korea should have less impact, but not for South Korea. The scandal thing is really huge for South Korea and therefore the backlash aroused and YGE artists were even ordered to have a social blackout last week",1,231,40

"Me too. I think this time YG is acting like ""put all one's eggs in one basket"", because it is very sure that there would be backlash in South Korea, but still internationally hyped.",1,181,34
Of course the scandals could impact it. It's not illogical to think that an ongoing scandal could potentially sour the excitement and reception for a comeback and it's not a stretch to believe a company would wait until the storm has blown over to release new material. In fact I already see people claiming YG is only releasing the comeback news now to divert people's attention from the scandals going on (but these people forgot or don't know YG announced the comeback time period way back before all this shit). ,1,516,90
Just in time. New tracks and choreo on the polo fields!,1,55,11

I mentioned to someone else in this thread when I was looking through his IG I saw a pic of him with one of the NCT units. Dream I think it was and it looked like they did a performance there. I can't be for sure but that's what it looked like to me anyways. So maybe that's why he has connections is people perform there? ,1,323,66
she‚Äôs GLOWING,1,13,2
I was peeping at his IG too recently with this whole collab thing going on and saw in one of his pics he was with one of the NCT units. Dream I think? And they did a show. It looked like it was at their hq but I can't be sure since I saw the pic a little bit ago. ,1,264,60
She looks so pretty. I love that dress. There's that bear again...,1,66,12
Can't wait! I was wondering if it was going to be that and I'm glad they're still having a comeback. I'm so looking forward to it and then Coachella and the North American tour! I'm just disappointed it's a mini album.....But I'm happy for new songs!,1,250,46
Can‚Äôt wait!! Wish can skip ahead of time and hear their new songs right away üòÇ,1,78,16
FINALLY!! It seems like we have been waiting for years for this,1,63,12

Okay naver even posted an article (in Korean) mentioning that BP is gonna comeback in the end of March  ,1,104,19
They will be shooting the M/V later this week.,1,46,9
BITCH YES,1,9,2
Thanks for clarifying!! ‚ù§Ô∏è,1,26,4
Just checked twitter and now a lot of sources are saying the comeback is confirmed for end of March,1,99,19
"Yeah, I think they will definitely continue the Tour since they have contractual obligations etc. I just hope the girls get to perform without worrying too much about how the international blinks would respond to the issue. I mean look at how happy they were during the Asia tour, they were glowing though you can see they were tired at some point but the girls were happy af ",1,376,68
"Totally agree. Quite a good plan to start off the comeback together with the Americas and Europe tour, more international fans and they get to fulfill their (contractual obligation) with Interscope while waiting for the Seungri scandal to cool down a bit in SK. But I really think they need to address this matter asap, esp for our Korean Blink friends :( what if they get less promotions in SK, i noticed they do variety shows etc for song promotions and/or comebacks. ",1,470,82
"I hope so too. I wish we had better (legit) sources but I just posted it because I thought someone from the community can clarify. Nevertheless, I guess we shall wait and see, but the most important thing is that the girls are okay and they are posting on IG again. ",1,266,51
"As long as Blackpink's world tour continues as planned, I will be happy. Hopefully a comeback plus your right after isn't too taxing on them though. ",1,149,26
I guess we‚Äôll just wait a little bit more. I‚Äôm happy the girls are posting on IG again. ,1,88,18
I was hoping for a March 29th comeback but an April 5th comeback seems more realistic. There's a ton of groups coming back in April but I guess that's how just it is. I also saw this earlier. A financial report predicting the expected performance of the different entertainment companies. They had other companies listed too and other stuff not here like how BIGBANG is going to go on a Dome Tour when they come back from the Military among other stuff. &amp;#x200B;,1,466,83
oooooh id love to hear that! Do you have a link?,1,48,11
"This is very interesting, thanks for posting it! Early april seems likely at this point then, minimal south korean promotion. Trying to gain more fans in america, also to increase money made from say youtube because cpm is higher there. Last part is also interesting, more comebacks, 2 per year to give people a little more content and build stronger fanbases, seems solid. ",1,374,63
I think source is important for YG thing and I hope this is something updated by YG. He needs to address these matters.,1,119,23
Adventure Club played BP in their set last week!,1,48,9

I messaged the mods inquiring why it was locked &amp; still hasn't received any reply from them. I think your post fare better since it's still around with +9 net upvote. Not sure why the different treatment tho, maybe it's cos of I was a bit firm &amp; seen as aggresive in my phrasing/wording.",1,417,76
Blackpink is the revolution üíØ,1,29,5

I heard Kiss and Makeup the other day at a MAC (makeup store) in the Bahamas! I was so excited lol,1,98,21
I'm up in Seattle. So far I've heard 'SOLO' being played on tv during the Seahawks game. BLACKPINK's entire 'SQUARE UP' discography was played in a Night Market up in Vancouver. I've heard 'SOLO' in Starbucks too. ,1,214,37
I heard Forever Young at a Japanese restaurant and a Korean BBQ place in the Phoenix area.,1,90,17
"I only heard kiss and make Up, and was in a chinesse shop in Spain üòÖ",1,68,16
Kiss &amp; make up at the spin studio I go to!!,1,47,11
What‚Äôs the song at 4:50 minutes ?,1,33,7
I heard SOLO playing at starbucks while I was waiting for my drink. ;),1,70,14
"I agree there is some major mismanagement going on, BP should defiantly have more music. Though I will say while I know YG for sure wants to push into the American. I think this over the top push has be brought about by the Interscope deal, which I believe Interscope approached YG. I also think that the Coachella invitation was why they ended up playing venues that are to big for where they are in their development. As for the announcement of the tour being sold out, it is technically sold out unfortunately is the resale market that is making it look like its not. Whether YG had something to to with the scalpers buying up tickets I have no idea but I know that ticketmaster has long be accused of having deals with scalpers. May be wrong about all this. Hopefully it all works out in the end ",1,800,149
I heard Boombayah and Whistle at Korean restuarants in the states.,1,66,11
Kiss and Make up isn‚Äôt their song so it makes a little more sense that it was playing in the US. I still haven‚Äôt heard any of their song being played where I live but in LA I heard SOLO a few times. ,1,199,43
I've heard both Whistle and Boombayah used as music in floor routines in NCAA women's gymnastics. ,1,98,16
Damn this girl is supermodel material.,1,38,6
i still can't believe they used that crusty ass photoshop edit for the official youtube audio,1,93,16
"I don't think that's as valid a comparison since Kpop netizens put so much more weight on an artist's parent company than the West do. Most fans wouldn't be able to name the label record megapopstars like Taylor Swift or Selena Gomez are signed to nor the CEOs heading those companies, but in the K-entertainment industry, company background is a huge part of artist discussions. Kpop fans can match Korean artists to their respective companies without skipping a beat meanwhile if you ask American fans who the ""big 3"" in America are, the vast majority of them wouldn't be able to answer that. Also it's come to the point that YG himself is getting sued as well as being exposed for tax evasion so it's no longer just a lone act under the company committing atrocities. ",1,771,136
Ive heard Kiss and Make Up in Forever 21! ,1,42,9
"No, rca's stock did not drop 14%. YG's did.",1,43,9
not sure about that i live in romania and this is the first kpop song to make it on the radio its been played like crazy this summer and is still quite popular,1,159,33
"Kiss and make up is a big hit in Finland. I have heard it a lot everywhere; on radio, at malls, in bars etc.",1,108,24
"i didn‚Äôt hear it personally, but i remember a girl posting a video of D4 (or solo, i really can‚Äôt recall) playing in some mall, which is pretty great. ",1,151,29
"Which is absolutely bs... why would you hate them ? I think these people hating are just antis that can take advantage of the situation. But if someone is genuinely hating on any YG artists not related to this scandal, they got some serious problems",1,249,45
If I had to guess its getting deleted because it doesn't directly involve BP. It's also bringing out the worst in Kpop fans in other parts of the internet. ,1,156,29
"&gt; If YG falls bp could turn to teddy (black label), interscope or P Nation. They would most likely be owned by interscope if yg fell Imagine BP with Interscope. That would be the revolution. ",1,194,35
"I completely agree with everything you said. To be completely honest I could see YG being forced out if things don't improve. Its weird to think of YGE without YG but I think all of the hate that YG artist get is as a result of the hatred for YG himself, which is ridiculous to think that people wish for the failure of artists because of one man. I actually believe that fresh management may be a good thing though. ",1,417,80
"Can we talk about the giant mismanagement from YG? Claiming a sold out tour, not putting out more songs in 3 years after debut and trying to push for the NA market. The girls are getting torn up right now because of this. I feel bad.",1,233,46
I think they are being deleted because it's just people panicking with no evidence to show that BP is being to affected by it. No shows cancelled or anything. And this is mainly a sub for BP not YG.,1,198,39
"YG as a company will not close down. As a publicly traded company it does not matter if YG the man is removed or faces an asset forfeiture. YG the company has its own money from investors and the board of governors will select a new CEO if YG the man decides/is forced to step down. As the main YG act at the moment, new management would more than likely push more BP content/image/music in order to recoup loss of revenue that the scandals will bring. With Seungri‚Äôs scandal it is unlikely Big Bang as a whole will see a comeback, but solo careers from GD and Taeyang will definitely still happen once they are discharged. The company will not be closing down due to personal scandals, even those affecting the CEO or one of the largest acts. See examples: Papa John‚Äôs, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon. ",1,797,145
"Help a sister out! Selling 3 BLINK VIP tickets for $300 each. I bought 4 thinking my sisters will come with me, unfortunately they changed their mind after another world tour was announced. üòï [pics](  ",1,201,35
"If YG falls bp could turn to teddy (black label), interscope or P Nation. They would most likely be owned by interscope if yg fell tho, so that could later result in even bigger international projects and stuff. However, considering bp's insane popularity and their popular label mates (bigbang ot4, ikon, winner), i dont think YG falling is something that would happen. Worst case scenario, yg goes down, bp disbands/splits up, brand falls with them and the girls get left on their own. ",1,488,83
"I also find the need to add - Let's not forget how huge the Blink fandom is. How much of a following the girls have. They're huge stars already. Even if the Korean public reacts badly to them in the beginning, which they most likely will, they also have a huge international fanbase. They can sail through this. They have huge endorsements and also American labels to support them as well. This might be a rough patch for the girls but they will definitely come out stronger. They'll have even stronger motivation towards their music this time and I honestly cannot wait to see them back on stage.",1,597,108
"Adding to this, I just think that since they've already released a statement that they plan on doing better in managing their artists and also the YG shareholders taking action, we can really hope for some actual improvement in management/schedules/releases etc, despite the bad press and an obvious decrease in value for the YG brand name. What I'm trying to say is, it could be a bad stretch for YG as a company, but it could mean better things for the artists. Let us just continue to support them and hope for the best.",1,523,94
"Even if YG end goes into any real trouble, I think there can be a way to manage their current artists in their subsidiary label - black label? Worst case scenario is there's a major reshuffle in management and losses but I don't think they will abandon the artists, nor is the company itself going to vanish. ",1,309,57
I think its an important matter.... why do they delete them? :S I really like blackpink and I already hate that YG havent gave them what they deserve and now I dont want them to lose what they achived,1,200,39

jennie is so photogenic hot damn. üî•,1,35,7
"I think this post will be deleted very soon lol because it seems that we can't discuss the scandal and YG thing here (there were many deleted threads which are also revolving around YG &amp; BP), but as you can see as threads on similar topics, questions and discussion keep being posted by blinks, this should be something that many are concerned as after all BP is a YGE group and how BP will go is really related to YG himself.",1,430,81
"Andrew Oh is the Chief of Future Strategic Planning of the Paradise Group H.Q., a big resort corporation, but I don't know why he has so many connections with K-entertainment industry too. He actually had taken many photos with BP and many other famous Kpop groups or Korean artists. I think he should also know YG very well.",1,325,58
"International Queens. I think that this collab really brought more western audiences to BP which is so amazing. Completely deserved, this song is a total bop.",1,158,26
"There are no real relations to seungri's scandal other than seungri being part of the label (not anymore btw). I guess he is still ceo of ygx? I cannot find anything about that. Assuming YGE would go down (which they probably won't, unless they are majorly connected to this big scandal which is way bigger than kpop btw, this is about politicians and conglomerates most likely, the kpop idols going down atm are tiny fish and scapegoats) then blackpink would probably simply not exist anymore. Unless some other company buys all the rights to the brand and the girls all sign there as well, not sure how likely that would be. But it's ridiculous to even worry about something like that atm, there is no immediate danger of that happening anytime soon. Not sure what your point about the parents is, blackpink has no connection to any of this as far as i am aware.",1,864,155
Just peeped his IG. Who is this Andrew fella and how is he so connected to the K-entertainment industry üòØ,1,105,20
"It's ok, Lisa soon to be #1 in the West, maybe #2 but only after the English language connoisseur and linguistics professor Roseanne Park. ",1,139,24
I see some common drawing mistakes. Bottom of the toy handle doesn't line up correctly. Anatomy issues with the ears and fingers. Wrinkles of the jacket are odd. There are other things that catch my eye but I don't think the artist will even see this comment.,1,259,47
I think this also proves that BP is really an internationally-recognised group.,1,79,12
This song got 0 promotion and it has 100million views. That shows the power of blackpink fans! ,1,95,17
"I am just happy that they are allowed to post again (if there actually was a ban, which seems extremely likely). Now i really hope that there will be teasers tomorrow, the time window for a comeback before coachella is closing but it is still definitely possible. Would mean limited promotion in korea though, but that as pretty much always a given with the intended late march comeback.",1,387,68

"I agree completely. I think that Intercope and UMG are expecting new music for western promotions and YGE may even be contractually obligated to release this EP, I'm just speculating of course. Who knows, I'm trying not to get my hopes up but I'm just excited. ",1,261,46

"Omg it is so good to see new content, i hope this means potential teasers for a comeback soon as well &lt;3 Really is also probably my favorite song of their latest EP at this moment, it just sounds so good and produces the best live performances because there is no strict choreo. ",1,282,53
Rose just updated stories as well,1,33,6
I feel like the Earth has tilted back on its axis now. ,1,55,12

I think this also proves that the social blackout should be lifted. They should upload the 200M views poster for 4D dance practice videos and things like that lol,1,162,29
Nah yous shouldn't generalize Koreans like. Not all of them are like that...,1,76,13
"Yeah I think it's Nayeon, Sana, and Tzuyu who are currently the most popular in Twice when it comes to Korea. Maybe I should say Koreans don't connect with south east asian idols.",1,179,33
I guess the social media ban is now lifted and we're back to our regular programming. I missed my babygirls so bad üò≠,1,116,23
Is there a list of BP @ WWCY subbed episodes? Cant seem to find them anywhere and thanks for this episode!,1,106,21
Are not Sana really popular in Korea tho?,1,41,8
I'm not sure Koreans care all that much about personality though. Everything is all about looks and nationality in that country. &amp;#x200B;,1,141,22
clownnation lets risee,1,22,3
an album of all the concert live versions ,1,42,8
YES OMG ,1,8,2
ooh good observation! ,1,22,3
"to be honest, Jisoo's looks is not the only thing Koreans love her for, they also love her personality and how she treats everyone with kindness.",1,145,26
Because Jisoo has the protypical look that Koreans prefer...like Irene.,1,71,10
I just realized I need the reggae version for Really to be released.,1,68,13
Oh my holy god it shows HONG KONG concert !!!!!!! üò≠üò≠üò≠,1,53,11
The intro song sounds different from the previous episodes where they put their own songs. Maybe is a hint to their comeback üò∂,1,126,23

"400K views in under an hour, the thirst is real.",1,48,10
Jennie asking Lisa to go through the 16 shots dance moves is the cutest thing ever ma babies,1,92,18
"Jisoo almost murdered my ears with that loud slurping during the ASMR, but what can I say, the whole ASMR was truly a blessing",1,126,24
ikr..she barely gets any jobs smh and Korea just love her. As for Lisa I'm not expecting her to be top 10 but 42?! I'm starting to think Koreans just don't really connect with foreign idols.,1,190,36
"Lol how does Jisoo have such high spots every single month, when all she does is breathe, Korea really is in love with her",1,122,24
"Their 16 shots dance is their sexiest/most badass performance yet, I'd die too. That part in the middle of the dance when all the backup dancers stand down and the spotlight shines on just the four girls as they half dance half catwalk down the stage, PHEW.",1,257,47
Cool. We get a free Really rehearsal vid as well,1,48,10
I almost had a heart attack thinking this was some comeback teaser.,1,67,12
How do you check these statistics?,1,34,6
This is good timing telling Blinks to not worry so much.,1,56,11
Thank God they posted something üò≠ ,1,34,6

Solo is a highly-loopable song. I love it.,1,42,8
"I agree. And people need to stop being too sensitive and always finding fault in critical statements. No one here means to offend. We see that Lisa and Rose might be underweight, and express our concern. No need to label that as ""body shaming"". ",1,245,44
"You are kind &amp; generous for wanting to give your sister such a fun, amazing experience! Kudos to you for such a giving spirit. FWIW, you might be able to sell them! You could always try and then if it doesn't work out for the price you want/originally paid, just keep them, go anyway &amp; enjoy every moment of it! But honestly, you never know. If someone wants to go badly enough, they will pay it. Just from my own experience, I saw Taylor Swift's 1989 tour but had to buy tickets resale after it was already sold out. I couldn't afford tickets when they went on sale originally (at Christmas time, thanks T-Swift!), so by the time I could, people were re-selling them for way more than what they were originally worth because of demand. But she was fabulous and it was worth it! So maybe!",1,796,147
What do you mean by production lacking compared to 2NE1 stages? ,1,64,11
"I just want to say that I don't know enough about the complicated nature of the ongoing scandals to understand if or how it will affect BLACKPINK, but I am 100% here for these girls and I hope they do not become collateral damage. They are too talented, hard-working and all-around wonderful people to be caught up in someone else's horrific mistakes. So, whether it's appropriate or not for them to comeback soon or whether they will or won't be able to because of the scandals, I won't claim to understand... I am 100% here for them no matter what, however long it takes &lt;3 In the meantime, I finally had the opportunity to order their official lightstick and welcoming kit, so I'm excited for my first BP merch!",1,717,129
ughh Well played YGE,1,20,4
"&gt; Ah I forgot many ppl here don't really visit other sites/threads other than this sub reddit &amp; many are probably newer fans who don't speak Korean, considering the most recent promotion of BP to the US. No i am informed through korean sources actually, if you want to actually give evidence give evidence and cut the rhetorics, that won't work here. &gt; I don't really wanna talk about stock since I think it's irrelevant (in short: stock prices rise &amp; fall all the time, it's not even a ""correct"", in its literal sense, valuation of a company since it's basically based on demand/supply, I can elaborate on this if you want). This really has nothing to do with stock and other YGE's financial state. For what its worth, though, investors are pulling out their money from YGE. The total withdrawal was around $100 million (KRW 55.3 billion). Big yikes either way. You literally did so in the op, so i expanded on it. Losing investors is bad, but as far as i am aware some of these claims are not even validated, LVMH for example has the option to opt out until later this year. &gt; And no, these wrathful ppl are not only your regular BP haters, though they definitely are over the moon wetting themselves rn, regular citizens are also angry. Seungri, YGE &amp; Yang Hyun Suk are all related since Seungri is made a CEO of YGE's subsidiary. They are business partners, it's really hard to disentangle that relationship in front of the public. I'd say this is the reason why ppl are also raging towards YGE &amp; Yang Hyun Suk. Not BP haters, YG haters in general. Well yes the only connection is through seungri, him being ceo of the subsidary or not, there is no real connection between the actual scandal and YGE. There could be, but so far it is all seungri. I am not denying that some people will guilt YG or other acts under YG for what seungri did or did not do, but i don't think this is representative, i have some faith in common sense. ",1,1960,356
I love this!! Thank you!! :),1,28,6
You mean I am being a centrist?,1,31,7
"Your phrasing is familiar. This is the kind of statement structure that political trolls use here and on Facebook. ""I'm sure that (good), but (bad)."" Cushioning, then casting doubt. But instead of being a Russian troll, you are pro-JYP, anti-YG. Interesting. You have dedicated your life to this? üòÖ",1,298,49
"Well I'm sure YGE can bounce back once the scandal clears up and maybe Yang Hyun Suk voted out as someone who has a say in the company. Some $100 million have alrdy been pulled out of the company tho. If YGE is to survive with new management team and a new start, I'm sure investors are gonna come swarming in to get a piece of their pie.",1,338,68
I think you are overreacting. Companies have bad news all the time but investors are the same the world over: if someone is dumb enough to bail out on a fundamentally sound company (they are sitting on a proven goldmine in BP) others will happily jump in to profit off them. SK is no different.,1,294,55

I'd say this is the reason why ppl are *als* raging towards YGE &amp; Yang Hyun Suk. ",1,1168,203
Afaik he owns some % of shares but definitely not the majority so I'm sure he can be voted out. YGE has various institutional investors that make up its majority ownership overall (excluding retail investors),1,208,35
I think a Diplo x BLACKPINK track would be out of this world ,1,61,13
If he is found guilty for these charges the investors will force him out of the company. Unless he owns more then 50% of the company he won't have much of a say in this/. Unless Korean laws protect against this ,1,211,41
"&gt; And no, I'm not buying the counter argument of saying that it's just an over-dramatization on my part and ppl are still gonna listen to BP's songs once they comeback. That means it's either: a) you're delusional b) you aren't cognizant enough of how big of a scandal it is and/or underestimating the anger from the public it garnered ""If you don't agree with my statement which have no actual evidence then you are simply wrong"". Nice one there. YG's stock isn't even at the lowest point it ever was, ofc it is a problem atm and they would rather not deal with it, but YGE isn't even really connected to any of the seungri stuff as far as i am aware, other than the tax evasion which happens all the time and usually gets dealed with with fines, there is mostly directed hate at YG for basically nothing. Haters jump on it online, the same people who also jumped on other scandals before, this isn't representative. Calling for other agencies to buyout BP is honestly laughable, if you like it or not but BP is what they are because they are part of YGE on top of being the girls we all love. Teddy alone is a huge reason why. Also something people never actually keep in mind, BP are a girlgroup and we deal with things which have mostly women as victims, if anything the male YG groups would get hate at this point (additional one) ",1,1339,249
"Tbh this is one of the most ideal closure for the whole mess. I hope that since Yang Hyun Suk is being sued, he will finally be forced to step down &amp; someone much more competent takes charge of YGE. The onus is still on YGE (post-Yang Hyun Suk replaced) to gain trust from the public back &amp; to build its image back, that the ""new"" YGE is truly reborn as well as leaving behind all of its shady dealings.",1,411,80
People who like black Pink will still like black pink. People who hate black pink will still hate it . It won't be that much of an impact on the black pink brand. And for the company this will most likely mean yg will leave the company someone else will run it appointed by the board and that will be it. And at most this scandal will only remain as long as there are trails . After The trails are done People won't talk about it anymore.,1,438,87
"Idk maybe change your mindset to be prospective a little bit instead of being retrospective this time. What I'm concerned is after the fact, mate.",1,146,25

YGE? not YG himself? ,1,21,4
"I mean, I'm not saying a totally binary statement. I'm sure some ppl are still gonna listen to BP but a lot of ppl (as in the general public not only Kpop fans) are really rattled with what's going on. I'd say it's gonna put quite a bit of a dent to BP since they're associated with YGE as one of its groups. And personally, don't you at least feel some sort of repulsion after knowing what YGE &amp; Seungri are engaging in? I'm frankly surprised you say ppl in the US would be indifferent.",1,491,95
Wtf I just listened to this.... my impact ,1,42,8

TBH, the company has lost its focus, all this side ventures into food/bars/mixnine are just a waste of money when he should have been focusing on music and his artists.

This is definitely from CH+. She posted it and then deleted it after a while.,1,77,15
Someone want to fill me In on what‚Äôs happening? This popped up on the front page and am confused af. ,1,101,20

The problem I have with it is when your a forward facing company, I don't think you can just blackout. While investors and shareholders are super important, the people who buy products are also important. The complete blackout helps none of the uncertainty. Honestly as much as I want the comeback, I really just want some information from YG about whats happening with the company as a whole, not just BP but all the artists. While I know he doesn't owe us this information, I feel its important for him to inform everyone of the situation. Another big problem is that I have a feeling that Interscope and UMG are expecting new music for the promotion in the west, there is also that to contend with. &amp;#x200B;",1,1013,183

she does. im sure this whole situation has put a ton of stress/anxiety on them. üòî,1,81,16
I really hope they all are. She looks worried in this photo though.,1,67,13
visual goddess. üíñ glad we got some kind of reassurance that she/theyre okay.,1,76,13
"Sorry, i might have misunderstood what you said. What YG is currently dealing with is something huge and serious; I believe it's just right that there should be a total social media blackout for their artists and no matter how much we might want BLACKPINK to have a comeback this month, we shouldn't demand for it as it surely will affect their promotions, etc. As with Anda, as shitty as it may seem to be, considering she's their new artist and she already has debuted, it might be YG's only way to test the waters, but he really shouldn't risk it imo.",1,554,102
"I agree that 2 gg groups is way to much. Honestly though for me if we're talking solo artist, I'd much prefer a rapper.

Thanks for letting me know",1,323,64
Not a thing lol,1,15,4
"It's a bit odd though, don't they usually ride around with a member of management, assuming shes in a car, I may be wrong. Surely if she was live chatting she'd have been pulled up before doing it.

Probably. She posted this around 4 hours ago. Just forgot to share it here then.,1,80,15
I agree with this completely. I don't hate Little Mix but they're styles just don't match for me. And LM definitely have that sexy vibe which may be too strong for Korean fans. If they did do a collab I think a video is out of the question. I much rather see then collab with a DJ or solo singer. 2 gg is too much. I'm rather annoyed with the amount of clickbait articles suggesting there's going to be a collab just because someone said that they would. ,1,455,88
This is how they can communicate now: post then quick delet,1,59,11
She always is. üòâ,1,16,4
Took all my worries about them in a snap.,1,41,9
huh is it already removed on CH+ ?,1,34,8

My day is better now. ,1,22,5
She finally breathed thank God ,1,31,5
"So what is it that I missed, if any?",1,36,9
collab with AZWZ ,1,17,3
I'm hoping they make a load of connections with producers/ DJ's at Coachella. ,1,78,13
"Your reading my mind, Martin Garrix is exactly the DJ I had in mind. I was listening to Ocean on the way home from work the other day and was just thinking it would be a dope if collaborated with BP. I hadn't thought about it but your right Lisa's vocal and rap on a track produced by Don Diablo, with that sort of understated sound he has, that's giving me chills just thinking about it. ",1,389,76
"Lisa's weight is 44 kg or 97 pounds. Her height is 167 cm or 5'4. I never thought of her as scary skinny or anything, but seeing that episode really shook me. She has a bmi of 15.8. I don't understand how anyone in this thread can just go ""They eat a lot they're just naturally skinny"", or showing the clips from BP house. YG as a person is not exactly a paragon of virtue, he could definitely put them on diets, plus having BP house edited to look like they eat a lot. Or just make them lie on camera.",1,502,101
"I've definitely noticed. Debut, they were all pretty slim, and I saw Rose was still have a lot of stamina and energy when she was performing on stage, plus she seemed to be naturally skinny. I never thought any one of them looked unhealthy. Watching the GMA performance just made me sad. Rose's legs are almost smaller than my arms. I hope this doesn't sound like I'm shaming her for being 'stick thin' or saying she's not beautiful or anything. I'm just very concerned for her health. With Lisa: The girl is under 100 pounds. She's like 5'6. She is extremely underweight. I'm concerned for her as well, although seeing Rose in particular makes me very worried for her. She seems much thinner than debut. Honestly, Jennie seems to have the healthiest body of them all but she is also incredibly slim haha. I've always suspected her 'lazy jennie' issues starting because she just didn't have any energy. Jisoo seems fine imo. I don't notice a huge difference from debut era. All in all, I hope this doesn't sound like I'm body shaming them. I'm really not. I'm genuinely concerned for their health. They all look like they need to eat better.",1,1141,202
BlackPink x Martin Garrix would be a banger! ,1,45,8
"Anda just posted on IG, ban may be over fingers crossed ",1,56,11
"This isn't for me honestly, I'm not really a fan of Little Mix. I'm not sure its a good fit. For a collaboration I honestly think the best way to go is to collab with a DJ, while I'm not really a fan of DJ Snake and it was only a rumour, that's more the direction I'd like to them go. Something like the BTS Steve Aoki collab. ",1,327,68
"I agree it's a good time to reassure everyone. With stock prices having taken a hit and fans beginning to worry, laying out a solid comeback schedule for all his artist would be a good way to remove some of the uncertainty and probably improve stock prices. It will also help build excitement for the US tour. I really believe it's a massive error to delay BP's comeback, especially as I imagine that UMG and Interscope are probably expecting new music for their US promotion, YGE may even be legally bound to do so. Who knows. ",1,528,96

"Its about time he posts something, even if not bp related",1,57,11
 Wow the modest envy feeling I got from this was unexpected. I kind of wanted to go there but eh. Hope you enjoy it!,1,116,24
In my experience everything will sell out fast except for lightsticks. I can only speak for BTS concerts but even on the way out it looked like they had thousands left and they must have sold thousands. What I did to remedy this though was if the group is playing two days in a row (which I‚Äôm not sure is the case here?) I went the next morning at about 5am to get in line for the store. Unfortunately others have this idea too so I couldn‚Äôt get t-shirts and stuff but I was able to get pretty much anything other than those,1,524,103

keep it,1,7,2
Do they sell stickers ? ,1,24,5
I hope Interscope is knocking down YG‚Äôs door right now demanding that BP‚Äôs comeback be released soon ,1,101,17

"Hey hey!!! I'm going to the BLACKPINK concert (It's my first ever concert!!) in Canada!! I want to get a lightstick there and from my friend's past experience, lightsticks were sold cheaper at the concert (I believe she went to a BTS concert and their lightsticks were sold $10 cheaper). So I was wondering for the other blinks from other concerts were the BLACKPINK lightsticks more or less expensive (Compared to online) and based on experience would you rather buy online or in concert??",1,490,84

Well he needs address the situation and set the record straight so we aren't all left wondering. All this hiding without saying a word is BS.,1,141,26

I miss Yang Hyun Suk so much hope hes doing well these days,1,59,13
"If it's on the website, I have to think he's going to address everything. It'd be the worst I understand that YG is in a PR crisis, but to not address BLACKPINK's Timeline for the next couple of months is only going to deepen the wound. There is way too much uncertainty from fans and shareholders considering the timing of this scandal is so close to BLACKPINK's supposed comeback and western promotion period. ",1,412,73
"Well if true this will probably be the state of the union address I've been hoping for. Fortunately being from the UK I'm about to go to sleep so this will probably greet me when I wake up, so I haven't got to wait for it. Hopefully there's some good news, if true of course &amp;#x200B;",1,287,56
Yeah doubt it has anything to do with Blackpink most likely about the scandal. Don‚Äôt be surprised if the comeback gets delayed because of it either unfortunately.,1,162,27

"I think it's much more likely that they quietly don't promote the release in Korea. I think UMG and Interscope will win out and get the music actually released, but stuff like music shows, fanmeets, and variety appearances are off the table. UMG and Interscope won't care about those things as they aren't really things in America. They already got BP and talk shows, the only other common denominator of US tours from US labels is touring after releasing new music. They'll probably release, have a showcase on vlive so people can see the dance, and then go mum again until Coachella. ",1,586,102
"Yeah and that's before fees. It's a good thing, but it's also kind of lame we paid so much to start.",1,100,21
I have a feeling that the entertainment industry side of the scandal is concluding since they're saying the corruption goes even deeper and apparently an even bigger issue will be brought up in the upcoming days. We shall see.,1,226,39

Really? I thought it was a cute/funny little joke. ,1,51,9
" The minimal make up and the hair just set this look off, the outfit is dope as well and her eyes are killer. It's funny because I've had this sort of fantasy that on the new EP there would be a Jennie x Lisa track that would be a nasty hip-hop track, where they both just snap. It would be written by them of course, the track would be called Queen's or Reign or something like that (needs some work), it would be a full black track not an ounce of pink and they'd just take aim at all the haters, the YG style of not giving a Fxxx about what people think. This is exactly the concept I'd hope for, all black outfits, sophistication and swagger. Just wanted to indulge in some wild speculation. ",1,696,135
"Still not sure about this being related to the comeback. What group announces teasers and comebacks through a venue? This sounds more like a promotional deal. I‚Äôm patiently waiting for more music. I‚Äôll wait another 2 months if it means the music is quality. Just not seeing how these Paradise City announcements are related other than timing. Could be wrong of course, it‚Äôs just my opinion. Worst case scenario would be a song release that‚Äôs basically a commercial for Paradise City. Haha! I think Blinks would go nuts on YG at that point. Hahahaha ",1,549,94

I deleted these comments as I'm being way to negative which is something I try not to do. Positivity from here on out ,1,118,23
"A little harsh tbh, I'm not trying to be negative. Although I must admit it kind of sound like I am my bad. It nice to see the members and honestly I have considered taking a step back. The problem I'm having is there's been a lot of negativity in the post I've been involved in and I've tried to help people be more positive but it would appear I've fallen into the same trap, so I apologise, honestly thanks for waking me up to the fact",1,438,87
I see... Yes I agree with you too. This Paradise City thing has sort of witnessed the drastic change of what's happening these days.... But I think you know well too that YG definitely won't say anything now (as usual). The best move he has done lately was the statement on BP already,1,284,53
Wow I just noticed. What was she doing before this. üò≤,1,53,11
Those veins!,1,12,2
It just that these teasers were fun at first with all the speculation but now they seem to be dragging on a bit and not really saying anything. The only thing I'm really enjoying is seeing the girls especially with the IG ban. At this point all I really to want is a state of the Union message from YG just to let people know what's going on because there's an awful lot of negativity floating round ,1,400,77
Omg I just found out WINNER had a fan meeting there and there's also this   it looks like an amusement park/event üò±,1,115,22
So you have no idea whats coming up but instead complain. How about wait you avoid these posts for 2 weeks and comeback and give your opinion once you see it.,1,158,31
u/CRaXII maybe you'll be able to see them this time eh?,1,55,11
"Yeah and I think they will give away teddy bears, I remember they had an event at the airport and they gave away teddy bears too, maybe fan sign related ? At this point I'm just happy to see ANY positive update about them. ",1,223,44
No need to say sorry üòÖ just a reminder. Thanks for doing your part for updating us about BP üëç,1,93,20

I'll double check next time I think I was half asleep still üòä sorry! ,1,69,14
"While I appreciate your concern for BP and all the other YG artist, there is no evidence of a boycott of YG artists other than people shouting on the Internet and if there is I would like to see some evidence ",1,209,41
Haha you got me I was re checking dates ü§£,1,41,10
"Yes, and based on what happened these days, it is obvious that many South Koreans, including many non Kpop fans, are really boycotting YG artists now...",1,152,26
"As much as love seeing my girl Lisa looking gorgeous as always and slaying in that dress, this is getting kinda tiresome. I hope it turns out to be epic but at this point I'm failing to what would make it epic. ",1,211,42
I honestly agree. At this point if it's anything that's not comeback related it will be a major disappointment for most people. I know these thing are sorted out well in advance but with things the way they are at the moment this feels a little tone deaf if it's not comeback related ,1,284,53
is YG even part of the Big 3? I think BigHit took YGE‚Äôs spot ,1,61,14
"I was about to post this, god damn it",1,37,9
This isn't fun anymore ,1,23,4
all of the YG artists + Black Label under Psy.,1,46,10
[Excuse me but YG is definitely Dr Pepper]( ,1,44,8
"You're getting some good answers regarding the differences between the big 3. However, I do want to stress that while Seungri is the most popular name involved, it is not simply a Seungri or YG scandal. It's not even just a kpop scandal. This is shaking up Korea itself. It's regarding systemic sexual abuse that even involves high levels of police and politicians as well. It's much bigger than Seungri and YG. The names haven't come out but there's no way its limited to what we know. You can bet people from many labels are involved, and it probably expands to other areas of wealth as well. It's focusing on kpop as the providers but the demand has been widespread. ",1,670,120
"It‚Äôs still pretty accurate tho The sales for each group show the power they have with their fan base, and just with the last years sales, it was an absolute landslide. But yeah if you consider the most recent scandals that popped up, JYP is on top, then SM, then YG at the bottom and is probably the worst place to be at right now in the public eye. ",1,350,69
"Yeah That's what I think too maybe some kind of residency or special concert. Or maybe some bp inspired rooms, I mean it's a hotel isn't it.",1,140,27
"By the way, I think you have mistyped the date 190315",1,53,11
"Their names are clear. It is Seungri only that has been in any real trouble as of now, not YG (so far) and definitely not the girls. Please do not speculate such things about any women/female idol being harmed. It is unnecessary and will lead to bad rumours. They are not involved in any way. Only as far as being under YG ENT. They obviously had interactions on camera with Seungri but we can have confidence that our girls are well protected by the management at YG (even if only because they are the biggest stars in YG right now). And the girls have been far too busy and very much in the spotlight since they debuted for them to be caught up in any of this behind the scenes. The only thing they must be dealing with right now is confusion because of the respect they had for Seungri as their senior and concerns for their own careers and comeback.",1,853,161
I think that would beyond a major misstep. It might even violate the contract or agreements YG had been made with UMG. There has to be new music or else why UMG would sign BP. ,1,176,35
"Honestly, I think it would be a great idea if BP becomes a group under PSY's brand.",1,83,17
Of course I hope it is related to comeback too........ Many of us do........ But comeback things should be released by official channels not by a resort.,1,153,27
That is legit what it is gonna be. I'm not getti ng too hyped ,1,62,14
I think you should ask this same question in  subreddit because here there will definitely be a lot of bias and similar POV because everyone in this subreddit is a Blink.

"YG - badass, mafia-like(didn't know this was actually true, swag, hiphop, rap JYP - fun, bright, friendly image SM - (not a fan so i dunno much except for Suju in variety) people say they're the most obsessed with visual and perfection(in choreos etc.) YG is alot more strict with his 3rd gen tho. The younger artists are mainly just focused on music(at least they're still establishing theirselves) than someone like Seungri who only seemed part-time idol with all his activities. YG stans like their artists for their duality(being goofballs offcam and badass on stage) while performing and offcam. YG antis think the artists are all try hards lol",1,649,109
I‚Äôm not saying anything but I‚Äôve been so nervous thinking about this. Is there a possibility that they were raped or involved in some way? I really hope their names are cleared soon because this hurts me and I feel horrible for my babies,1,237,44
"I wonder what this collaboration is, my new theory is related to a special showcase or concert, what are your thoughts? Source: @eskimo7474 on Instagram ",1,153,25
"What intrigues me is learning how each of the 3 reinforces certain singing styles. I thought that was simply group-specific, but supposedly JYP singers half open their mouths and sing in these rapid short bursts, others (I forget SM or YG) open mouths wide and belt it out similar to an Opera singer. It sheds more light on something I came across while researching the new group Itzy. One commenter wrote that because the singer Lia used to be with SM before switching companies, her SM past was proof that she could sing. I was confused, because .. shouldn't everyone everywhere be able to sing? But she's their vocalist and not main dancer so I guess that's what they meant. ",1,678,120
this is kinda true tho lol,1,26,6
"Thanks. I did come across comments that YG supposedly threw 2NE1 aside when he knew he had a ""prettier 2NE1"" on his hands.",1,122,23
"Thank you for this. \#3) I wonder if this is why Jennie had that brief relationship with Kai. I'm sure there's been dating scandals at all companies but I initially attributed it to Jennie's western cultural immersion and greater likelihood of ""doing what makes her happy"" (like a stereotypical American teen). \#5), at least in the U.S Coke has a much larger market presence over Pepsi. Which is why at many restaurants people will ask for Coke, and some waitresses will come back with ""we don't have coke but is pepsi ok?""",1,524,92
Ty for this! Yes!! Daebak!!! This is the type of info I was looking for. Btw that girl in the video is super talented. I'll check out the netflix at some point. I was already aware of YG having been a member of a Gen 1 boy trio in the 90s. ,1,240,51

"So when you know shitty YG is, you feel even more bad and sorry for the legendary BP ",1,85,18
"1) I think it‚Äôs pretty fair to consider JYP the ‚Äúcool dad‚Äù, all in all. He seems to take a very big interest in his groups‚Äô wellbeings. Especially Twice, but that may change with Itzy being the new babies. And all of the rules and extra stuff he sets in place seem to feel less of ‚ÄúI am your boss, now do as I say‚Äù and more ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been where you are, I want you to be your best, this is how it‚Äôs done.‚Äù Of course, this might just be me projecting what I want him to be onto his rules, but this is my personal perception of JYP. 2) I honestly think Lee Sooman is probably the most competent of the three as a businessman. The way he conducts everything is very professional and he seems to have the most comprehensive grasp on marketing, I think. Whereas JYP is full group or bust 99% of the time (there are some scandals and stuff that can account for this, but still I think it‚Äôs largely detrimental as long as the group foundation is strong), SM is ok with Red Velvet segmenting and doing some solo stuff more frequently. 3) I probably have the smallest understanding of YG, which is ironic considering where I‚Äôm answering this question. It does seem like the more laissez-faire company, which seems like things are forgotten for too long and unnecessarily so. It almost feels sometimes like YG had some unprecedented successes and just didn‚Äôt know how to handle it all correctly. 4) This Seungri scandal is enormous, and to my knowledge largely unprecedented. It‚Äôs probably/hopefully a one and done, and that‚Äôll be the end of it. As to how he got away with this, it‚Äôs not necessarily YG‚Äôs fault. I don‚Äôt know to what extent, but I‚Äôd imagine Seungri as a businessman is largely unconnected to Seungri the member of BigBang. All of K-Pop are on fairly tight leashes. Everyone is highly scrutinized and have to stay squeaky clean as far as public image is concerned. So many times the smallest misunderstanding has caused wild speculations and ‚Äúscandal‚Äù. 5) I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs more popular, Coke or Pepsi, But it is safe to call it that. In record sales, it‚Äôs 1-Twice, 2-Red Velvet, and 3-BlackPink. In 2018 sales alone, it‚Äôs 1-Twice, 2-BlackPink, 5- Red Velvet.",1,2161,390
YG is smart enough to know that having no comebacks before BP‚Äôs Coachella and US tour would result in riots from the Blinks. At least I hope so. He‚Äôs on very thin ice right now. ,1,178,35
Wtf weren't soundcheck tickets originally like $250? Good to know the scalpers are taking massive losses lol,1,108,17
"Yeah, even if they comeback in the US stages, I still think it's important to consider how the Korean public is going to take it. Better to be on the safe side, like you said.",1,175,35
"YG has been heavily criticized by almost, if not, the entire KPOP industry for his ‚Äúterrible‚Äù artist management skills. Several examples of this can be shown by: -Seungri Incident -2NE1/Park Bom Scandal/Disbandment -Replacing 2NE1 with 2NE1 Pt. 2 (Blackpink) -CL and many other artists in the dungeon -Lack of Blackpink comebacks -Dating/marrying a girl at an extremely young age. ~~ JYP is typically known/accepted as the best entertainment company today. JYP has shown extreme care for his entire company and is really known as a father. This can be shown from his actions such as: -Installing a fresh oxygenator in every room of his entertainment headquarter because he said he wanted all his employees/trainees/idols to be breathing the purest air possible. -Installing an organic buffet in his headquarters. Recently he stated that he spent over $2 million dollars in one year just on organic foods, not only for his idols/trainees, but for every employee that is under his company, because he states that when everyone is healthy, the company gets healthy as well. -Managing TWICE extremely well and putting content frequently. However, this is also being contradicted by many as people state that he is working TWICE a little too hard, but he is definitely giving them the breaks they deserve. -Pressing legal charges against those who are spreading rumors of TWICE being connected to Seungri‚Äôs scandal. ~~ I‚Äôm not really that knowledgeable when it comes to SME though. Hope this helped!",1,1494,242
"They absolutely have their own cultures or ""images"" [This vid actually sums it up in a funny, and quickly (it's 2:14 mins)](  and it's so true Shortest summary I can make: SM are your traditional ""pure"" idols. You'll find mostly scandal free, ""pure image"", cute/innocent vibes in their music with girl group. Even their ""Sexy"" choreography don't have very sensual moves (say compared to, EXID, or AOA). Biggest controversy with them though is overworking their idols (many have left and sued them), as well as supposed bias against Chinese members. JYP is a bit similar to SM with the ""pure"" image being mostly scandal-free, but their musical style is/was heavily influenced by retro, which is mostly due to JYP's influence when writing music for his groups. You'll find a lot of very very simple but repeatable lyrics, that are always upbeat, meant to just get stuck in your head. It's all about simple, repetitive, hooks, including choreography, (Tell me, Nobody, Knock Knock, 10/10 etc.) f you've ever heard SNSD's Gee, it's basically that concept for the majority of their music style. No big controversies come to mind with them. YG is kind of on it's own with more western influenced image. They emphasize kind of the ""gangster"" or ""cool"" image with their idols. Even in cutesy moments, BP don't have anything that even remotely resemble any of Twice's songs. They're songs are not about simple They still kind of stick to idol standards with ""dating ban"" and what not, but style wise it's totally different from the other two. They don't worry as much as the other two about having ""mimicable"" dances or songs. Anyways, if you're interested in the history of the three, there's a short 30 min Vox documentary on Netflix called ""K-Pop Explained"" if you're interested. ",1,1774,299

Like you said, we might be completely wrong on the effect that this scandal has on BLACKPINK from the general public, but I'm willing to bet that the GP doesn't associate BLACKPINK with the scandal at all. YG has stated that he plans on having 2 comebacks for BLACKPINK + the Rose solo.

"It doesn't mean anything, internet hate has no real weight and it doesn't represent the true feeling of people. Just look at the campaign to boycott the Captain Marvel movie, which is approaching 600m in just over a week, clearly it didn't work. These people who a hating on BP would be doing it regardless of this scandal. For this to actually be a problem people who love BP would have to start turning their backs on them and that's not going to happen. I may be wrong but I'm pretty confident that I'm not, 2019 will still be BP's year have faith ",1,551,103
"I agree completely. I've been thinking a lot about this comeback as we all have. It will be a massive error on YG's part if the delay the comeback, obviously the scandal is a problem but I stand by what I said before the hate the BP and YGE get online from knetz is not representative of the SK public as a whole. Another thing I've been think, isn't there a redeem code for the new EP attached to the North American tour tickets, so YG may not have a choice but release it or risk problems with Interscope. I really hope that YG doesn't send them on their American tour with no new music, I really think that would be a major misstep. ",1,636,124
Fingers crossed,1,15,2
This is how Knetz are now trying to boycott everything related to YG as they longed for... 2019 should be the year for BP to prosper but now.... They can't do anything because of something which they are not even related.... ,1,225,41

Rosie had uploaded a set of mirror selfies (one of her best IG posts tbh üò≠) and but shortly after she deleted / archived the post. Around this time Samsung also used a clip from DDDD at their Galaxy 10 keynote presentation. Speculation as to why Rosie removed the post was that it had something to do with her phone as it was very clear she was using an iPhone and that perhaps the girls had something in place with Samsung. Also their phones were censored / blurred out in the tour diaries. ,1,492,93

Dropped it on a concrete floor from about chest height. I'm about 167-170 so it's kind of a high drop.

"Probably... YG has always been the black sheep of the KPOP industry. They have so many scandals but the Korean GP always appreciates the music and put them in a pedestal and because of this YG artists developed this superiority complex. The way YG does not bother to fix his relationship with broadcasting companies is a great example. And due to this superiority complex, Kmedia is probably monitoring all their movements just to see if one of the artists will finally commit a grave mistake that would finally sway the GP. And there you have it, Seungri finally fell into his own trap.",1,587,103

" Here are my thoughts regarding the comeback/scandal issue. As much as I don't want the girls to comeback this March because it would be seen as a distraction to the current scandal. It would be foolish for YG to not stick to the schedule. (TBH, he's always been foolish) No matter when they comeback, this cloud of negativity will always follow them because they are under YG Entertainment. They cannot escape that. So it's best to just get over it, do the comeback, let the chips fall where they may, we will be able to see where the Korean GP stands. If it's negative promote less in Korea for now, then they would be away from SoKor, then on to Coachella and the North American/Europe tour. If the comeback is successful, I don't want YG to do his usual style of mediaplay. I don't want them to halt their activities just because some shady people are associated with them. These people allegedly done atrocious things to women and the fact they can affect the girls' livelihood would be another thing to add to their list of crimes. I say Fxxx that. This is another test for Blinks both Korean and International. It's so stupid that the scandal didn't even come from any of BlackPink members. I hope this is the time to clean up YGE, thank goodness I already quit being a YG stan during 2NE1's disbandment. BlackPink is the last group, I will stan from YG. The board of directors if any of them are not shady should root out all their shady dealings. YG is probably shooked since his greatest creation is now in shambles. He has to realized that his misogynistic tendencies won't be tolerated anymore. I feel sorry first and foremost to the victims and to the faithful fans of Big Bang. Well Blinks it's time to Square up",1,1726,313

The formula for fees is QTY \* (Ticket Price + (Ticket Price \* 0.26)) + $7.50 per transaction. It may be wise to continue to wait and get these for even cheaper, but I wanted people to know as I love a deal and I love Blackpink!",1,506,101

"from their perspective, the shows are already sold out. every ticket offered by the venue was bought at face value. but it seems that a lot of people only did that for the purposes of re-selling for profit and there is less actual demand to go (for various reasons, location/time definitely a factor) which is causing the secondary market price to drop so much ",1,361,64
"there was a rumour floating round that there were 2 girl group members in the Jung Joon Young hidden camera footage but that was confirmed not true, so anti's are dragging BP and Twice saying it was members from one of these groups.

"I think a big problem is that these dates are midweek instead of weekend, that just makes it so much harder for a lot of people to actually go out, especially when they have to travel there from far away in the first place. I hope YG realizes this as well and (in the worst case scenario where a lot of tickets won't sell) doesn't totally think that BP has no demand, i think that would be foolish as well.

But realistically we cannot change anything about it and there is still a lot of time until that tour starts anyway, in between there will most likely be a comeback and us promotions. Let's imagien the worst case scenario, the dates don't sell out and BP plays in front of like 10k people instead of 15k+, yeah that would suck and would give haters room to attack as well, but overall that wouldn't be absolutely horrible either, if BP cannot sell enough atm they cannot sell enough and it is good to know that. It's also worth considering that these us dates aren't on weekends either, that might be a big deal as well. But yeah, let's just wait and see what happens in the next 3 weeks, i am sure it will be fine all things considered :D",1,849,159

"so my sister is a big fan of blackpink and has never gone to a concert yet. i remember being her age and wanting to go to concerts so bad but being too poor to go. it wasn‚Äôt until last year when i went to my first concert (BTS); it was the best night of my life, so ofcourse i want her to go see Blackpink. well i leave work early to try and get tickets when they went on sale. i was refreshing for like thirty minutes, but couldn‚Äôt get tickets in my budget. i freak out, anxious and angry, and buy two tickets on stubhub for about $300 for section 306 in the back row for the fort worth concert, leaving me with about $6 in my bank account. i know, i know, this was stupid on my part, but i know that feeling of not being able to go to something you love. well now they added another day for fort worth and there are still tickets on sale in much more reasonable prices and i‚Äôm kicking myself. how was i supposed to know they would add another show!! i‚Äôm just so mad at myself. i‚Äôm tempted to just sell my tickets and buy new ones for a better price, but no one will want seats in the back for like $200. shame on me, shame on me...",1,1133,231

Can you bring in a lightstick?,1,30,6
Wow that is a really well done piece! ,1,38,8
"Honestly if I'd have heard a couple of weeks ago that BP would comeback in April with no really fan fare or Korean promotion, right before Coachella I'd have called bullshit but then Sunmi came back with Noir and flew straight out to her American tour. While I don't necessarily buy this 'insider info' it makes a lot of sense from the to promote more in the west. ",1,365,68
Well once the comeback happens they'll soon be touring in US for a couple of months away from this mess which is a positive. ,1,125,24
"I agree. I can see why people are struggle with this whole thing it's a shit storm but I think people reading comments from 'netizens' and assuming that it's truly representative of the opinions of BP or YGE in South Korea. While this is a massive scandal in Korea which is far bigger than Seungri at this point and I imagine that all eyes are on it, I really don't believe that the general public are all that aware of the connections between BP, YGE and Seungri, also I don't think they care. Part of the problem is how quiet everyone is and I understand why they went on blackout but I think YG really needs to reassure people. ",1,631,119

But now BP, Lee Hi, Akdong Musician, Winner, iKon, Anda, and even CL and many others, they are all innocent and their career could be all ruined just because of a single decision from the jerk. This is struggling to many people as their success really comes from that jerk to a certain extent, but the jerk is the jerk.",1,393,74
"I just read that a black label composer called out Seungri on IG saying he didn't jump he was pushed out of YGE, which honestly was obvious. So I guess they decided to put everyone on blackout, which is interesting since the YG dancers I follow are still posting IG stories ",1,274,51
Just in time before their debut at Coachella and the rest of US tour hopefully,1,78,15
"The silence honestly isn‚Äôt helping in my opinion, especially YGs silence. UMG and Interscope can‚Äôt be happy right now. Unless YG is trying to separate the scandal from BP, but again, he hasn‚Äôt made any type of statement other than they didn‚Äôt know Seungri was going to retire. I just hope the girls are okay. My worry now is their comeback is going to be rushed and pushed to save YGs face. There is still plenty of time for a comeback but each day it gets a little bit more worrisome since more and more comes out about the scandal. ",1,534,100

Just because Johnson and Johnson is being sued for [Baby Powder](  doesn't stop people from buying and using Acuvue, Band-Aid, Tylenol, or any of the other 70+ brands the company markets. Just 6 days ago, YGE released R.Tee and Anda's song, *What You Waiting For*. Go back a couple days and see Blackpink's brand ranking is holding strong at #1 for 3 straight months with the last thing being released Jennie's Solo 4 months ago. The only people that don't want a Blackpink album this month are those trying to keep the 9 song meme alive.",1,648,113
"I still haven't seen anyone making the connection between a blackpink comeback and it possibly being seen as bad for YG/the girls. Where does this come from? This seungri scandal is affecting YG because seungri is part of YG, other than that there really is no real connection so far, nothing which would make other YG artsts involved or anything like that. Quite the contrary really, it just becomes bigger and bigger and is more about some prositution/human trafficking rings, police corruption and as far as i can tell government/politicion and corporate leader involvement. One could say that YG needs good press right now, and a music release is just that, it has no connotations towards this at all, it will just be seen as music and if it is good people will listen to it, even moreso because blackpink is one of the hottest groups in south korea right now. Don't just listen to korean internet warriors who post kneejerk reactions on their social media and web pages, it's not different from our sites and not representative. Now i am not saying that it is the best time ever to release the comeback, but i really fail to see why it would be better to not comeback at all, that's quite frankly nonsense. Especially because as far as we can see (looking at the dates we know), it was always planned to release the comeback rather late this month and do minimal south korean promotion, there will be more worldwide/us promotion in comparison.",1,1448,254

i really do hope UMG scoops up Ikon or Winner. Or have them shipped to Japan again during this scandal. Or include them and all other talents to The Black Label. YHS shouls probably be sacked and replaced.,1,205,38
now is the time for Interscope to produce a full English album for BlackPink.,1,77,14
I hope you‚Äôre right but the whole 9 songs thing is gonna look a bit tragic when they come to the west,1,101,22
It should be related to YG apparently. YG artists can't show up now as YG is in scandal now,1,91,19
more International promotions c/o UMG/Interscope and have them collaborate with their talents to lessen the backlash. Like Rose with Taylor Swift or Ariana etc.,1,160,24
"I know there is a big difference between Asian music scene and the Western music scene. As an iBlink, and an old iBlink, I can separate artist from their label mates. I have seen many scandles involving musicians but never seen the backlash against the record company. For me a comeback would not be effected by the Seungri debacle. But Korea is their home market so would probably mean more to them to be a hit there than abroad. On the other hand how many of these people saying they are boycotting YG arstis because of this are not just haters that would have found any reason to hate on BP? Your right about it being best for the world tour and Coachella to have some new songs though. ",1,690,129
nah. Interscope will still handle their stateside and non SK promotions. BP should focus on International promotions instead,1,124,18
who gave her those flowers? I hope its JK hehe,1,46,10
I think they will delay the comeback sadly but I think it‚Äôs a bad idea in terms of their western appeal and I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if their western promotions got cancelled too,1,186,34
"True the backlash is crazy, even though blackpink's popularity has been crazy in South Korea lately, and have gained many and many loyal fans, still this will not save them from the backlash they could potentially get. This is not just a ""Seungri Scandal"" at this point, apparently from Korean general public's perspective, its a national scandal involving politicians and other celebrities and past events. So anyone linked to YG is walking on a thin ice as of right now. At the same time, this month is a golden chance for Blackpink to have a comeback and properly promote it before performing at Coachella and starting their North American Tour, because they have gained alot of international fans since last comeback and are probably anticipating their first comeback experience with Blackpink. If Blackpink delays their comeback to April, they will have a week at the longest to promote it in Korea and that's it (Of course they would do international promotions, but they need those Korean awards too at the end of the year). Or if they delay the comeback further, after that from May to June, they have full schedule of touring, and so the earliest date would be probably mid June, and this could really affect them. They will officially become that group that has ONE comeback every YEAR, and the competition is increasing so its gonna become harder to stay relevant no matter how popular and influential they are. So its probably a chaos at YG right now, and I really hope that they think about this well, and make the best possible decision for Blackpink's future, because this is a crucial point in Blackpink's career. **No matter what happens, I hope we blinks nation stay strong and be there for our four cutie pies.**",1,1731,298
"Yikes, saw from Twitter that LVMH pulled out as an investor from YG. It's a very bad thing, right?",1,98,19
"Yes shits got real, but I also think that coming back in Korea will do no good for BP, and is very likely doing harm to BP because of the YG backlash (like many K-netizens are now doing). It is now almost confirmed that BP's comeback is delayed (to at least April imo), and I think coming back outside South Korea should be more ideal for them now.",1,348,68

I just feel bad and sorry for them as they don't have any say to their plans and their plans can still easily change. I understand this is one of the fan pages of BP and fans expect many praises and support. I support them too, but we still have to face up to the reality as the plans of BP is still connected to the internal management of the company itself. ",1,642,124

"Ok, but then i don't see where you are coming from either? YG signed a partnership with interscope to promote them in the US and possibly europe, there will probably be more effort put into them this year than the years before and we already saw parts of that this year. The plans are 2 comebacks and the solo releases, now that can change a bit ofc (i would assume that there won't be all of the solo releases this year), the 2nd comeback makes sense though towards the end of the year. I just don't see what people mean with ""deserve better"" quite honestly, yes there could be more music at this point but it seems like this year will lead to that. In the end the success if what is most important, and they have plenty and they aren't even at their peak yet. As i said, i think people should really think about these accusations and contemplate/introspect to see where these thoughts are really coming from.",1,910,169
"Of course they are doing extremely well but still they can be even bigger and better. To me, it's not only more music but forseeing where they are at two to three years (or even further) later from now. ",1,203,39
"I don't want to get into all of this again because i did so multiple times already, but every time someone posts things similar to yours i think they should ask themselves what they actually mean with that. Blackpink is arguably the biggest kpop girlgroup globally, it seems like they did extremely well. They are at a point where they are big enough to have a worldtour where they are able to perform in front of huge crowds no matter where, that is something girlgroups in general aren't able to. The girls are living their dream, making a lot of money and the growth doesn't seem to be over anytime soon, quite the opposite. So when i read ""BP deserves better"" i interprete it as ""i want more music"" and nothing else really, all i see is demand and not much else.",1,766,142

"&gt; I agree. Don't really see how delaying BLACKPINK's comeback makes sense. I understand that BLACKPINK will be dragged by haters just because of the recent scandal, but they'd get dragged no matter when they release their comeback. I highly doubt that the current investigations are going to be over very soon. This shit is deeper than K-Pop and will most likely keep going on over the next few months or so. &gt; &gt; What is even more detrimental is if BLACKPINK were to not release new music prior to Coachella and their upcoming U.S. tour. Absolutely agreed, what people have to realise is that YG's plans are bigger than just korea now, this is about US promotions and possible european one as well. There definitely will be a comeback in the next few weeks, the girls worked on it, jisoo teased teasers recently, the hotel stuff just got teased which is probably at least somewhat related to a cb, etc. &gt; I think international fans put too much emphasis onto K-Netz comments on a social media platform. I'm not trying to lessen the severity of Seungri's scandal. KNetz comments are NOT representative of the General Public IMO. At the same time, I'm going to take the side that if BLACKPINK were to release a comeback on schedule, they would not be judged on their association with Seungri. They'd simply be judged by the music itself. Feel free to disagree with me here. The people who take issue with BLACKPINK being a part of YG or have association with Seungri are the ones who already have ill intentions towards BLACKPINK and are hopping on the bandwagon to exacerbate the issue. Exactly this as well, ofc haters get more power with the scandals around seungri now, but they would have hated without it as well. The general public is more interested in there being illegal rings around these nightclubs, BP being under YG won't affect them there either way (or at least to such a miniscule extent that it is negligible). ANYWAY let's hope the teasers drop this week so people can chill a bit :D",1,2012,355

Welp in a span of 12 hours stan twitter went the brink of rioting because of no teasers to frantically praying that we don‚Äôt get teasers for at least a week. Lmao... fml. üòî,1,172,34
"how? with the Seungri scandal. I mean Seungri has retired. I hope BB continues as a 4piece. Hope the scandal wont affect BP, Ikon, Winner and other Yg artists",1,158,29
so hypebeast,1,12,2
"Well i just saw a lot of people who get all hysterical over not having teasers yet and trying to make all kinds of accusations and whatever for why that is. When in reality a late march comeback wouldn't necessarily lead to teasers yet, even without any scandal. What haters would say isn't all that important to me or to anything really I don't think they were terribly close tbh, but it is hard to say. We only have seen them interact here and there for content as far as i am aware.",1,485,93
Agreed. I‚Äôm just afraid of all the dragging that‚Äôs going to happen. This is terrible timing but I‚Äôm hoping the girls don‚Äôt let it pull them down.,1,145,27
"Isn‚Äôt it just common sense that it‚Äôll be within the last two weeks, YG usually don‚Äôt come out at once and since Anda is coming out first. My speculation is that everything‚Äôs done, they are just waiting for the timing and the girls are now practicing hard for the new choreo.ü§ûüèΩ",1,276,51
"Hello, salamat! ‚ù§Ô∏è ",1,19,3
"I think what people are worried about is the comeback being seen as a ‚Äúcover up‚Äù which there will be some people saying that but it‚Äôs not correct. The comeback was planned way before the scandal turned into this. But I agree, it‚Äôs a big hit. I feel bad for the girls, can you imagine your ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù being involved in all that shit, especially it being degrading to women. It‚Äôs gotta hurt a little. Granted I don‚Äôt know their relationship, their interactions just seemed like they were close ",1,495,89
"Some thoughts: The seungri scandal is a big hit to YG entertainment, probably the end of bigbang, general bad publicity for YG in the short term (stock drops, etc) so people think that this means the planned BP comeback won't happen after all. That makes no real sense, if anything YG needs the comeback to be a success more than ever now, i very much doubt they wouldn't drop it if it was being worked on all this time now, especially when they will start their US tour and added promotions in about a month. There are still 3 weeks until the end of the month, plenty of time for teasers and the comeback, don't lose your mind just because there were no teasers yet. For the last cb we had the teasers about 10 days before the cb hit, so i would assume to get news in the next week or so. Because we are allowed to share anything i am just gonna share the best female singer in the world right now in case you didn't know her yet:   Hopefully some of you get as much out of her performances as i did :)",1,1003,196

"This is a hypothetical but if this has nothing to do with BP's comeback (which I don't think it has) why release these collab info know right around the time we are anticipating a comeback, as it would appear all these pictures were shot a month ago. Now it might be because BP are in Korea for an extended period before the North American tour begins. I don't know what it would have to do with the comeback but it just seems like an odd coincidence, maybe they will be play their comeback at the hotel or maybe it's nothing.

"I agree the average person more than likely doesn't even know that BP is managed by YG, I think sometimes we as fans forget people aren't as informed as we are and they also don't care to be.

"My only problem with this situation is that it doesn't feel like YGE is in control. Other groups that comeback in April, they already announced that they filmed the MV weeks ago, already communicated officially about it. That makes it feel like they're in charge of the situation, everything is going smoothly. Meanwhile for Blackpink we had so vague words about ""mid to late March"", no MV talk, no details, nothing official, and it looks like it might be delayed to the last possible minute before their US Tour. It doesn't feel as well oiled an operation, like they just came up with it. I hope it won't be, but I'm worried it might be rushed and no as well planned. Which is weird because they had all the time in the world to prepare to this. I hope those worries aren't justified, but we'll see.",1,800,146

This info is just common sense.. it‚Äôs not ‚Äúsaesang info‚Äù. BP barely has any saesangs anyways. They travel with like 3-4 security wherever they go as well as their manager(s).

&gt; *They will come in the last week of March almost April according to sasaengs or maybe the first week of April DDDD teaser didn't drop until 10 days of release so still plenty of time for a late march release. &gt; *They keep choosing the songs and they will have more than expected &gt; *Interscope is pushing yg to have more songs Sounds like speculation how would they know. &gt; *Yg is not in social media due to the scandal This is protty obvious since he didn't post 700M poster or Anda's dance practice. &gt; *They will not have many promotions in Korea for different reasons(the scandals) Again speculation although they will not have time to promote as long as in the past since they have a tour shortly after. Scandal has nothing to do with it since BP is loved by Korean public and they don't care about scandals as ppl think or even know. &gt; *Good promotion from Interscope Yes they probably have TV Shows and interviews lined up while in LA b/c that's where the entertainment industry resides. ,1,1013,182
"I can imagine things being very tense at yg right now, theres blackpink comeback pressure x2 because of their upcoming concerts in the west and they need to release their new songs or all that western promo would be for nothing and the pressure from seungri and yg's scandal. Also i feel like Korea is emotionally invested in this scandal that blackpink promo could possibly be met with backlash. Hopefully it wont. But at this point, who knows what will happen. ",1,463,81
"I wonder if they are planning to promote at all. I mean, that would be weird for them not to but everyday that passes without teasers or a release day it makes more sense. They are losing time to promote. Unless they plan on flying back to Korea between Coachella performances ",1,277,51
Sasaengs are like paparazzi and mafia rolled into one. ,1,55,9
"Not sure how sasaengs would have this kind of info, but okay... and some of the points are kind of already obvious like yg being silent on social media because of scandal, of course people want more songs, if they dont release until end of march, of course they wont have time to promote (concerts and scandal), etc.",1,316,58
"I try not to support sasaeng info, because of the extremes they go to get info. I can see some of this being true though. Especially Interscope pushing YG for more songs ",1,170,32

Nice. I ordered the boxset as well. Was wondering when it might actually ship,1,77,14
"A ton of words in Korean are just borrowed English words, like chicken = ÏπòÌÇ® (chi-kin). So it makes sense that it's in Hangul. The Korean public doesn't say Blackpink, they say Î∏îÎûôÌïëÌÅ¨ (Beul-laeg-Ping-keu). Same thing with Super Junior = ÏäàÌçºÏ£ºÎãàÏñ¥ (Syu-peo-Ju-ni-eo).",1,259,42

And then Jennie‚Äôs Kuma &amp; Kai, Lisa‚Äôs Leo &amp; Luca, and Rosie‚Äôs Joohwangie. I do think Leo &amp; Luca are the visual of pet pink. I was leaning towards Leo before, but it‚Äôs undeniable that Luca is a very beautiful cat. And I still believe Joohwangie is not a fish. Who can high five their owner? Or enjoy being touched? Only Joohwangie. ",1,456,82
I didn‚Äôt know cats liked to do that ,1,36,8
Fucking shit! It‚Äôs so good!,1,27,5
"Wow this is amazing, you are so talented and hardworking üòå",1,58,11
"Yeah, she looks little bit different than on real picture, maybe that's because this is my first time drawing a portrait. ",1,122,21
"This looks sick! Dont get me wrong when I say, but somehow the facial structure feels different. Good job though with that drawing!",1,131,23
"Luca: ""Soon...""",1,15,2
Wow üëåüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª,1,12,2
Holy shit nice. Hope she notices this because this is unbelievably good,1,71,12
"Jesus! Teach me, this is so good!",1,33,7
I would rate this drawing: Call me pretty and nasty. You did an amazing job on this one and it was the best thing I saw today X),1,128,28
"Great Work, love it.",1,20,4
"Most people aren't *fascinated* by the numbers but as big fans of the group, it's good to see the girls continue to grow in popularity. Of course you also have to understand there aren't major news regarding the group every single day therefore there isn't a lot of meaningful content to be posted, hence why you may see a lot of trivial stuff, which is fine because trivial content is still better than no content. ",1,416,75
Thanks man!! ,1,13,2
"I saw this post on your Instagram and I wondered if I could like it twice, and then you uploaded on reddit so I actually could lmao. Great drawing dude!",1,152,30
But it's not translated in Korean it's just the pronunciation in Korean alphabet.,1,81,13
"It is frustrating. I'm also worried about a delay but I just feel that it is a perfect time to release new music, it will take some of the focus of the legal issues, it will increase YG's stock price, it will boost enthusiasm for the world tour and most importantly it will give the haters less ammo, so for me it couldn't be more perfect but I'm not YG. Like you said fingers crossed that tomorrow brings some info. ",1,417,80
I love all the cat updates lately! ,1,35,7
"Yes, it's very frustrating not knowing anything new about their comeback, let's hope tomorrow more info will be out. I'm just scared it all gets delayed because of all YG legal issues going right now, fingers crossed it won't affect BLACKPINK ü§ûüòî",1,245,42
Thanks a lot!! I will draw the rest of them as well. I hope they will see it too!,1,81,19
"Naw, not really chill. More like mildly warm. Definitely not chill.",1,67,11
Many talented artists are releasing their good works these days before BP's comeback !,1,86,14
um this is AMAZING!!!! I hope you draw the rest of the BP members! they need to see this!,1,89,19
"That's what I've been thinking, having said that if it just hotel promotion what makes it epic?! My heart wants to believe it's to do with the much hoped for comeback, what that would be though is lost on me, my head thinks it's a coincidence. Maybe we're just looking for connections where there are none because the lack of information. ",1,339,61
funniest thing is that she is not even korean :D,1,48,10
I felt like a proud mom when I saw this ad üòÇ,1,44,12
"In just 268 days. What a legend, we stan queen üëèüëèüíû",1,50,11
"Am not surprised, Lisa is a star.",1,33,7
"she's wearing the **Ace Maxi Dress** by **For Love and Lemons,** retailed at **$366**",1,85,14
There is a rumour about this being related to their comback but I think it might just be a collaboration to promote this Hotel. ü§î,1,129,25
I would also prefer pink.,1,25,5
ok thanks,1,9,2
I'm on my phone atm. I'll try to look it up later. ,1,51,12
do you possibly have the link to the financial statement or the article about the sales and earnings? Also thank you for responding,1,131,23
Yes BP are by far the biggest earners for YG atm. Even all 3 comebacks iKON had last year couldn't beat BP's one comeback when it came to album sales.,1,150,30
Is it safe to say blackpink is becoming YG's new cash cow since BigBang is inactive right now? Or are they not there yet? Im asking you since you seem to be really knowledgeable about the overall YG artists,1,206,39
"Hello, I have two P2 tickets section 309 row P for the Forth Worth concert. I'm willing to sale below face value message me your offer. I paid 360 for them. It's for the 5/8 date. I would also be willing to trade for the 5/9 date. Just really need the money atm. ",1,263,53

"Thank you!!! I have one more drawing of Lisa I didn't finish,but after that,in next few months I'll draw the rest of the group too. This one took me about 15 hours to finish",1,173,34
"wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww You are damn talented, do u plan on drawing other members or the whole group, not that u have to, just curious Also how long did it take to draw this?",1,179,32
Oh I don't know this lady but I liked this a lot. I like how she did an English version. I think I'm now interested in D4 in English. ,1,134,29
Curious how to check if it's bots or not? Pretty sure most of my followers are actual human beings.,1,99,19
I think the pink upvote colour is better than green lol,1,55,11
"And yet, here you are.",1,22,5
268 days already!? Time really flies. I was there the first hours they opened the accounts.,1,91,16
"YouTube changed that a while ago. Bot views count up to 300 but after that it will stop. Since all of BP's videos have millions and millions of views, bots don't affect their video. ",1,182,34
"Everyone has bots following their account (if it's not set on private), even back when I had less than 200 followers I had like 50 bots following me out of nowhere. ",1,165,31
It's weird too that itzy is the only one written in both,1,56,12
Awful assumption. ,1,18,2
You're welcome.,1,15,2
when Jennie tripped LMAO,1,24,4
"You kinda sounded like a typical BP hater who got lost on the wrong subreddit, no? ",1,83,16
"Sort of. Both are interfered by bots, viewing manipulation. ",1,60,9
maga fans buy bots tho,1,22,5
"So is the MVs view counts if you used the same logic. Just an irrelevant milestone, no?",1,87,17
"I am chill, he wanted to know why I told him...",1,47,11

"It's a milestone, don't check the post if you're not interested.",1,64,11
"&gt; The rankings are determined every month by analyzing consumer participation, media coverage, interaction, and community indexes of various girl groups. There's a methodology to how they calculate it. Usually when you have a comeback it gives your rankings a big boost. What's amazing is BP has been able to stay at #1 and with a huge gap too without having any comebacks. I'd imagine their points total would go through the roof once they have their comeback. ",1,465,78
Why is tracking Instagram numbers even a thing on this sub? Lol,1,63,12
"Honestly I wasn't until I realised that YG has been inactive on Instagram for 4 days which is unusual. I'm still holding out hope that this BP comeback will still happen as we have had a steady stream of Rtee x Anda content on youtube in this time, although they may not have has choice in that. As for what will happen if YG were to go to prison, honestly nothing a new CEO would be appointed and then business as usual. If you believe the billboard cover story Teddy already has creative control over BP (obviously YG has final say) so it wouldn't be a stretch for them to move under The Black Label as they kind of already are. ",1,631,121
She is the fastest k-pop idol to reach 16M Followers in just 268 Days.,1,70,14
I have the same worries as you ;c also thank you!‚ù§,1,50,11
I'm beginning to get a bit nervous as to whether this fabled comeback is actually going to happen. I'm also concerned that if it does happen we'll only get a handful of songs which will be frustrating. I always like to be grateful for what we get but after thinking about it more and reading between the lines it feels like BP has a secret library full of recorded songs that YG is hording for some unknown reason. I'm probably being paranoid but who knows anymore. Good look with your exam I'm sure you'll do great. ,1,517,96
"I never take these too seriously since I have no idea how they're calculated, but I do remember that early 2018 before DDDD they were hovering between 4th or 6th, quite below other popular groups. And we all know how that comeback played out. This year they're already comfortably 1st so it might be that much bigger.",1,317,57

b/c names like CLC or EXID are just made up words? BlackPink can actually be translated in Korean.,1,98,18
"Does anyone know why it is written in hangul? I see AOA, CLC, and EXID romanized so the makers of the chart can write it as Blackpink. I can never figure this out. Some Korean shows I watch have names, groups, and songs written out one way or the other with almost no consistency. I an understand Gfriend or WJSN since those are using Korean-English translations but if I'm not mistaken, this is actually hangul pronunciation of Blackpink and not the colors black and pink translated.",1,484,86

This was us as well. Did you buy the Day 2 tickets instead of the Day 1 ones? I went ahead and bought a pair of resells for Day 1 because they were so much cheaper for better seats. Couldn't justify buying tickets at face value for Day 2 seeing how cheap they were on Stubhub,1,275,56
A couple days ago üòÑ,1,19,5
"And the upvote button is the light stick, when did this happen?",1,63,12
"Looked at tickets again today to cross examine the tickets I bought for Wednesday. There are so many tickets available. Part of the reason why we went ahead and bought the Wednesday tickets even though the Thursday tickets would have worked better for our schedules is that they were so much cheaper for better seats. At this point, I'm thinking of buying extra tickets for my non-kpop fans to introduce them to BP and fill some seats",1,434,77

what does it mean if a ticket says soundcheck on it. Did i accidentally buy only soundcheck tickets or does that mean i get access to soundcheck and the actual concert. I'm confused since it says soundcheck on it but not GA anywhere on the ticket. Ordered off stubhub for reference,1,281,51

Nope :(,1,7,2
"This has shaken me to my core, I actually got emotional!",1,56,11
I agree with everything you said. But when they release new material... I think that will be what propels them forward or causes their popularity to fade. The next releases will be critical in making sure they're here to stay. ,1,227,40
She‚Äôs so cuteee,1,15,3

The fact that Ros√© hasn‚Äôt posted since she last did in a hair salon is a good sign. All the girls are pretty quiet on social media aside from Jisoo saying that‚Äôs she knows it‚Äôs frustrating about the teasers. Positive vibes. ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®,1,227,42

"Personally,it was just a witchhunt. Jennie did look uninterested in some clips, but the clips people were showing were the same clips and it only showed what? maybe less than 3 minutes of their concert, when their concert was 2 hours long. Jennie deserved some criticism, but a lot of it was too much and not even constructive tbh. After that Jennie improved, but people still see her as ""lazy"" which just shows that people see only what they want to see tbh.",1,459,83
"Never see Blackpink fans be willing to have a discussion about this? Not to be rude, but if you took 2 seconds to search the sub for ""lazy"" or another network relating to this topic, you'd find many people have asked the same question and many people have answered.",1,265,49
"Yes im a bit nervous too because of the news popping up, i hope BP will not be affected by this especially their upcoming comeback",1,130,25
For me it's all nonsense. It's just a witchhunt. It all happened once she released Solo and I guess some fans didn't like the success she had got for the song as it did do better than other songs during a stacked November. It's not a case of defending her for some actions. It's a case of people just being plain mean to someone who hasn't done anything wrong in the first place.,1,379,73
"Anyone else getting a bit nervous about the state of YG since all these news is coming out about him? If true, hopefully he will just get a hefty fine but worst case scenario he gets locked up I wonder what will happen. Maybe Teddy will take over management of BP? The timing of all this just sucks.",1,299,58
"IF this whole drama gets worse and worse and it starts going downhill, I would hope YG would step down ",1,103,20

Stay has been one of my favorite MVs/songs. I've always had so many questions about it and what it meant. This is the best theory and I want it to be true. It's perfect. ,1,170,34
"I sincerely hope that they could have music that touch on social and political topics in the future, and not just love, relationship or things related to romance again and again. For instance, the one featuring Jisoo tripping down in the 4D MV is a smart idea and I look forward to seeing more concepts similar to that.",1,319,58
"I highly suspect that this is because YG is tackling Seungri scandal and related lawsuits. I don't want to think it that way but this should be the truth, very likely.",1,167,31
"""U know people always like to drag Blackpink for having shallow and meaningless musical content"". Of course compared to some groups, they do not really touch on social and political topics, and distinctively connect all their music videos with hidden theories, but I feel like alot of the blackpink MVs are overlooked, and one case is here Stay. A beautiful yet heartbreaking story but is labeled the ""that underrated Blackpink song with campfire vibe, pretty pastel aesthetics"" sometimes. Another example could be ""Whistle"". I read this theory with game console and the fish tanks about how Blackpink is being controlled in a game and even though the theory was not perfect, it still gave me a new outlook on Whistle's MV. Also saw another ""Playing with Fire"" theory about Rosie, Jisoo and Jennie being Lisa's emotions in a toxic relationship, and was quite surprised. So what Im trynna say is that, Blackpink's MVs depend on how you look at them, if you would wanna keep them as ""ligh-hearted MVs with pretty and talented girls and with catchy beats, and iconic lines"" or actually try to connect each set props and lyrics, and the color contrasts (or just simply read already written hidden theories) is purely your decision. I personally think there is a reason for each scene in Blackpink's MVs to be chosen by the producers and directers, even though sometimes I cannot connect them,",1,1388,235

About a week before the show there will be a lot of panic selling, with sellers willing to sell at a loss rather than have to eat the tickets (many are professional scalpers who would never go to any of these concerts). One thing that could go in sellers' favor is how strong of a comeback this expected March comeback is. If tons of new songs, or Rose's solo, combined with positive buzz at their first NA show (Coachella), this could fuel hype/curiosity and sellers will hold firm on price confident they will sell.",1,608,110

"This. I was trying to discuss how this is kinda anomalous since the typical behavior for views versus time is logarithmic in nature.

There‚Äôs a difference between unique views and total views Unique views basically represent an individual person‚Äôs first view of it and is representative of how many individual people stream the song Total views (which is what YouTube counts) can be the same 100 million people listening to the song 7 times - for example So to answer your question - yes all your views count! ,1,376,65

Somebody mentioned in a previous post ""If a foreign language song could make it big in America, you'd see lots of Spanish language songs, but you don't"". For me personally? I definitely prefer what they are doing now. Korean (and Japanese), with some English thrown in here and there so I can actually sing along.

"There is huge demand for the seats. I dont think there will be a problem with the venue filling up by the time the actual concert rolls around. The problem is that the ticket prices originally were ALREADY higher than usual other kpop acts. Especially with the small discography. I know many people just waiting for the ticket prices to drop back to around original price. The problem is that the original price was already high, so people aren't gonna throw out more than double or sometimes triple the original amount when ticket resellers are decreasing prices daily. Since these are also all resell tickets. YG isnt too pressured to push ticket sales because for them, they are already all sold out. I have a feeling if WHYGEE actually dropped some teasers, the ball will get rolling filling up those resell tickets.",1,820,142
"This is not something new, this happens to all major concerts, events. They will sell when the tour dates get closer.

The use "" its been said "" can mean it came from any source, whether it was a comment or a website, theres no specific way to write it, i can even write it as sources state that...

"&gt;It's been said that YG might have to go to jail for supposedly tax envasion. That is the start of your post. There is NO news site stating that. The only people stating that are anti-yg people and they are using this to try to attack Blackpink and other artists over this. It's possible you are asking an innocent question but using rumor with 'It's been said' with no source article implies the same nefarious intent as everyone on social media celebrating as you describe. First Seungri was guilty, then innocent, then guilty of something else. Now YG is guilty. But no one claiming these people are guilty has actual evidence, they are jumping to conclusions based upon partial info leaks. This is why leaks during criminal investigations are bad. Now if someone is actually innocent, everyone will assume they bought their innocence because of these partial info leaks that imply guilt. Conversely, if someone is charged with real evidence, those thinking they are innocent will claim they only charged them because they had to charge somebody after all this noise.",1,1073,181

"I agree with the overall sentiment that we can't fight hate with hate. On the other hand, I feel like we're putting way too much value into the opinions of others. We simply cannot convert people who have an inherent bias against a certain genre or group. We come across as abrasive and just push people the wrong way. I think us as fans are putting way too much emphasis on validating BLACKPINK as the #1 group in the world. The fact that they've made it this far is amazing and should be applauded. Can they be more successful? Sure, but I feel like it further divides our young fandom from appreciating BLACKPINK as artists and musicians and more as a group that puts out good numbers on the charts. Don't get me wrong, I despise the shit other fandoms fling against BLACKPINK and BLINKS. Just plain misinformation into slut-shaming, etc. But as I've become older, I just realize that shit is just short-term pain and it's simply not worth my time. The only thing I can do to defend something is to call them out on misinformation. I feel like BLINKS in general are so obsessed with this sort of validation that we end up trying so hard to fight hate with hate and never are on the same page. It sucks to constantly be hated on by other fandoms, but I really try to go into the mindset of just enjoying BLACKPINK for their music and personalities, despite the infrequent releases. Let that stuff speak for itself on the charts. ",1,1431,262
This hurt so much to read.. I understand how some people feel like it wasn't their best performance. But a lot of it was just hate. Why do people feel the need to comment on a group they don't like?

I've stayed at the Mantra nearby and although it's super convenient to walk to and from the show, I wish I spent the money on a better hotel in the city and paid the $10 for an Uber to get there and back. * Coffee is Melbourne's speciality: cafe culture plays a significant part in everyone's lifestyles here so you'll always find a great place to eat. Laneway Greens is one of my favourite places for breakfast and smoothies. * Only thing to be conscious of is respecting Indigenous Culture. Without being too political, Australia has a dark past and we should be as respectful of Indigenous people as possible. For example, you shouldn't play a didgeridoo (One Direction had a scandal for doing this on stage a few years ago). I'm not really sure of rules around boomerangs but it's worth being conscious of as well. You'd have no problems buying one from any tourist shop, but I'm not sure if they're legitimate or not. I know you're not necessarily planning to go to Uluru, but if you do, please research how to be respectful there as it's very sacred land. &amp;#x200B; I'm afraid I don't know about day trips to take to see Victoria's outback as I'm from Sydney and am only flying to Melbourne for the show!

They're hating Blackpink because they have achieved a level of success that is truly unprecedented, at least for how young they are in the game. Less then 3 years, and getting all of the accolades.

"In one of the recent English language magazine interviews, they said the original versions of their songs they worked on with Teddy started out in English before being converted to Korean. So it would not be anglicizing the songs but reverting to their original form. However, they also said those early demos were terrible in comparison to their song's final form. That is easily believable as the English rap lyrics in the Japanese versions of their songs are a bit cringe-y--but we know they can have great English raps like AIIYL. Seeing the end product of the Japanese conversions makes me doubt we see full English versions.

Ticketmaster has this ""dynamic pricing"" for platinum seats, where they literally held onto seats/floor GA just to sell it at a markup depending on the demand/how many people were looking. So, while the public sale/cheap seats are all gone more or less, the venues at best are not going to be full like some other acts may be. A lot of people were looking to scalp and you can see floor GA going for under retail closer to the day. As of right now, there are still over 800 tickets listed for floor GA for the LA show, and seats have already fallen to $160 ($40 under)",1,660,125
Worked fine for Red velvet. The crowd was able to sing along in the concert with the English versions of their songs lol.,1,121,23
"I think the reason why they didn't use the English ver. of the raps duirng GMA and The Late Show was because of the language (like the rap parts do include some words that you will not hear on U.S. TV programs...). ""Forever Young"" performance on GMA made me believe in this more when they just cut out the rap part (well there was ""says life's a b\*\*\* but mine's a movie""). So, I think for the concert, they might use the English rap parts. Again, since they said in their interview with Billboard, Jennie and Lisa sometimes mix up the the rap parts between Korean and Japanese ver. (Japanese ver. has English part), they may end up using the Korean ver. too.",1,661,123

Don't get me wrong, I fully expect them to really flex their English fluency in their next EP, but those will likely be built from the ground up that way. Plus, BTS made it big in the US by singing in Korean, and while I hate the American media's description of Blackpink as ""The female version of BTS,"" in this case, it's the only truly successful model out there, so I don't see why they wouldn't follow it.",1,527,100
"Highly doubt it. That was something I feared when they were performing on GMA and The Late Show, but they stuck with their KR versions. ",1,136,25
"I don't think they'll be doing English versions of their current library, though I wouldn't dismiss the possibility that they might integrate the English raps from the Japanese versions of their songs (hopefully not 4D lol).

Honestly, it's an open question. This is uncharted territory honestly.",1,492,83

Yeah I picked up a floor ticket for $160 on Stubhub as I'm not seeing floor GA that low on ticketmaster unfortunately.,1,118,22
There are front row level 1 side seats for like $325 for the LA show. Those would be really good seats I‚Äôm not a fan of floor seats so I got side level 1 seats. Looked up the view of the stage on a website and I‚Äôm super happy with the view. It honestly hasn‚Äôt hit me that I‚Äôm going to see them live. ,1,300,64
Its fantastic. I'm not seeing a lot of resale for GA or the really close 1st levels though. So hopefully those are all taken by actual BLINKs. IMO this is great. Might actually be able to get seats at cost. ,1,207,40

"Which solo, hello bitches or the other one, (can't remember the name)? If your talking about the other one, that solo was never really promoted and it was placed on 2ne1 final album. Probably wouldn't have been as popular as solo, but it was drowned out by the group album. Hello bitches, doesn't seem like a song like the Korean public would like, whereas solo was liked more domestically. Also seen as to try hard to international fans. Plus bp have a bigger fandom and Jennie is very popular. Both of CLs solo came at a bad time. CL was seen as the princess of the company, many blackjacks felt as though CLs solo pursuits was placing group activities on the back burn, especially since she wanted to promote in the states which is a lot harder to do and takes a lot of time. Same thing kinda happened when solo was first announced. But out of 2ne1 bom had the most successful solos. ",1,887,164

"If you search kpop reddit there should be an article about it. But despite being from the same company and having similar music styles 2ne1 and blackpink, they have very little connection. They've only really interacted with dara, I don't think the girls have ever mentioned them in an interview (although I'm not 100% sure of that.) Also that they've never covered a 2ne1 song. But that comment really shot the girls in the foot, it made the the general kpop already have a bias against the girls. Made blackjacks even angrier as they felt that the girls have been replaced by prettier versions, especially when 2ne1 who only had one member that would be considered pretty in Korea, built an image around not being conventionally beautiful, basically rejecting the male gaze (hence girl crush) which made blackjacks even less likely to support despite bp having similar music styles.

"Yes, regular GA. Ticketmaster reserves a small portion of tickets at inflated prices and list them as platinum with no extra benefits.",1,134,22

"They were originally called Pink Punk. The other girls were Miyeon (now with G-Idle), Kim Eunbi, Euna Kim, Jang Hanna, and Jinny Park. Over the years, they either left, were let go, or were transferred to a different project group leaving only the 4 current members of Blackpink.",1,279,48
What other girls were supposed to being BLACKPINK? And wasn't this when they were originally called Team A?,1,107,18
2NE1 members have stated in the past that YG would constantly tell them they‚Äôre ugly to the point where they started to get low self esteem about it. Which is why some people speculate why Bom had plastic surgery done. YG also has a lengthy history of sabotaging his ggs. In the end thought BP was suppose to have more members (it‚Äôs rumored that they were suppose to be his rendition of a ‚ÄòYG style SNSD‚Äô) but trainees were gradually let go/left due to a number of reasons as well as both groups having similar vibes and producer so it might be a bit of a stretch to consider them 2NE1‚Äôs replacements. ,1,602,112

Were they really left overs? randoms online mentioned that As If It's Your Last was a song from 2NE1's summer comeback the year BLACKPINK debuted,1,145,25
That‚Äôs the connection really that‚Äôs it. Also some of their songs sound a lot like 2ne1 leftover songs- because Teddy produced for both 2ne1 and Blackpink. ,1,155,26

"It‚Äôd be interesting to see how much the comeback (if it even happens in time) shifts price, supply &amp; demand, because all the hardcore fans will have already secured tickets. For the price to go up, BP would need to convince non-fans or more casual, ‚Äúon the fence‚Äù fans to buy tickets, and I don‚Äôt know the size of that population compared to those who already got tickets. If BP doesn‚Äôt do anything to grab attention, I‚Äôd predict the price to fall or stay the same.",1,469,86
"The difference between the DVD sets (goodies aside) is basically Set 1 includes some multi angle stuff and the Blink tribute video, right? Other than that it's just the bottle vs photo book/cd?

"When it comes to the Korean perspective, Red Velvet can match up with BP very evenly, if not even surpass BP in some aspects of talent. In that regard, I would agree with you; RV can be the revolution as much as BP is. However, BP's secret weapon comes from their Western appeal imo. Besides BTS, out of every single k-group out there, BP has the best shot at wooing the West because of their sound as well as the individual member backgrounds (tbh I think BP has way more Western appeal than even BTS; I think BTS got lucky in their Western debut and is now snowballing into this unstoppable K-pop force because they were the first to really break through but I digress). So I guess, it's just how you define being the revolution as. ",1,735,137

"If they predict prices will drop even further, then they would want to sell now since a small loss is still better than a bigger loss",1,133,26
"Second shows should definitely help make it more of a buyer's market, although I wondered about something: Floor tickets for LA has fallen below face value ($198.50) on stubhub. Although I realize the buyer will still be hit with like 33% fees, why is the scalper listing it for so low? If listed at $190, stubhub will take 10% so the scalper only stands to ""make"" $171 (meaning lose $27.50). Does anyone know why they would do this?",1,433,78
"It's always the music imo. Just unique and Teddy doesn't miss with his title tracks. I also think timing played a factor as well. There was a void when 2NE1 disbanded and many GG's didn't have the same concept as BLACKPINK. Don't get me wrong, the girls are very talented coming from YG. They came in with a fresh concept. It was definitely girl crush, but the personalities of the girls was unique to YG. Fierce, yet innocent off-stage not understanding how harsh the music industry outside of the music (the hate, the bureaucracy, pressure). I couldn't help but root for them because of it. Musically, they're very unique individually. Each member shines in their own way and their teamwork is imppecable. ",1,708,122

It's not just 1 or 2 songs, it's all of their songs which cater to the West. It's probably why they've already broken through the west after 2 years of debuting. BP aren't my favourite group.

"You could say that. Because they make music that can be played in the west because some of their music, like Boombayah &amp; D4, are pretty westernized. They make music that caters to the west and music that is more for the local scene (Whistle, Forever Young). Best of both worlds.",1,282,51

Exactly. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt buy tickets for Newark when they initially sold out since stub hub prices are closer to face value now. I actually think they could go below face value because of these second dates. Scalpers will not go after these new dates because the resale is terrible right now. ,1,295,53
"On the bright side, Fort Worth and Newark ticket prices for the first date will take a big hit. And while scalpers will still go for the day 2 tickets, as economics dictates, increasing the overall supply of tickets will drop prices for both dates. ",1,249,45
"i recommend using seatgeek and signing up.   You get $20 off your first purchase, its a reliable site, and the prices fluctuate a lot so you can get a good ticket for under or even the same amount as it was sold as. I got my ticket for LA around a week after they were sold out for $302 for GA soundcheck and a couple days later it dropped to $236. ",1,349,71

The members that finish can do solo work but if youtube views are to be a gauge their popularity has waned. BB can't come back until 2021 at the earliest, so it would be interesting to see BP move into bread winner position, I think we may already be seeing it with the world tour, the deal with interscope and the promise of 2 comebacks and all the solos this year (how true that is only time will tell).

"I can maybe answer 2 questions that havent really been answered yet. How are they different from Jpop idols? Well, for one I find J-pop doesnt really put a huge emphasis on vocals or choreography, rather they rely more on visuals and personality. In kpop though, it ALL matters. There's more of an emphasis on visuals too, but especially on dancing. The structure of groups also seems to be different. In K-pop eveeybody has a specific role. There's always at least 2 members with strong vocals, and maybe 1 or 2 rappers in the group, at least 1 really good dancer, 1 person whos variety, 1person who is the beauty etc. K-pop idols also have a no dating rule, but this becomes more lenient as they get older. K-pop idols also train significantly longer, usually 4+ years before they debut, and as a result i find the debut age is older vs J-pop idols, so you'll also find less ""school girl"" cute in K-pop. Groups also change style way way more. They'll have ballads, or a cool ""concept"" one day, and then sexy the next, and maybe a cute concept after that. They'll have a dance edm, and then acoustic ballad the next. Most groups have a stylistic sound, but the concepts ans song ""vibes"" pretty much constantly change. Also, if you're looking for a similar artist to Blackpink, i would recommend 2NE1 (now disbanded RIP). They're from the same label as BP, and are BP's predecessor. There are some bp songs that were originally 2NE1 songs, and the song structure is really similar.",1,1481,264

"When traveling, I'll pretty much try anything to take in a culture, as well as, all the touristy stuff. I definitely need to see some animals while there (the closer the better).

My friend might join me and he really wants to see the outback, but not necessarily Uluru. Is there any landscape on the outskirts that imitate that kind of setting? And the biggest thing I need to know is the best food joints to try out.",1,543,102

"Ahh. Ok. You meant more then questions than the answer. I took ""They're more free in the west"" to mean that they were free to answer similar questions less... politically, for lack of better term, than they would if they were in Korea. Not that they wouldn't haven even had the opportunity to answer due to the question never getting asked. My mistake. Sorry.",1,359,64
I didn't say Koreans cared or would cause a fuss if she said she cried. In fact they probably feel for her. It's more about that line of questioning doesn't get asked in interviews b/c it's not appropriate in public. ,1,217,40
Oooh that one is so cool. I will definitely show that to her. Thanks :),1,71,15
"I mean, there's accepted the adopting of customs and then there's reaction to a statement.

Hell if that's the case then just hold all your press conferences in international waters and avoid all repercussions lmao. ",1,405,71
b/c the culture in the US is different so Koreans expect that? It's respectful and appropriate to adopt another culture's customs when you visit their country. If you were a westerner you wouldn't act the same way visiting Korea and vice versa. So Koreans back at home criticizing BP who are in the US wouldn't have any grounds to do so.,1,337,61

"I get that, I guess I'm just asking why Rosie feels its ok to say that she cried to Billboard but not at an interview in Korea. Basically, it's ""I can't answer x question with y answer in Korea."" I just don't see why they feel they CAN outside of Korea. It's not like their answer doesn't make it back to Korean audiences. ",1,323,63
wow Jennie is gorgeous.,1,23,4
It's not about going out of your way to be rude or controversial. It's more about it being inappropriate in Korea to complain or share your personal feelings in public. For instance Rosie saying she cried during her trainee years and saying how tough it was on her. That's the first time we've ever heard of it. In Korea the company expects you to maintain an image and cause the least amount of controversy. So if you have personal problems you don't share it. Idol interviews in Korea feels very safe and generic where as in the West the girls can express how they really feel in certain situations and westerners tend to connect with that more b/c it makes the artists feel human.,1,683,124
Why does it matter where they are though? Does the Korean press/media/netizens give them a pass for saying/doing things abroad that they would slam them for at home? ,1,166,28
She can pull off any color palette..,1,36,7
Jennie from AIIYL with the ice cream cone with the lips haha ,1,61,12
"Yeah b/c the culture is differen't, it's more conservative in asia. They're more free over here and Jennie said they want to show that side of themselves and be less afraid to make mistakes. It's one of the keys that will make them successful is be genuine and not be robotic.",1,276,51
I felt that this and the cover story have already provided more depth to the girls than their Asian interviews combined. Their North American interviews are so relaxed and laid back; a nice change of pace. ,1,206,36
Wow. This was better than the cover story IMO. ,1,47,9
"**Mood:** Sigh...I'm pretty stressed at the moment. So can someone just listen to my story/rant? **Here's the sitch** I'm trying to sell BlackPink 2019 World Tour tickets but I'm afraid no one will buy them in time. During the day/time the tickets went out, I was busy so I had my sister try and get me and my roommate tickets. She was also getting tickets for herself and a friend, so it was no big deal. But my sister is too naive. We ended up getting 3 pairs of tickets! I didn't really want her to get expensive tickets, and would have rather not get any if they were to high (b/c I'm just a broke college student and she's just a broke high school student). But she went and did just that, didn't even bother consulting or texting me or updating me or anyone. **More Problems \[YAY -\_-\]** I know what you're thinking, ""What's the problem, you got tickets."" Yeah well no the situation is a mess. The friend that was going to go to the concert with her backed out; her mom got mad at her because the tickets were a hefty price (side note: they got GA) so she's not able to go. First, I'm kinda like, *gurl*, why you no consult with your mom BEFORE BUYING. She must have known the prices!! &gt;\^&lt; And my dude, it's not even like she has to bare with the burden of the expenses b/c she's not even going to pay us now. Second, here comes a plot twist, the ""friend"" my sister was going with is one of MY close friends, so basically she grown so should definitely know better and have better control of her expenses. AND SO my sister doesn't want to go because she lost her companion. Anyway, the next problem was that me and my roommate don't want our tickets anymore (other details as to why omitted). But regardless of wether we all go or not, that still leaves one pair of tickets to resolve (remember I said we had 3 pairs?). Like I understand its stressful when your trying to buy tickets (I've done it before too), but she did a couple other things that I'm still upset about (omitting b/c its too long to explain). Oh and to boot she used my mom's card so now my mom has a giant rip in her wallet (which I'm totally pissed about). **Conclusion** SO BASICALLY, I'm trying to get the money back. Anyone interested? lol Thank you for sitting through my horribly explained rant\~",1,2287,429

"I know I'm breaking the unspoken ""Don't comment after 24 hours"" rule, but I think you and I are on the same page. I'm also a metal fan who somehow fell in love with Blackpink (and Lisa), and that helped me uncover a lot of K-Pop I never knew existed. If you're looking for something with more of an alternative sound, I can help with that. First and foremost, [""Crazy"" by 4Minute](  Without this song, there might not be a Blackpink. And, since you're already listening to ""Crazy,"" you might as well try, [""Hate""](  \- a song so alternative, 4Minute actually had to apologize for it. It also became one of their biggest hits. In my opinion, it's the greatest K-Pop song of all time. Next, try, [""Holup!"" by Bobby](  And you can't go wrong with [""Hero"" by Monsta X](  Or any Monsta X song, really. They're great. Of course, you'll need some [""Roll Deep"" by HyunA](  And, lastly, give [""Zero for Conduct"" by Bastarz](  a whirl. I realize I've bombarded you with a lot of music you never asked for, but, if you're hooked on Blackpink, I have a feeling you'll appreciate a selection of songs with some bite to them.",1,1111,202

I've so been enjoying these diaries! I must say though I thought it was so cute with Jisoo's bunny. When I was younger I went on more vacation trips with my parents and always had stuffed animals and yeah the hotel staff would always play around with it and making it look cute. I just loved her giggling over that and it brought back my own nice memories with it.,1,364,70
"I can't choose either! Jennie hooked me from the outside, then I decided to binge watch BlackPink house thinking it might help me narrow it down..

"Correct. The 'In Your Area' one has ecery song including ones from square up, it has the words 'In Your Area' all over it to differentiate it tho.",1,146,28

"That's exactly the reason I was talking about too. I actually want that as well, because I want every song in Japanese and English. The actual album is called ""blackpink in your area"" on eBay. And make sure you're getting it in the box.",1,236,44

And also, it would be my first time arriving to the stadium, would they let me in even if i were late? Help pls",1,402,80
"Sorry for the super long reply, hope I gave you enough info about it. The black box one is slightly cheaper, but both will run you between $40 to $80. And make sure you get them in the limited edition boxes, because just the CD of both only comes with the Japanese songs.",1,271,53
"EBay is probably the best place for that. The EP you are talking about is a Japanese release. The one with only the CD only comes with the Korean songs. If you get the version in the pink box called "" blackpink in your area"", it comes with two CDs and DVD. The second CD has every song from all three blackpink albums in Korean. And the DVD has all of the music videos in Japanese I believe. There is another box that is black that is just called 'blackpink', that I believe is similar, but only has songs from their first two albums, seeing as square up didn't come out yet.",1,575,112

I see you already mentioned you're hooked. I recommend their reality show Blackpink House if you haven't seen it yet! And they have a current series going on too with Blackpink Diaries. As far as J idols I don't know anything about them to compare them or not. And since you mentioned liking J rock I would recommend the Kpop group Dreamcatcher. They have a pop/rockish type of sound. I think their sound is unique anyways. I know Rose plays guitar and Jennie in a diary mentioned she helped with writing 'Stay' but I don't know if it's been told what that exactly means? And yes I too am a fan of metal and rock music (especially 80's rock)!,1,642,119
Thank you for sharing this. I love interactions like this a bit more than your typical sit down interview. Those are nice too but I feel like with these video's you're getting to see them a bit more with their personalities and I enjoy that a lot. ,1,248,47

Hate is a strong word and most of the scandals you have stated have no credibility. If other BlackPink members love her I see no reason to hate her. Hating someone for petty stuffs and no concrete evidence is a disease. Look at her positives not her faults.,1,257,48

"Korea and Japan and Asia will probably always be their main and profitable region and the region they'll pay most attention too. Blackpink are still foreign artists and are still relatively ""new"". There's an estimated 60 million Spanish speakers in the US and Latin music and besides a few big names Latin music and artists is still somewhat niche. Despactio probably wouldn't have been as big of a hit without Justin beieber on the track. Unless they get a #1 hit or sell Taylor swift levels on the next ep in the US, they'll probably balance between east and west. (Off topic) this probably why YG is keeping cl in the dungeon, she wants to promote solely in the US but he knows that they'd make more profit with promotions in Korea and Japan/SEA. Also with GD scandal he was only moved because his roommate was basically spying on him and sent it to his girlfriend. Detailing his habits, injuries and even his medication, I think even relvead he was on anti depressants. Unless something else happened with GD that I'm unaware of. ",1,1034,183

They're main focus is I. Korea and if they so happen to get big in the West, then theyll let things happen as they come. The girls will be fine in Korea. Also this is off-topic, but I really don't think BIGBANG is finished. If nothing comes of the investigation and Seungri enlists scandal free until his release BIGBANG will be fine. GD's army thing turned out to be a joke of a scandal. This is his yearly ""let's shit on GD"" moment. Nothing will change in regards to his popularity. ",1,674,124

"Their main target market will ALWAYS be korea, because of their heritage and fan demographics. Their 2nd market will be Japan (in terms of revenue probably 1st). If they go fully western, you would see 100% english songs, so little kids can understand them, they need to live in the USA to perfect the language for media. Kpop is not just music though.

"Hope this helps, didn't have time to proofread or anything. 1. Yep they are idols. i don't know much about jpop but basically they had to audition for their companies and then be trainees for 4-5 years before debuting as a group. 2. Formed though auditioning to YG Entertainment and training for years. Jisoo- Oldest, 24 (pronounced gee-soo), Korean, lead vocal and visual (will explain what roles mean later on), known to be the crazy one with a 4-dimensional personality, fake maknae (maknae is the youngest of the group, this means she acts like a maknae sometimes). Jennie- 23, Korean but studied in New Zealand so is fluent in English, main rapper, vocal, fashionista, sponsored by Chanel, fierce on stage but soft off stage, has a solo song that came out recently. Ros√©- 22, (pronounced Rose-ay, nickname Rosie), main vocal, lead dancer, Australian (native English speaker), amazing voice and super soft, queen of capturing people with her elegance when speaking English, loves food. Lisa- 21, Thai, main dancer, lead rapper, didn't know korean before becoming a trainee, fluent in English, maknae, cute goofball and amazing dancer, happy virus off stage hardcore on stage. 3. Blackpink is probably a good place to start for English speakers as they're almost all fluent. 4. Pop, EDM, Hip hop elements. Basically combination of vocals, raps, and hard-hitting choruses. Performances are great, they have cool choreos and do different song and dance covers. Really good stage presence for only 4 members. 5. They mostly don't write/produce songs, but they have a lot of say in the creative process, as they said in a recent billboard interview. I think they took part in composing the song stay and Jennie in her solo song. Ros√© plays guitar and piano, Lisa the ukulele. 6. Mini-albums or EPs: Square One, Square Two, Square Up. All overall the same genre I described before. Sq One: Boombayah (club song), Whistle (relaxed and cool). Sq Two: Stay (ballad), Playing with Fire (long rap, mellow but cool chorus). Sq Up: Ddu-du Ddu-du (hard-hitting chorus, rap break), Forever Young (more vocal focused and light), Really (Carribean vibes), See U Later (break up song and the chorus goes hard) 7. I think it being Kpop in general is what sets it apart first and foremost. The quality of kpop is on a whole other level from western music, you have amazing music videos, high fashion, catchy choreo, songs you can vibe to. Other than that, the girls all share a lot of instagram photos, pull of the girl crush vibe amazingly, are humble, and talented in rap, dance, and song. Very charismatic too. 8. They have more or less equal distribution. For the roles, Main&gt; Lead. Main typically has better range in that skill than lead, but both get time to shine. Jennie and Lisa are the only ones who rap and sing, Jisoo and Ros√© solely sing. Lisa is the best dancer. Visual means they're the ""face"" of the group technically. All the girls can really sing and dance though.",1,2969,506
"I think you're heavily underestimating BIGBANG and how big they really are. And at the same time overestimating the impact of these 'scandals'. First, BIGBANG aren't just another kpop group. They are by far the most successful kpop group in Korea and no one is even close, individually and as a group. GD is arguably the most successful male soloist in Korea in the past decade. A scandal to the least popular member like this isn't going to hurt as much as you think. Much of this is just overblown stuff, many people are taking 'knetz' way too seriously, They are a minority of online people that are usually heavily invested and are just like random people on social media such as Twitter or Reddit. Yes, they will make noise. But they aren't representative of what the vast majority of people think because the vast majority of people literally don't care about stuff like this. If a popular singer in the US got into some scandal 95% of people living here wouldn't know. Because the vast majority of people don't care what some random singer does. People in general want to see justice, but people aren't bothered to follow what every singer does or keep up with celebrity drama. Seungri is the least popular member and much of this is overblown. The GD thing is a bigger issue but even then it's overblown and frankly most people don't care, even if a bunch of people online make some noise.",1,1397,249

"Hello! Hope it helps **Who are the members? What are their personalities like and how did they form?** The members are Jisoo, Jennie, Ros√© and Lisa Here is a video that can give you an idea of their personality: [  From [Inside Blackpink's U.S. Takeover](  &gt;The group‚Äôs members came to Seoul from all over the world starting in 2010 to take part in YG‚Äôs rigorous recruitment and training process. The company and its competitors hold tryouts both within and far beyond Korea (Ros√© traveled to Sydney from her home in Melbourne), seeking recruits who are typically preteens or teens, ethnically Korean and fluent in the language, though these qualities are not mandatory. Lisa, who auditioned in her native Thailand in 2010, didn‚Äôt speak any Korean when she began training in Seoul in 2011. &gt; &gt;For all four women, joining YG meant enrolling in a kind of full-time pop-star academy that Jennie calls ‚Äúmore strict than school‚Äù and that Ros√© likens to *The X Factor* with dorm rooms. For 12 hours a day, seven days a week, the future members of Blackpink -- along with, by Jennie‚Äôs estimate, 10-20 other aspiring singers who cycled through the project -- studied singing, dancing and rapping, taking part in monthly tests designed to identify their strengths and weed out subpar trainees. ‚ÄúSomebody would come in with a piece of paper and stick it on a wall, and it would say who did best, who did worst, who‚Äôs going home,‚Äù recalls Jennie, whom YG initially steered toward rapping because she spoke fluent English. ‚ÄúYou get a score -- A, B, C,‚Äù Lisa explains. ‚ÄúLisa would always get A‚Äôs for everything,‚Äù adds Jennie with a laugh. &amp;#x200B; Here are some videos you might want to check out Whistle at university festival - [  Solo + DDDD + Forever Young - [  Sure thing cover - [ ",1,1787,310
"I‚Äôll try my best! 1) yes they are considered Idols, idk how they differ from Japan. 2) Jisoo (24)- part of the vocal line, known as the ‚Äúvisual‚Äù of the group. Her personality is so unique and she‚Äôs such a goof ball. Jennie (23?)- rap and vocal line, definitely the more well known trainee before debuting. She‚Äôs pretty quiet, seems like a bad ass but she‚Äôs actually super sweet and has a soft personality. Ros√© (22)- part of the vocal line and main dance line. Ros√© loves food, she can play guitar and piano. She was born in NZ but grew up in Australia, so she has a cute accent. She‚Äôs my bias. Lisa (21)- dance line and rap line. She‚Äôs an amazing dancer, just look up her YG academy dance video. She‚Äôs my bias wrecker for sure. 3) I do think BP is a good place to start, there sound is definitely more westernized than other Kpop girl groups. BP is where I started and now I love Twice, RV, most soloists, Weki Meki, Gidle. 4) they are what you call a ‚Äúgirl crush‚Äù concept. More sexy, more hip hop/pop influenced. Complete opposite of Twice‚Äôs ‚Äúcute‚Äù concept. 5) this is kind of unknown if this have a say in lyrics/instrumental. Jennie once made a comment about their song STAY that makes me think that they have a say in lyrics but this isn‚Äôt confirmed. 6) they do not have a full album yet, only square 1 and square 2 (both with two songs each) and then Square Up which is their mini album with 4 songs. I would say sound wise it‚Äôs pretty consistent, though Square Up has more of a beachy vibe to it. 7) I find them unique in the Kpop setting, and Kpop is unique on its own. The collabed with Dua Lipa, that song is the only ‚Äúwesternized‚Äù song that they have in my opinion. 8) no one is the lead singer, Jisoo and Ros√© are knows as the ‚Äúlead vocalists‚Äù but Jennie has a pretty unique sounding voice so I don‚Äôt like to count her out. I‚Äôm sorry if I got some details wrong. And there soooo much more to say.

I listened to no J-pop or K-pop at all, unless you count hearing anime op and endings. But a co-worker listens to J-pop and I was curious and found K-pop/Blackpink instead.

"I didn't find the performance lacking, but I think those who criticized it should take into consideration that this might have been the first time the girls performed in that kind of environment. They're used to performing on a big stage where they have elevated above the audience, whereas with GMA they were on a smaller stage and slightly below the audience, which was in closer proximity than what they're probably used to. People say ""they're not rookies, they should be used to performing by now"" but I can see how a different format would be a little disorienting for them. All that aside though? I just rewatched it on Youtube and I don't get where they were lacking. They're all hitting the dance moves hard and making eye contact with the cameras like they were born in front of one. I might need someone to break down specifically, at what exact moment, they are performing poorly because I reaaally really don't see it with a single one of them. Pretty sure this is just a ""haters gonna hate"" situation.",1,1015,180
I lice how the girls are so supportive of Jisoo when she speaks English. I think they know she is not comfortable about it so when she puts herself out there they show her their appreciation.

"Can we please stop dwelling on the negativity? There are so many positive things for us to look forward to and so many reasons to be optimistic. Let me tell you something. I watched the NHL All Star game a few weeks ago. Not sure if you're into hockey, but Sidney Crosby is regarded as one of the best players of all time. When Sid went out on the ice, he was met with loud boos from the crowd (other players were cheered). Know what he did? Laughed it off, went out there and kicked ass, his team won, and he ended up winning the MVP award that night...which he accepted, to more boos, with a smile on his face. We can't control what other people think or say, we can only control our own reactions to them. Continuing to get offended and take negative comments personally is not a productive use of time or energy. Instead, focus that energy on being excited and supportive about all of the great things that are coming for BP. Stop feeding into the negativity. ",1,964,181

If YG don't produce more music with them and do more collabs etc they are wasting away huge potential. This group has the potential to become the biggest gg ever if YG really wanted. But people are already kinda getting bored by them nowadays because of lack of songs and the performing of same songs on live stages. And it looks like even the members are getting tired of doing the same songs live that's why their stage presence is underwhelming sometimes. As of now yg is sabotaging BP. But I hope they release fire ass songs for their supposed comeback on March and change all this. ,1,587,107
Oh wow well spotted. You're probably right,1,42,7

Lisa is slowly but surely getting more comfortable with showing her English! ,1,77,12

"It's a straw man argument trick. 'I'm a fan but this is bad' style comment to try to trick people into thinking fans are turning against someone. This is done by 'dirty tricksters' all the time during elections. The whole 'Jenny is Lazy' thing was started by a non-Blackpink fan but they pretended to be one by claiming 'I want my Jennie' back and continued the pretense by adding 'This is not intended to spread hate' to the comments of the video. It's very obvious when they post no videos until that specific one and they won't even use their real voice in the video. Now, if that account had been posting videos and reactions with their own face and voice for months or years in support of Blackpink and THEN posted the 'lazy' video, then you could say a fan turned sour. This was clearly a hit job by haters and trolls. Same as the comments in the highly publicized US appearance vids.",1,890,164

"&gt; it says extra seats (restricted view) were opened due to high demands I believe this is only marketing lol &amp;#x200B; The reason why I say that Taipei sales are particularly bad is because there are particularly more free ticket campaigns held in Taiwan, as shown from Facebook and other major websites in Taiwan. In fact, even in Hong Kong, Singapore, The Philippines, and Indonesia, free tickets had been offered by various local brands. To face the issue, this is also one of the major attacking points from BP haters",1,527,90
"Yeah most likely they didn't sell out but I don't think it did that terribly, they're just releasing 5 clips of 15 seconds of the girls inviting people to their concert, it's not like a huge desperation move either.

"Looked it up, and it says the NTSU Arena has a seating capacity of 15,000 so yeah it is pretty big.

"The NTSC arena in Taipei is actually quite big. K-pop groups like BB, BTS, iKON, Winner performed there before. I am pretty sure it is even ""bad"" in ticket sales.... &amp;#x200B; And for discussion-wise, according to my observations, BP attracts many haters in the Mainland China and Taiwan. The discussions in Weibo and PTT (something like reddit in Mainland China and Taiwan respectively) are always very mad, with tons of negative and hateful comments. Maybe this is one of the reasons (?)",1,492,82
"Agreed. I think the Taipei concert is the only tour that was not sold out :/ it‚Äôs actually confusing for me since blinks from around the world go to different countries to see them perform but the Taiwan concert still didn‚Äôt sell as much. I don‚Äôt think the fan sites are also going, considering fan sites such as Forever Young (Ros√©‚Äôs) went to almost all places. ",1,363,66
"To be honest, it is quite sad and worrying to see that they have to make these videos before the Taipei concert, whereas they didn't have to do so for concerts in other places.

Like before some fans like me even found out about those videos people were already concern trolling in the comments. Not sure what is going on there but it didn't seem like your usual response to those videos. Now with that said, people have been criticizing BP for their presumed lack of energy ever since they started promoting DDDD. I just think it's not a choreo that translate well to a small studio (but really shines in live concert with the band) so I'm not surprised that 9 months later people still find it underwhelming. As someone who've been following all their performance though, I thought their Colbert and GMA ones were among the better ones, especially because the audio playback was way lower than usual and you could hear them fine. Just a bummer that the studio was so small, especially on Colbert.",1,1045,183

I can't go because of work, but am dying to see the show. So I was hoping if by chance it was livestreamed, I could get together with some like minded Blinks in the SF bay area and watch it with them.",1,367,73

"Can someone who purchased tickets for either the Atlanta or Fort Worth shows through AXS explain what the magic sauce is to get that website to accept a credit card?

I tried calling AXS, but was told that AXS Premium tickets cannot be sold over the phone.",1,418,76
I don't like them because they're bad at singing.,1,49,9
Does anyone know where this show is happening? I happen to be in Paris on that day and I‚Äôd love to see them in person ,1,118,25

Fans got pissed DJ Snake only followed Lisa on instagram and berated him telling him to follow all of the members. He eventually got annoyed by blinks flooding all of his instagram posts and yelling at him so he unfollowed Lisa.,1,228,41
"Fair enough. I don't think I would've characterized the performance that way, but to each their own I guess. I thought her rendition was pure art. But everyone has their preferences :) Like you, I'm always on the look out for great BP covers. Hope they keep em coming. ",1,269,49

"Dj üêç thing was pure stupid but i think it was certainly because of the fake collab news. From my perspective, i think blink see it this way- 'He is going to have a collab with Blackpink and why follow only Lisa when he's collaborating with the team'. It was proper delusional, overthinking and immature though. I don't think people will attack Kehlani (i hope) because i don't see them attacking Halsey when she followed Ros√©.",1,426,76

"I didn't want to name names but yes, that is one of the ones I've heard. 90% of that song is just monotone with an occasional emphasis on every 20th or 30th word like 'fire'. Yes, the last 10% sounds nice but...the beginning and middle are not good. She did what she had to, give them a memorable ending, and she won. Repeatedly. I'm just not a fan of her singing style. Sorry. I like dynamics from start to finish like Solji did her second time around on KoMS.",1,461,89

"Honestly, I've never heard a good Blackpink cover. I don't understand why no one seems able to sing their songs well. It's often the Jisoo part that gets messed up the most as they don't seem able to go low to high like she does. I would say this singer has a great voice and probably a good idea to slow it down for her voice but still not a fan of this cover. It's definitely, worlds better than the slowed down Hyuna Red cover last year; that woman trashed one of my favorite kpop songs.",1,490,96

"They've been on plenty of variety shows (Idol Room, Weekly Idol, Knowing Bros, Running Man, etc.) Also they have their own reality show in BlackPink House which has 48 episodes and some extras. I'm not meaning it as an insult but you're taking it that way. The question was merely if there was a role for ""No-Jam"" who would have that role in your group? I can confidently say from all the interactions, shows, and videos i have seen online that Jennie is the least talkative and is the most ""No-Jam"". If you're a real blink you wouldn't even be trying to deny this, unless you don't want to admit it because you think it's inherently negative.",1,643,117

That's so true. BIGBANG was when I started Kpop but I just listened to them casually since my gf was into them. It was only when I stumbled onto BP that I really got into Kpop. Then from just following them it exposed me to other Kpop music that I wouldn't have discovered myself. BP is still my #1 group but I can appreciate the music other Kpop artists put out. I think ppl need to realize BP and BTS is everywhere now and has become part of mainstream music. It's so easy to stumble into their music and then soon go down the rabbit hole and discover other Kpop artists either by yourself or through social media algorithms that recommend you more Kpop.,1,656,124

"Okay so I have a few on my wishlist which is probably not gonna happen: 1. Really dark concept and a MV with hidden meanings, or just MV with black and white effect, but then again any MV with Blackpink is stunning. 2. I want Teddy to experiment with different sounds such as tropical house, dream pop etc 3. One side track could be RnB and another one could be a ballad or a slow paced acoustic track, and it would be amazing if the title track is a mix of trap, hip hop and pop (I would be eternally grateful). But then again, I know Stay did not do that well in charts, and is really underrated, so Blackpink might not include that kind of song. 4. At least let Jennie and Lisa write their own raps (people like to drag them for not always writing their raps, but like we know they can, from what we have seen from the Sure Thing cover), and bring the ""Special-Lee-Hi"" Jennie back, because her rapping there is just wow coming from a 13-year-old kid. 5. Also let Jisoo try rapping once in a while. I know she needs proper training and years of work, but she really has the potential to become a sub rapper (highly unlikely since there are two members out of four that rap, and she does not even get lines now, when she is the lead vocalist, so yeah I'm being too unrealistic) 6. Let Chaelisa have a dance break 7. Bring iconic choreographies like Boombayah's, and yes I know the ""hit-you-with-that-dududu"" part was iconic, but I was a bit disappointed with the overall choreographies. 8. Lisoo harmonizing is actually really nice, so Teddy should utilize it more in the songs instead of always using them in the background (Chaennie's is good too but I just prefer Lisoo's because of all the background vocals harmonization and the iconic Playing with Fire harmonization they did) 9. Have two members in one scene like Whistle's scene, or while one is singing, the others are there dancing 10. LISA WITHOUT BANGS OR AT LEAST BLACK HAIR WITH BANGS, I SAW AN EDIT SHE LOOKED SO STUNNING 11. ROSIE WITH JET BLACK HAIR PLEASE, SHE LOOKED SO HOT IN THOSE PREDEBUT PICS 12. JENNIE WITH SHORT HAIR SINCE SHE CANNOT DYE HER HAIR, AND WE WANNA SEE HER TRY SOMEHING DIFFERENT CAUZ SIS BASICALLY HAD THE SAME HAIRSTYLE FOR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS NOW 13. JISOO WITH PLATINUM BLONDE HAIR BISHES SHE WILL WRECK YOUR BIASES [  14. and most importantly as long as the girls love what they are doing, i know that we blinks will love this comeback",1,2436,451

Yeah you have to go via Live Nation‚Äôs website as that contains a special link that contains the pre-sale code to Ticketek. Otherwise it won‚Äôt let you actually purchase.,1,168,29

It took an hour of refreshing before I secured tickets. Somebody on twitter told me to keep refreshing and it eventually worked.,1,128,22
Hmm... well that‚Äôs really all I know tbh so one can assume the presale has sold out I‚Äôm afraid... They did state that presale tickets were limited but you‚Äôll have another chance on March 1st. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt be of help :(,1,222,42
Exactly! Hope they could even sing a Cantonese song someday like what IU has done before by singing Kay Tse's song!,1,115,21

Is there any BP official merch for men?,1,39,8
Did you login on Live Nation‚Äôs page and then used the ticket link on their page? It should work after it redirects you to Ticketek ,1,131,25

I got to the page that showed all the tickets and their prices but there was no button that I could click to continue the purchase ,1,131,26
I speak Cantonese and it‚Äôs actually fun listening to them attempting to speak. üòÑ,1,80,14
I had the same problem as well when trying to buy tickets for Sydney but for me it was more so people holding the tickets without actually buying them rather than the tickets being sold out. I managed to get 3 Pink VIP tickets after waiting a bit after the holders‚Äô timer expired.,1,280,53
"1. They been doing the same set list at each concert? Anybody got a link to one? 2. Anybody have experience with merch shipping to Australia, official or non official? 3. Anybody been to a concert yet that knows how early the merch lines were open beforehand?",1,259,47

this isn‚Äôt an insult to them. i‚Äôm not saying their dances need to be more tiring i‚Äôm just saying they have the potential to do a lot better choreography and their choreographer needs to amp it up. they make it look good and entertaining because they‚Äôre good dancers but they can easily do more. ,1,295,54
The dances aren't suppose to be challenging so fans can do it too. How do you think DDDD dance is so iconic and recognizable? Plus they have to sing while dancing so their voice needs to be stable.,1,197,38

"I honestly know this a reach and probably won't ever happen but I'd really love a hard hitting, full on hip hop track and just let Jennie and Lisa go off.

was it really? i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve seen it yet or heard of it being confirmed. i‚Äôll take your word for it though! those photos looked so cool too. it would‚Äôve been interesting to see what concept they‚Äôre gonna come out with. ,1,224,42

"I actually have no specific wishes really, other than maybe getting another ""black"" side as the title track but hell i would enjoy almost anything from them probably? I am just confident that they are able to make any concept work quite honestly, for the title track it is imo more important to publish something the general public likes, the other songs on the EP can be more experimental if teddy wants to go for it :D",1,420,77
Jisoo with long hair is a fkin‚Äô goddess tbh. We‚Äôll see.,1,55,11

That's kind of my point though. YG as a company is trash. ,1,58,12
Red Velvet had 3 comebacks in 2018 with 2 english songs.....each one of those comeback albums were quality AF. I dunno why people think quality takes that much time. It doesn't. ,1,178,31
But there's a balance in Kpop. A good Kpop company will maximize revenue by utilizing their employees and their employees talent. YG does not do that. At all. I'm still infuriated that Lee Hi keeps getting buried by YG. Anyone could tell you out of the big 3 that YG is the absolute worst and many of us wish the other 2 would just steal all the YG artists away so they can get some REAL support. You bet your ass JYP or SM would take advantage of those situations. Imagine BlackPink under JYP or SM. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR: YG is terrible business and doesn't innovate. BP deserve better,1,584,108

"&gt;itzy's debut song is horrible but they have the power of JYP fanboys behind them so it was never going to flop. I don't visit  anymore but I think it's only natural the front page is spammed with itzy posts as they've just debuted. It's hilarious you say that, this is **EXACTLY the same type of shit** haters at  say about BP. ""All of BP songs are horrible but they have the power of YG fangirls so it charts and never flops"" This ladies and gentlemen is a good example. If you can feel so pressed and salty like that about Itzy - a group that just debuted not long ago, and only has ONE song for feelings to be harbored Think about how much more pressed and saltier non blinks feel against BP? - they are wildly successful with an unconventionally smaller discography and although I LOVE his beats Teddy's style isn't for everyone. Some people genuinely think that their songs are too similar and not their cup of tea so they get salty when BP gets success after success If you say your opinions on Itzy were genuine and not fueled by fandom hate, then not that hard to see why BP gets hate like that too lol (although I disagree, most of the people saying stuff like that already stan a group/company they like, including you)",1,1233,229
Its a bit different though. Drake Lebron etc have had opportunities to actually WORK to be at the top. BP has had so few opportunities its disgusting that YG is still somehow keeping them down. As a BLINK I actually WANT them to work.....YG just doesn't seem to like to let them. Give me new music! ,1,299,56
Nah not really. In reality its kind of a fanboy/girl thing on both sides. The OP is obviously frustrated that no one is massively upvoting BP content in there. Many there don't feel BP needs more publicity so they downvote it. Nothing new in the reddit world. ,1,260,47
"There's harmonizing and then there's being part of a chorus. The example of Jisoo is whistle doesn't really apply to this song. In Whistle she's playing a supporting role. Her voice volume is lowered and distorted as well. So it's less about being able to ID her tone, but noticing that it's even there. In this case, they're at full voice. Again, I'm not here calling bullshit, but it's more that even if it is them, what's it matter even if it doesn't sound like them? ",1,471,86

The GMA performances were a bit shaky and the backing tracks were way too loud, but they did amazing during the interviews. They will be fine.

"Don't be ridiculous lol, the ""quality&gt;quantity"" point doesn't mean it should take them over a year to make a comeback.

"Tbh, I do not follow  But these are several reason why ppl hate BLACKPINK I have encounter: 1- the way YG media play. YG and his staff compared BLACKPINK with other Kpop idols several times, driving their fandom nuts. I particularly remembered BLACKPINK's stylish mentioned other girlgroups and implied that their fashion style was no where near BLACKPINK's. 2- The way YG treated his other artists like CL, One, Lee Hi, Seungri (BIGBANG), and more. BLACKPINK has been undeniably viral, and has brought money a lot of money. That's why YG paid more attention than other. The other artists in YG are extremely talented, but their talent is, unfortunately, hidden in the dungeon. As for Seungri, a BIGBANG member, has not been treated like he deserve. YG forgot his solo concert, sent him no dancers (I'm not sure about the band and stylish) and even told Seungri that he didn't need any backup dancers, and said that all dancers had been sent to BLACKPINK's concert. (Which was absolutely annoying, bcz there were only 4 dancers in our girls' concert. What kind of entertainment company have only 4 dancers?) 3- Some so-called Blinks are so immature and triggered easily for no reasons. 2 example are CL's post and DJ Snake's following Lisa on Instagram. As for CL's post, some Blink misunderstood CL and thought that she implied Jennie. They replied with no respect to CL. As for DJ Snake, some ppl kept commented and DM him, saying why he followed Lisa but not other members, which really annoyed him. 4- Jennie's scandal about no-energy dance and later dating Kai. Actually, most ppl just hate BLACKPINK and specifically Jennie before, and later used these scandal as an excuse to hate. Some EXO-L hate Jennie for dating Kai. As you can see, most of these reasons are bcz of how YG works. Our girls have nothing to do with them. They have been trying so hard (Jennie also improved her stamina to dance more energetically). What they need is BLINK's support and YG's professionalism. ",1,1985,341
"I am sure most of the users of this blackpink sub are devoted blinks who have quite a high degree of rationality, i.e. genuinely hoping the girls are doing their best in all aspects without sowing discords ,bashing other groups or spreading fake rumours. However, as bp's fanbase is really big I can say, there are way more fans who do exactly the opposite every single day since they become a bp stan, and I genuinely feel hopeless about this, because this is what the very present generation looks like.... sigh",1,513,91
"That's not the point Im making dude. In my opinion D4, Love scenario, Killing me or idol all would have been fine as SOTY. Some blinks took it so bad, they started bombarding all Twice videos with hatecomments and it just shines a bad light on the whole fandom. And any award worldwide isnt fair, its mostly not about popularity or how much of a banger your song is, but about how many cds you sold and if you attend the show. And while Blackpink is becoming the biggest kpop group in the western world, Twice was still selling more CDs in the asian market (Korea/Japan). Dont't get me wrong I feel betrayed aswell, because BP won so little, but it's not the blame of the other artists.",1,686,128
Oh shit I can hear Jennie clearly and kind of Rosie? And possibly Jisoo? Okay you know what I have no idea I have officially failed as a blink ,1,143,29
"&gt; Take song of the year awards for example, some toxic blinks are all over themselves, because another group won, while not understanding, that the other group sold more cds in that region. I'm assuming you mean MAMA where they hate YG artists and BP didn't even attend? Blinks have every reason to shit on that award show and the winner should've been Love Scenario or DDDD. The reaction and discussion around it is perfectly valid.",1,436,76
"Why are you so offended? I was talking explicitly about girlgroup fandoms and there is a part of blinks and lisa stans shitting on every Twice video, leave alone music videos. Take song of the year awards for example, some toxic blinks are all over themselves, because another group won, while not understanding, that the other group sold more cds in that region. I love Blackpink, but how some fans can't be peaceful is a real bummer to me. And yeah I know that boygroup stans are toxic aswell, but the one you mean is the biggest and most active fandom in the world, so I get why there are so many toxic people. Im not defensing them, because Im not part of their stuff at all.",1,679,127
"I dunno about this. I'm not going to go as far as to call bullshit here but you'd have to distort Rosie's and Jisoo's voices to high hell for me to not be able to pick them out. I can maybe hear Jennie's voice in there, but that's about it. ",1,241,50
"I totally agree with you, just from what Ive experienced I have the feeling that blackpink has a higher percentage. Some are so obsessed theyre not only trashing on other groups, but even on their non-fav Blackpink members. ",1,224,38
"Most of the hate comes from JYPE fanboys. They are so insecure and jealous that BP has made their favourite group irrelevant. Any person who is commenting negative bullshit against BP, you go to their post history or just look at their flair, 80% of the time they are JYP drones, other times it's BTS fans. I urge all of you to visit rkpop when BP news is announced and downvote or report any unnecessary bullshit negative comments.",1,432,78
"Oh plz, I don't think most Blinks give a rats ass about Twice. It's usually BP video's being descended upon by other fandoms looking to spread hate especially that other big boy group fandom that I shall not name. Just look at the videos when BP were in America as an example. So when Blinks are defending their girls from these attacks they're now considered toxic and other side just feints being a victim. Classic.",1,417,75
Black Pink is the revolution and with more success comes haters. Let them waste their energy it‚Äôs amusing. ,1,107,18
"I learn to not look at yt comments on kpop mv's. I dont go on twice mv's cuz i dont listen to them so naturally, I wouldnt see these blinks' comments. Likewise, I mainly watch blackpink mv's so I naturally see toxic comments from other fandoms like onces or army's. But this doesnt mean anything since those kinds of fans are the obsessive, aggressive and loud ones that ruin it for the rest of us. In terms of which fandom is the most toxic, it comes down to fandom size. The larger the fandom, the more bad apples there are numerically speaking, but proportion wise, it's probably the same.",1,592,109
I don't think there is choreo for that part I think they're just meant to go off and have fun,1,93,20
They perform songs on the big stage too. Also they wander around and interact with the fans so I don't think you necessarily need to be in the front. If you just get a GA standing ticket there's with no priority queue then you could very well be standing all the way in the back if you don't come early and considering how big these arenas are it's very far away.,1,363,71
"I'd argue it's more like they're just ignored at this point, but yes it's certainly not super pretty",1,100,18

"The downvotes you‚Äôre getting by other fans is only proving your point. I agree stans think their Group can do no wrong and that‚Äôs the issue. I also think a contributing factor is that BLACKPINK just don‚Äôt have many songs but still get a lot of attention. It‚Äôs not their decision to make obviously, ikon has had three albums in the last 8 months-ish and Blackpink has had 1. I love Blackpink, but the criticism is often justified. Also let‚Äôs not forget that when dispatch announced their thing at the beginning of the year  was quick to shame dispatch for what they did. ",1,570,103
"Don't ask me, I'm still pissed that Orange Caramel isn't a thing anymore. ",1,74,13
"Have you really read comments? A lot people said theyre failing to imitate Blackpink and the debut song was a mess/unbearable.

Just because its like a ""teen crush"" concept it doesnt make them a blackpink imitation.",1,346,61
"Tbh  is hating on any group that is popular and if I'm being honest Blink is being the most toxic gg-fandom, atleast in the youtube comments throwing a bad light on Blackpink aswell. Everytime I visit youtube comments I recognize Blinks trashing on other groups, especially on Twice, so I get why the fandom isnt especially popular. And yes I love BP and theyre not responsible for their fandom, but I get why other people get pissed off by their fandom and might start hating because of that. Also some people might be just mad, that BP is getting more attention than their favs now.",1,584,105
To be honest I haven‚Äôt really noticed it. The only time I noticed anything similar was during SOLO when me and some other  subscribers were suggesting that they might need a break as Jennie seemed unwell or tired.

I want VIP mostly for the soundcheck, but I don‚Äôt really want to be in the golden circle whipping my head back and forth to watch them move around the stages. And from all the videos I‚Äôve seen of their shows, that mini stage seems to be where most of the fun is at (most of their talking goes on there, encore messing around etc.) So standing close as possible in front of that mini stage/GA ticket seems like the better option to get a better view. But I don‚Äôt know, the soundcheck is really tempting for me so I still haven‚Äôt decided what to get myself...",1,638,123
i think its bc most kpop idols are shooting cute and bp dares to be sexy so the other stans feel threatened by proxy through the idols one stans. also kpop fans are the most toxic fans out of any sort of hobby or interest not only one that i've taken up myself but even out of the ones i'm not into but just that i've ever witnessed. kpop fans are horrible. if you dont suck their fav idols figuretive dick they go apeshit.,1,423,84

"Yeah a lot of the feedback I‚Äôve read from those that attended BP‚Äôs concerts say the girls were really charismatic and super charming. Could they have more songs? Absolutely, but at the end of the day, people go to their concerts because they want to see the girls. ",1,265,48
I honestly don‚Äôt know why one has to end the other. Good groups can coexist. Their musical styles aren‚Äôt even the same! But anytime haters see a non-cutesy concept? Omg they coming for BP! That actually goes to show how popular BP has become though. People now look to BP as the standard and will use the girls as the measuring stick for anything not in the cutesy area. ,1,371,69
"Since the OP says all topics are okay, I'm going to ask: what other groups would you love to see in person besides BLACKPINK? I have to admit that I would love to see Apink perform live. All of them are so adorable, and it is a completely different vibe than BP. If you can watch the Mr. Chu M/V without cracking a smile, my hat's off to you. Third on my list would be a concert by the lineup that did Wow Thing: SinB, SeulGi, Chung Ha and Soyeon. I know they only have one song, but I'm pretty sure I could handle that on loop live for an hour without getting bored. Fourth on my list would be GFRIEND. Their music is bubblegum kpop but they mix in some musical twists and references that makes it interesting, plus their dancing is top notch. Finally, I would love to have been able to see 2NE1 in their heyday. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for Sandara and Bom. You never forget your first. &amp;#x200B;",1,917,178

This comment section is full of ""they're jealous"" (go off I guess, that's not a strong argument) or ""r/kpop is toxic"" (but only to BP apparently, cause I never seen toxicity towards other groups unless someone screwed up), but the reason is just... the negative people are louder. There are many people who like BP there, but the people who dislike BP or were let down by them speak up more and upvote more. Besides... That sub has many multis. I tend to see that many multis used to be BP fans when they debuted, but with the lack of content, they have grown resented, which doesn't justify but explains the behaviour. Of course there is a small fraction of jealous and haters, but y'all can't just assume that everyone who doesn't like what we like are just jaded.",1,806,147
100% true. i remember when jennie posted a vlive saying she didn‚Äôt know if they were gonna comeback and people were all sad for her and bp. Square Up comes out dominates and they all turn their backs and hate everything bp related lmao ,1,236,44

"At least from what I see it has to do with level of effort put in. Barely any songs in almost 3 years, the lazy Jennie controversy and yet she gets the solo, YG just throwing money around but not actually using their talents, and 9 songs. Combine that with things like RV's world tour almost being overshadowed in the news by BP simply showing up in the US, solo artists like Tiffany and Sunmi getting glanced over as well, it rubs some folks the wrong way. Makes a little bit of sense if you think about it from their standpoint. Overall pretty stupid though. Kpop fans tend to be a bit stupid and don't realize that the artists themselves DGAF. While everyone argues, meanwhile Jennie has brunch with Irene. ",1,710,130

They were like that with BP too during their debut days, except for a few Blackjacks that were bitter that 2ne1 got sacked and wrongly put their anger on the BP girls instead of the company.

"Hey everyone this is my first time commenting here and I came to ask for some tips. I have floor tickets (no vip) to their LA concert but never bought GA tickets before. Also as a short 5'2 female have mild buyer's remorse about whether I should've done this. Do you think I should try to stand as close to the main stage as possible, or near the far end of that catwalk? And for a short girl, is it actually better to be a little farther away than to be up close and have a tall person in front of me? Second question: how GA entry works. I was watching TV when BTS came to Staples center in LA and all these people were lined up in the morning for entry bracelets. For non-vips, would that also be the case for BP? The earlier you line up, the better chances for getting in earlier? I feel like if I entered at 7 (1 hr before show) I'd likely get the worst leftover floor spots. Any tips are appreciated for a first timer. ",1,925,183
"Its jealousy because Blackpink is backed by YG money, they felt its unfair as if money can bring you fame if you have no talent, true money can open a lot of doors but you play with the cards you are dealt with. Certain fandom was due to the fact BP is coming to an area where they felt they owned. ",1,299,61
Well yes BTS has ppl defending them that doesn't mean they don't get hate. BP don't get as much support on  b/c the fandom doesn't even use reddit or they've left already realizing a what a dumpster fire that place is. If you want to see how savage the BP fandom can be try saying something negative of them on Twitter or Instagram you'll get torn to pieces.,1,358,68
"One thing BP gets shade for is because they exploded in popularity in less time and with less songs than some of the groups they like. In their minds this makes them ""undeserving"". (obviously I disagree with this and think it makes no sense but it happens.) A lot of the YG hate I see isn't necessarily directed towards the girls in BP it seems more about people hating how he manages the group.(That's just what I've seen) I started typing a really long response to this but [I remembered this video by proZD](  and honestly it explains it better than I can and it's way more entertaining than my ramblings.",1,608,111
"The biggest problem I think exists, which is a problem I have with a lot of the big groups, is that stans so often think their group can do no wrong. Release a bad song? Impossible. I think a lot of the hate for BP comes from the fact that do they REALLY deserve an American debut? They are talented for sure, but they are debuting with one of their worst songs (IMO), haven't even bothered with an English version. Don't get me wrong, I like BP and they're one of my top GG, but every single one of their American appearances has made me cringe. ",1,547,106

"Welcome to the world of Kpop fandoms, enjoy your stay.",1,54,10
"The most common form of ""hate"" I saw towards BP is mostly dismissive in nature. Things like ""BP only has high YT views due to their fandom,"" ""Any BP song is called good because of their fandom,"" ""BP is only popular because they're from YG,"" and the most repetitive comment yet, ""ThEy OnLy HaVe 9 SoNgS!"" Dismissing a group's success due to their fanbase doesn't make any sense to me since you need a fanbase to get big, right? BP didn't start out with all these fans. BP being successful due to only YG is also a weak point since BP had to get into YG first before becoming BP. For the YT views, sure, some of it is due to fandom streaming but it's still something significant.",1,677,128
Best decision you‚Äôve ever made. I remember seeing the American Gods trailer (with BP‚Äôs D4 dance) posted in  and the people in the community kept on reporting it that [this](  had to be posted in the comments. Crazy. ,1,216,38
"It depends on whether or not they plan well or not. BTS has thousands of extra and didn‚Äôt run out their entire tour (and they sold batteries), but Red Velvet sold our repeatedly - at least in LA.

itzy's debut song is horrible but they have the power of JYP fanboys behind them so it was never going to flop. I don't visit  anymore but I think it's only natural the front page is spammed with itzy posts as they've just debuted.,1,231,44
"There is most certainly a bias against Blackpink on  but I also am proud to see people calling out and countering the hate comments.

That's why these anti's always make predictions like ""How they expect to do a world tour with only 9 songs?"" then it blows their mind when BP sells out their concerts and makes them hate BP even more. Yes, some fans are invested in thinking that there needs to be 'blood on the dance floor' for a group to be ""successful"", but BP's fame proves that's not a necessary ingredient. ",1,607,117

"Kpop fandoms is a toxic culture. BP is a prime target for hate right now b/c how popular they are getting and how they've started to bleed into mainstream music culture.

If they come out with a song I like, I'll enjoy it. I can appreciate the fact they tied Izone for debut to win (beating BP). And I feel for the Lee sisters receiving hate for their looks.

These people think that only 1 company and or 1 group is good and all else is bad. They are promoting the hell out of Itzy calling them the JYP version of BP. So in their mindset, they need to take down 1 group so that the other might prevail. Go back 6 months and look for post about Somi while she was still with JYPE and you will see people here love her. Have a peak into the Somi post today about her debut and you will now see hate directed at her singing and dancing talent, at Teddy, at Sunmi (another that left JYP), at Blackpink, at YG, and everything else these JYPE fanboys and fangirls perceive as a threat to JYPE dominance. They've become as insufferable as the childish members of the BTS Army. A small, vocal subsection makes the whole look bad.

"I haven't seen the hate myself, but I wouldn't be surprised. Success brings out haters in everything, BLACKPINK included. With BLACKPINK gaining traction in the U.S., their popularity is rising, bringing forth many eyes on the group, both good and bad. It just so happens that the ""bad"" ones are the loudest and will voice their opinion more than the majority of ""good"". If you ever ask a hater their reasoning for their distaste, often times their excuse is obviously one with very little backing to it (Jennie is lazy, Jisoo can't dance, etc.). Usually the actual reason is jealousy/envy and fan warfare that isn't even worth acknowledging. To answer your question from another comment, yes, BTS had just as much hate thrown at them when they hit it big in the U.S. The best thing to do is just support those you like and ignore those those that are toxic to the community.

I honestly think the effect that turned people off ended up having the opposite effect. So many of my friends who don't follow kpop tuned into and enjoyed Jennie's solo. They didn't even see the MV, just this choreography video and said this was fire. It really brought a different element and color to BLACKPINK as sort of an extension of the group's color. This was definitely the intention for their solos and I've been an advocate for it.

Elegant k-pop award show style outfit for Jisoo, Jennie was Chanel of course, Lisa with her signature pants and Rose with her street style vibe dresses is all fine - but they were all in very different colour combos and their makeup/hair styling was also extremely different.

I purchased the Blink VIP Package for the Chicago tour at 8pm does anyone know exactly when you will be able to enter the venue and see the sound checks? This is to decide whether I should skip school or not to make use of my tickets‚Äô ability.,1,243,48
"They work for YG Ent. as backup dancers. The group names are ""Crazy"" for the girls and ""Hi-Tech"" for the boys. ",1,111,21
That was the one thing that I thought made them look different than other groups was the fact that they were seen as distinct individuals coming together to make a group not a bunch of clones of each other. I like how the girls have their own style in the group idk why it should be changed. ,1,292,57
"Although this is a little tangent from your comment, I've been hearing a lot of complaints of their stylists lately how they're doing a poor job. Personally, I don't get it. The girls look great and I've never seen a questionable outfit on any of them before. With regards to a consistent group image, that makes sense. They had one during their DDDD promotions with a black and pink theme that was nice.",1,404,73
"Definitely. Although none of the girls are alarmingly skinny (like skin and bones level), I've seen some fancam photos where some of the girls looked especially thin where it's noticeable. Again, they can be naturally thin. I get that. I was a 5' 11"" and 120lb guy in HS but I've gained weight since then.",1,305,55

"I don't know if it's super common but I've seen some criticism, or rather concern, that the girls are looking quite skinny, Ros√© especially. I actually don't disagree at all to be honest. I know they're all naturally thin and performing all the time certainly keeps you in shape, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't slightly concerned about how/the company is taking care of themselves/them.",1,391,68

"Recently I've felt that the stylists are trying really hard to make each of them look different from another, especially in their US promotions. I'm personally not a fan of it. As they are a group, I think there needs to be something that ties them together visually as well (apart from their killer beauty of course :) ) I am really looking forward to how their styling will be this upcoming comeback. I guess I might be hoping for too much here...",1,449,83

"This is exactly why I‚Äôm glad I bought a ticket for my older brother! He‚Äôs a pretty muscular guy. He also loves Blackpink, so when we heard they were coming to Newark, he wanted to buy tickets. He was at work though, so he put me in charge of snagging some. I managed to get floor seats with soundcheck after an hour of waiting! Later that night, he gave me my late birthday present (it‚Äôs almost been a year) and it was Blackpink‚Äôs lightstick! ",1,443,84
I‚Äôm so nervous this is my first concert in America and I managed to get the Blink VIP Package. Anyone know what the perks are?,1,126,25
"What the hell is going on? You know whats legit. When something is real, you feel it. Trust me.. seeing BP live...your gonna feel it throughout your body...its loud yet sounds good! Feelin the beat awesome..so go ahead and lose your voice..i did for a few days lol! Enjoy The Revolution.",1,287,51

"I kinda was in a similar boat with BTS last year. When I was on holiday in Singapore I saw a group of people performing DNA on a public stage, and when I got home and listened to more of their stuff, I was hooked. Hooked on BTS and kpop again after a break since the old SNSD where a big thing (2007-2008). At the end of last year, BTS announced that they would perform in my country (NL), and I was stoked. Can you imagine a 30 yo white guy going alone to a KPOP boy band? Me neither. I was in serious conflict the days leading up to the start of the ticket sale. ""Do I seriously want to surround myself with screaming teenage girls?"". But, I wanted to see their great choreography and hear their music live. I was at work, standing by, ready to buy, but unfortunately it was sold out within minutes. But I'm not the kinda guy that only likes group, so I also started listening to other groups. Blackpink kinda has that BTS vibe as well, and fortunately they are girls, beautiful and funny. They will also perform in my country this year, and I'm stoked that I have bought pink vip tickets, so I will get to see them up close, omg.",1,1132,220
"A family friend went to a Beatles concert in the states when they toured here, however, she didn't actually *hear* the Beatles because everyone screamed the entire concert. I'm sure you &amp; the other Blinks will be let Blackpink be heard lol",1,243,42

"Theres nothing wrong with your age and interests!!! You like what you like. I never gave two shits about any celebrity until I discovered K-POP and BLACKPINK. I cried my eyes out and screamed to the top of my lungs when I seen BTS. I know I will do the same thing at this BP concert. The girls are such an inspiration to me and although Im the same age as them, I still look up to them.",1,386,78
"Speaking of tears, I remember commuting to school one day on a bus and BP's AIIYL came on and I legit teared up at the chorus. I didn't know why it happened. As a 20 year old guy at the time, it was so random but I was really happy at that moment.",1,247,53
"Nah it's cool, if it's true, I guess I'm going to a second show :D",1,66,15
"To be honest, I wasn't extremely excited to see the concert but I still love BP. The concert was so amazing and I was on the standing area and got to see them so close. Now, I'm suffering from severe PCD, and can't sleep at night lmao. ",1,236,47
Agreed. Anyone who was originally invested im 2ne1 or SNSD is probably gonna be in their late 20s early 30s now,1,111,21

"Oooh Terrace House! I remember scrolling through Netflix and seeing this super pretty Eurasian girl on the cover for this Terrace House show and decided to give it a shot to see more of her. This was Aloha State and I ended up having a huge crush on Lauren Tsai (the eurasian girl) haha. Reality tv shows are super not my thing, especially one in a completely different language, but I actually really enjoyed it. ",1,414,75
Start time according to ticket was also 6pm. Concert maybe started 5-10mins later. ,1,83,13
"Yeah idol life is very hard and sometimes lonely, they pretty much have no personal life and have to monitor themselves in everything they do as to not harm the group. Despite all that they always have a smile on their face and are some of the most warm hearted celebrities I've seen. I've followed them extensively and they have no mean bone in their body and seem very genuine in their actions. I'm sure behind the scenes they do face problems in life just like the rest of us since they're human. If they do, they seem to approach it maturely and try to make sure not to let their fans worry about them. ",1,607,115
"&gt;it involves a bunch of things that sincerely is hard to understand if you`re not an sound engineer. Which you don't seem to be, or aren't a very good one given your wild estimates on how long it takes to do something. Where are you coming up with your estimates? These are not accurate at all. It's completely normal for Producers to have.. for example week long song writing sessions these days where they'll complete 5+ tracks entirely. Someone like teddy has definitely pumped out enough material to believe he can do that as well. Besides that, since BP aren't involved in any production, they literally only need to be there for vocal recording, which absolutely can be, and general is done in less than a day. On album projects, some producers will even take a day per girl and record an entire album worth of vocals per member. (Don't know if YG works that way, but you still get the point how fast it can be done) I can see someone spending a week on a song if they're THAT much of a perfectionist, but you're off your rocker if you think it takes a month per song.",1,1077,199
I will probably get a tear in my eye when the appear on stage in LA. I'm pre-blaming it on manopause! :),1,104,22
"My journey to BLACKPINK was very odd. My son got me started watching Terrace House which turned me onto J-Dramas. After running out of J-Dramas on Netflix I tried a K-Drama and was hooked. I think I was looking at some K-Drama site when I saw something about CL and ended up watching her ""Hello B\*tches"" video and it blew my mind. From CL I discovered 2NE1 and while watching their M/Vs on Youtube, I saw BLACKPINK Ddu-du Ddu-du pop up and that was it: I was fully and truly hooked. I know that in this era of fake news, you can't really trust everything you see, but it seems like BLACKPINK are the nicest and sweetest girls you could ever meet. They really seem like they love each other and their fans, and it makes you only want the best for all of them. I'm sure I'm not the only person here that worries about whether they are living good lives and enjoying themselves. I would hate to find out that YG was abusing them or stealing their money or something else. I know they life of an idol his not ""normal"", but I truly hope for all four of them that it is worth it. (Mushy mode off.)",1,1092,210
"Yea, I don't really look for content from celebrities unless it's the subject matter is something I'm interested in, if that's understandable. But definitely hypnotized by BP songs lol I really can't make sense of it but I'm enjoying it!",1,237,40
"I actually heard them first, I was curious about the rapping because I thought it sounded good as I grew up mainly with rapping. Then I looked them up, thought they were pretty but was more curious if they had more songs. So for me it was the music first. And I had no previous K-pop interest at all.",1,300,59

"Nearly 50% of seats on TM now are resales at 5x\~10x original price, so you can see how many tickets was snatched to make money, instead of true fans going...This is just disgusting... ",1,185,33
"I first heard them soon after their debut. I have a bunch of cousins that listen to Kpop and I heard BP through them. I would say I got entrapped around September 2016. Also, it is interesting to note that despite their lack of musical activities, they continue to have more subscribers and views. It's almost anomalous.",1,320,57
they started at 6 but what was the start time according to the ticket? 4 or 5? Just curious for the canada show,1,111,23
"When did you get into BP? I first got into them during the AIIYL era. Then had to endure a 1 year drought with no new BP music ughh..I'm glad Square Up was a massive success b/c I was super worried the long break could've sunk them as a group. There's just something with these girls that with all the obstacles they face, they just keep getting bigger and bigger.",1,364,70
She says so much without saying a single word. ,1,47,9
"This observation has always fascinated me cuz this is me as well. Before BP, I listened to mostly rock and metal. And for your last point, I remember hearing Whistle first. I didnt know how many members there were or how they looked but when I searched up their song, I was pleasantly surprised by their visuals. And when i found out they were all total sweethearts, I knew I was fan for life.",1,393,74
It's already been [confirmed](  there's a comeback mid to late March.,1,69,11
YG already confirmed they're having a comeback with an EP mid to late March. Why you do think they're including the EP for the NA tour?,1,135,26
Only BP can make dabbing a trend again.,1,39,8
LoL yeah it's kind of weird. I see ppl on here into heavy metal and rock and their taste in music changed when they got into BLACKPINK. I guess I kind of understand the girls are pretty looking which is the first hook but then you get to know them and love their music which turns you into a life long fan.,1,306,62
U right anything with jisoo is ,1,31,6
"its okay, i didnt get a ticket either. üíî bills to pay right when they announced the tour, haha. but i really hope they come back too, i need to be in the same building as them at least once in my life!",1,201,43

"i don\`t know what the girls said,i know what the original poster is implying,and i\`m explaining to him that songs are not recorded that quickly. aside that,let\`s go point by point of what you said 1. what the girls say should not be taken 100% at face value,because they don\`t have control over anything that goes in the company,if YG decides that will not be released it will not be released,let me give you an example, red velvet ""Î¥ê (look)"",was actually a song meant for F(x) in 2015 (it was already recorded),but for whatever reason SM scrapped it and released it 3 years later,in a different group,what i want to illustrate here is,songs are not certain till you see a teaser of it,regardless of the company.(i can provide other examples if you want,but i want to maintain this short) 2. the problem is not where you went,but how many times you did so,constant time shifts takes a toll on your body,because your mind doesn\`t know what the fuck is happening,your mind uses day and night cycles so it can process,sort out,and store information that it needs,if you keep fucking with your day and night cycle over and over again,your brain just enters in panic mode and becomes completely lethargic,and becomes easier the catch some kind of disease,injure yourself,or just flat out faint. 3. songs are actually really hard to record,i\`ve never heard of anyone who have recorded a whole song in hours,it normally takes 1 to 2 weeks to complete it, takes a lot of time to find the right emotion,clear mumblings,proper enunciation,fixing lyrics that are not fitting in the beat or in the melody (of the singing line),creating the singing line in the first place,sorting out who sings what part,eliminating voice strains,cracks,decorating the lyrics,and more. post-production comes after those 1 or 2 weeks,and it involves a bunch of things that sincerely is hard to understand if you\`re not an sound engineer. 4. MVs in kpop apparently are made over night,so in that you\`re right . 5. choreography has to be changed too,for a myriad of reasons,ranging from being too hardcore to do and sing at the same time,or the performers not being able to execute it properly,not fitting with the beat,or with the lyrics,or the company just being asshats and wanting it to change for whatever reason,that all takes time,after you\`ve done that (probably 2 weeks if everything is magically going smooth ) you still have to learn the choreography and your memory needs time to absorb shit like that( at least two more weeks doing it everyday)",1,2534,429

"Not sure if there would be any room left. I think the only visible denim is trim and seams. It's got lots of big patches for Iron Maiden, Lamb of God, Exodus, Slayer, etc. I like BlackPink a lot, I'd want to give them a bigger patch and better spot than like the bottom seam. Maybe I'll just get a new vest and cover it in kpop patches. That's a neat idea. ",1,357,72
Put a Blackpink patch on your battle jacket. Now that's an idea,1,63,12
I'm in the same boat as you both...except I didn't get a ticket. :( Its ok though cuz I really doubt that this will be the last time they come here!,1,148,31

"I know what you mean about watching content. I've rewatched reaction videos multiple times. I never even knew reaction videos were a thing before Blackpink!

I can't think of any other reason for me to be as hooked on their music as I am.",1,375,66
"Man, I get you. I've never cared about celebrities or anything. Have music I like but never once really cared of I saw anyone live or anything.

I don't always trust what yg says but have to reason to doubt those 2. While I image they are tired from all the traveling I would be suprised if they are suffering from jet lag from flying within Asia, it would definitely have effected them going to america and back as it is caused by the change in timezone not the traveling itself. It also wouldn't take the them 2 weeks to record a song as they would be only recording vocals, they aren't involved in any other process as far as I'm aware, it would take them a couple of hours at most, the rest would be left the producers. That would leave them to learn the choreography while the songs are being mixed and mastered. The 5 weeks would give them time to promote and have a short break in an ideal world.",1,923,179

"The Paris concert iirc has a three hour schedule? So maybe that's the thing in Eu concerts. That may be because of new songs? In my experience, the concert I went to lasted close to 2hours, around 1hr and 45mins.",1,212,40
"Singapore‚Äôs concert was from 7.30pm to 9.30pm, after an encore and a very spontaneous Happy Birthday to Ros√©. People who went for the soundcheck party were randomly drawn from the Cat 1 ticket holders one day before. So we didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äòsoundcheck package per se. I‚Äôll just let you know my timeline (I got drawn for the soundcheck.) However, depending on the concert promoter, this will differ. Soundcheck registration will start at 2pm, but I reached the venue at 12 because there was an unofficial queue. After registration, you‚Äôll receive a soundcheck wristband and head to the security check at about 2.30 and then the holding area. You‚Äôll probably wait till about 4pm, then the soundcheck will begin. (I‚Äôll not spoil what happens unless you want me to) So after the soundcheck I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôll have to rejoin the general queue or soundcheck holders get to stay inside. (probably depends on promoter, for Singapore we had to head out and rejoin the general queue) Then you‚Äôll finally be inside, and well, enjoy the show! ",1,1032,177

Just came out from the KL concert. Started a little past 6pm and ended at 8pm. So approximately 1 hr 45 min to 2 hours. Europe and NA concert could/should be longer with new songs hopefully in March. Concert was fire today üî•üî•,1,225,43
"The 10AM registration‚Äôs for the merch that comes with the package. There‚Äôs not much to do after that. Just waited for 2PM for the queue, but we went inside around 3:30PM? There was a lot of waiting around lol but I didn‚Äôt stand the whole time! Try to sit/rest as much as you can lmao ",1,284,55
hahahahaha so how much time before the soundcheck should i be at the venue? what did you do while waiting? are other random blinks talk to each other in the queues? sorry for asking so many questions but thats the first time i attend a concert... thank you so much for answering me!!! i really appreciate it,1,307,57
10am seems so early if the soundcheck was at 4:30! What did you do during that time? Did you have to stand the whole time? I ask because I have soundcheck tickets but standing from 10am until the end of the concert would be the end of me...,1,240,48

"Yeah, it‚Äôs the same day! I got the soundcheck package and I had to be there at 10AM (the concert starts at 7PM). We were ushered inside the concert venue for the soundcheck, which started around 4:30PM and ended around 4:50PM. After that, we went out again and waited for a bit before going back in for the main concert. ",1,321,60

‚Äúlisa is a self proclaimed tomboy‚Äù pls show me where? That doesn‚Äôt mean she has to wear cargo pants all the time. Ros√© suits many different looks and it‚Äôs being underutilize by putting her in the same tops every time. Jisoo would also look good with more experimental styles. The point is they‚Äôre doing the bare minimum ,1,320,57
"Never said it was an ""excuse"" but if you're going to compare outfits then at least do it in a even playing field and don't handpick the nice outfits vs the ""bad"" ones(this is more directed at the person who made that tweet). Personally i liked their outfits at MMA, yes the wardrobe malfunction for Ros√© was bad and the outfit(s) could've been better but they weren't as bad as people say imo.",1,393,73
"Jennie is sponsored by chanel, Lisa is a self-proclaimed tomboy, Rose suits those types of tops, and Jisoo shines in those classically pretty dresses. it looks more like they've found their comfort zone than the styling being bad. sure, this does get repetitive, but i think they're at the point in their careers where they would speak up if something doesn't look right to them. they're big girls and they know what they're doing.",1,431,74
that does not excuse the fact that her concert/performance outfits are redundant right now and feels like the bare minimum along with all the wardrobe malfunctions. You‚Äôre conveniently not including the Melon Music Awards 2018 atrocious outfits. ,1,246,37
"Look i'm not a huge fan of the new stylist BUT and this is a big BUT the tweet with pictures in question that you linked seems to be a bit misleading and i'll tell you why: On the upper row you have picture 3, 4, 5 and 6 from end of the year award shows(Seoul Music Awards, SBS Gayo Daejun, Asia Artist Awards and Melon Music Awards to be correct) on these award shows it's comon for the stylist to dress them up even better. Now if you notice, none of the pictures on the bottom row are from what i can tell any end of the year award shows but only from either concerts or promotional events like shopee. If you look at Blackpinks 2019 end of the year award outfits they look a lot better and hold up to the outfits shown on the top. Like the [Golden Disc Awards 2019 outfits](  or the [SBS Gayo Deajun 2019 outifts](  for example.",1,832,164

"Late response. But yes ticketmasters site is godawful. Red Velvet tickets I had it open on my phone and my browser and neither would allow me to actually buy the tickets. This time with BP I had 3 different browsers open and my phone. I got into the pre-que with all 4. When the timer expired 2 of my browsers failed and I lost the pre-que. My last remaining browser had me around 400th in q and my phone was around 1800. It took me selecting the package I wanted and trying to buy it like 8 times before finally going through. Which sadly is an improvement over the last time. For RV I got kicked out of the q and couldn't buy tickets and it kept saying all the FLR seats were sold out. I called their automated line and managed to get CFLR tickets. TL;DR Ticketmasters website and app are completely garbage and unreliable. As ridiculous as it sounds, be ready to try and call them and do it over the phone because you might have a better shot. ",1,947,181
I thought it was only Jennie who would pick out stuff. I remember when they were getting a lot of backlash in 2017 as to why Jennie had the best/ most expensive outfits and stylist said Jennie was the only member who would help choose her outfits.,1,247,47
"I actually like the way they were styled when square up dropped, the outfits were a little more adventurous than before. Although their outfits previously were more cohesive. My personal problems with the styling: Ros√© wears a lot mini skirts and bralettes, there was one performance of D4 were she wore a trousers and she looked great. Her outfits need more variety. Even though Lisa pulls of the outfits, sometimes it's too much. There was a recent interview with the new stylist said that Lisa usually gets the outfits that the other girls can't pull off. Jennie and Jisoo outfits are the most consistent. Although I wish the stylists would make sure the soles of heels that they wear were sanded down, sometimes you can see their about to slip. On whether the girls actually like their outfits, there never actually going to admit it if they don't, they'd be labelled as ungrateful and rude especially in Korea. And even if they did it would be in a humorous manner on a variety show or something. ",1,1002,176

"To be totally honest, you have to blame AXS and Ticketmaster for scalping their own tickets....I looked into AXS Premium just to see how much the P1 $198.50 were going for, apparently AXS scalped themselves and said these ""premium seats"" have amazing view, therefore they're selling it for like $550+ on the day of! Said it was market price, and each time you inquire about the tickets, the price fluctuates depending on how many people are looking at premium seats, hence **""MARKET PRICE""** &amp;#x200B; Drives me mad because it's a lot of people's first time buying and they do not know any better. Then after buying these premium seats...they see their friends get it for regular price...it hurts. Hence the reason why some resale tickets are SUPER high. Can't blame some of them, they bought the wrong tickets and trying to get rid of them. &amp;#x200B;",1,857,146
"Yes. Late night shows in America show reruns during breaks from filming. So, for example, if Colbert isnt filming new shows for the first week in March, they'll still show the Late Show every night that week but they'll all be re-runs picked from the last month-ish of shows. So Colbert is going on break and the BP episode is on of the ones they are showing as a rerun during the break.",1,387,73

"I've been a kpop fan since 2008 and trust me I've seen a lot kpop fans being so devoted to their idol to the point that they're like obsessed (?) with them in a very alarming way. Like they will blame anyone in the company if their favorite isn't getting what the fan wants. They will literally exaggerate everything and make theories and conclusion about whats happening behind camera which is obviously nothing LOL. These outfits for me are fine, and as far as I know the girls coordinate with their stylists on what they want to wear. ",1,538,98
"I did not talk about dividing into two camps, just wanted peoples thoughts. Other people in the thread have articulated their thoughts more clearly and respectfully than you have. ",1,180,29
"Yes, let's be patient for now. In the event they add more dates, we can buy our tickets then and let those who gambled on reselling tickets be forced to bring down prices to more a acceptable rate. I saw a $1300 seat and $666 seat within a row of each other for P1 lol ridiculous right?",1,286,57
"I've seen this before ""It's just my opinion, can we never criticize??"" This is bullshit of course. You titled your post ""We really need to talk about the stylists"". This is a loaded statement. It implies a lot of (mostly negative) things. No, we don't 'need' to talk about their stylists. I never thought this was an issue until you posted about it. Which is my whole point. Posts like yours are created to divide fans into two camps : Love Their Look / Hate Their Look. That discussion hurts the girls in the end.",1,514,95
Definitely agree with you about the malfunctions It‚Äôs happened to Rose during one of their American tv performances also. ,1,122,19
"My only problem is sometimes the outfits look uncomfortable/not functional for dancing. For example, Lisa's chains breaking during the Grammy party or Rose's shirt ripping at an award show. Also Lisa's outfit at that same award show had these like dangling chain things that looked so uncomfortable and distracting while she was dancing. In those examples, I thought the outfits themselves were cute, just not functional for performing. I could give more examples but eh. Wardrobe malfunctions will happen regardless and the girls are well trained to deal with them, but I do think more attention could be paid to that aspect of the styling. Otherwise, I don't understand all the hate toward the stylists. Fashion is about taking risks. Not all outfits are going to be a hit. Fashion is also highly subjective, people have different tastes. Luckily with BP, most outfits are a hit (imo) and let's be honest, they could go out there wearing garbage bags and still look amazing. ",1,977,163
"lots of people follow artists even if they dislike a recent project. For example I disliked Lana Del Rey‚Äôs Honeymoon album, but stayed with her and her new album is amazing.

"No, because the songs are why they exist. But if they dropped a new EP that was generally well received by the fandom, and one person kept posting about how much that EP sucked, I'd ask that person why they were still following the group if they hate everything new they are doing.

"I've also seen this excuse many times. Yes, you can talk about these things of course, but I will fight it every single time because I think in the end, these complaints are destructive, and create divisions in the fandom, and in the end that hurts the girls.

Do they usually tell what episode they're going to tell when they're on vacation? I watch a couple Late night shows but the only one I follow on sns is Stephen. I was a bit surprised they told it was this episode. I figured it was because of the big ratings boost it got.,1,271,54

The EP coming with the tickets is G E N I US. Ticket album bundles count as album sales and is gonna put them directly on the charts when it releases. ,1,151,31
"See, No one really knows. Heck we don't even know if the girls are actually the one who are telling their stylists which they'd want to wear. So if the girls are actually the one who's choosing the style. What would we tell them? ‚ÄúAyt, change your style. We dont like it, its not what we paid for"". And im not saying you're complaining, stan twt is complaining tho. ",1,366,69

If you look at other groups they also wear the same variations of the same styling during their eras because that‚Äôs the look they‚Äôre going for ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôve noticed that Ros√© seems a lot more comfortable with her outfits now since they‚Äôre a mini skort kind of style where as before her short dresses were cute and different but they would constantly ride up and expose her safety shorts so she would constantly be pulling them down. As for her hair, maybe she‚Äôs not trying to put heat on it to not further damage it since she‚Äôs always changing the color. ",1,594,109
"of course me too, i love the members individually and the songs. but the packaging and ‚Äúlook‚Äù of a group can also be defining for them. SNSD for example always had cohesive but personalized outfits",1,197,35
"Fair enough. Personally, I like their songs, their performances, and the members individually so I'm all set. I think this BP stylist controversy is just obsessive fans looking into BP a little too much.",1,203,34
"Sorry but we‚Äôre allowed to opinions on everything from music to styling choices, it‚Äôs like saying any discussion will divide the fandom and end badly if you don‚Äôt blindly support everything about them",1,200,33
"A counter-argument to what exactly? I think that complaining about their look is disrespectful. And unnecessary.. I've seen the exact same complaints about other idols on their social media sites - it always ends badly - it just divides people,and in the end makes the fandom look entitled and petty.",1,300,50
"I realize that people in general just want the best for the girls, there is a nice motivation behind all of these complaints (at least partially). I am just not sure how reasonable it oftentimes is, especially when it comes to something which i would argue is really subjective like liking an outfit. If i look at the tweet i would agree that the top examples look better, but i already said why i think that presentation is a little flawed.",1,441,81
"that‚Äôs fine. some fans may be attending more to the looks than others. For me it‚Äôs about the whole impact of a performance, and sometimes Rose or Lisa‚Äôs styling can be distracting ",1,180,32
"IMO, their styling isn't even that bad compared to non-YG groups. The gap between how good (or normal) they are compared to YG groups is significantly larger than that comparing them to other non-YG ones, that I think it's fair enough to just gloss over. In other words, I'm just grateful they aren't as 'flamboyant' as other YG groups than I am to have any complaints comparing them to non-YG ones. In fact, I think they've got more 'styles' than say, Red Velvet.",1,464,83
"They all look fine to me. I literally had never thought, ""What is she wearing?!""",1,80,15
Fair point. Hopefully the next comeback this improves so we‚Äôll see ,1,67,11
"That tweet is cherry picking ""bad"" outfits and comparing them to the best before, that isn't a good way to present an argument. There are recent outfits which are excellent as well, just like there were outfits which weren't back then. All of this is highly subjective in the first place, you will like different things than me or 100 other people. I honestly think this stylist topic is one of the dumbest i have seen so far regarding blackpink, no offense (it was part of that cringy petition as well)",1,503,91

"We are fans of a group subscribed to the subreddit. We all have priorities, engaging in discussion about any aspect of the group is normal as fans. What you said isn‚Äôt insulting at all. I agree I cannot speak for everyone, but you really have failed to provide a solid counterargument so far to be honest ",1,305,56
"""Clearly not complimenting them"" Clearly? This is YOUR personal opinion. Don't say it like everyone agrees with you, or that everyone cares. I defer to professional stylists and the girl's own tastes. They always look cool enough for me. And if they did a show that I paid for and I found myself online complaining about their eyeliner or how how their tops were boring or their hair colour I would take a step back and reevaluate my priorities. ü§î",1,447,80
"We don‚Äôt know if the girls have complained about it to YG, but complaining about employees on social media wouldn‚Äôt make sense. This is just to discuss patterns of choices their styling team has made No one is complaining, it‚Äôs just observing and sharing constructive criticism ",1,278,46
"All i can say is that.. If the girls didn't complain, who am i to complain? ",1,76,16
"I never mentioned their weight or jennie‚Äôs dancing drama. This is a discussion about whether the styling is up to par with what they should deserve, and a comparison to the old stylist. It‚Äôs not the girls job to dictate the styling, otherwise why hire a styling team? No one said they are forcing the girls, but it‚Äôs clearly not good styling and has no variation",1,362,66
"I don't understand at all. They don't owe you a look that you approve of. If they like it, I like it. It's that simple.If I thought some evil stylist was forcing them into a look that the girls themselves hated, that would be different, but I find that very hard to believe Hey! We should talk about their weight now! And if they ""seem tired"" ",1,343,66
The part of that was good too. She find Jennie hot and has been touching her a lot haha,1,87,19
"We can‚Äôt really reach YG aside from instagram comments, and their stylists have limited comments on their own instagrams. That topic could be a good separate discussion thread ",1,176,28
"Fans want a good experience, I can understand that. Is there like a BBB for kpop where fans can make YG listen to their feedback though? And out of curiosity, what do you think is the reasoning behind people who like one member and vehemently hate another? I mean it's a group. Still can't wrap my head around that. ",1,316,59

"Telling a woman you don't like their hair, clothes and makeup is always a good idea! üòí",1,86,17
"Well, it is entertainment that we are consuming. And even if you dont have a connection or devotion to the girls, we do also deserve a good performance, stage show, styling etc. Look how many fans are debating whether or not to buy tickets just because we have so few songs. or because the girl‚Äôs solo performances are always the same... It‚Äôs about what the fans deserve too.",1,375,68
"I'm new to kpop, and only follow bp to be honest. I am really fascinated by kpop fans and their, I don't know, devotion? Talking about what these girls deserve and what not. No offense intended but the way people treat their kpop idols is fascinating. ",1,252,46
"That doesn‚Äôt match up to the comparison of their earlier era outfits to now. Have the girls also lost their creative touch? It extends all the way to the hair styling as well. Rosie‚Äôs hair is always straight now, when before she sported curls often ",1,249,45
Y‚Äôall forgot that the girls are helping curate their own outfits and they chose what to wear. It‚Äôs not necessarily the stylists fault. ,1,135,23

Ticketmaster reserve's a small portion of the tickets to do their Platinum sale program where they dynamically adjust the price. Right now for the LA concert there are only [8 pairs of Platinum tickets](  left. He makes it out like Ticketmaster bought most of the tickets in the arena. Ticketmaster does this for every concert with famous acts that are in demand. ,1,364,62
"I think the headline is still significant even with the bots and Ticketmaster doing their things. First of all, these are signs of high demand for the concert and happen with every popular tickets. But most importanty, let's not forget that this is by far the biggest US tourfor any Kpop girl group ever. These are big venues, and I remember people pointing out that BP was in trouble because group like EXO couldn't fill 2/3rd of the Atlanta venue. To ""officially"" sell out of almost 100k tickets in 6 dates, even with the Ticketmaster shenanigans, is significant and can't be simply handwaved away by bots. A group in little demand would flop all the same.",1,658,116
u so precious when u smileee,1,28,6
Ktown4u.com I've heard a few people say they got the welcome pack and albums from here with no complaints.,1,106,19
"They do ship to the US, but it is very expensive. It was $27 just for shipping for one shirt for me. The best place to buy official merch is hot topic. They are actually cheaper than YG select and way way less for shipping. They have fewer color options and I think only tshirts, but it's better than spending $60 on one shirt from YG select. Another option if you don't like the official merch is things like ebay or redbubble. I can't vouch for the ebay stuff but I have had very good experiences with redbubble when I've bought stuff from there in the past. If you still want to buy from YG select, use en.ygselect.com for USD and english. Just expect to pay a lot",1,667,128
Same! I ended up reselling my old ticket after getting a GA with soundcheck so I'm also interested to know other GA Blinks' plans!,1,130,24
"Yeah, we're not doing this bruh. Enjoy your show, if you're going. Cheers.",1,74,13
But it is sold out. So what if a person wants to sell the ticket for a profit it's their ticket to do what they want. BP already got paid.,1,138,30
"I'm just pointing out that the headline is false is all and just presenting my own personal relation the data, nothing beyond that, not here for an argument or anything lmao. Ticketmaster/events/resell/hobbies being shitty is not new to me. &amp;#x200B;",1,253,40
And why wouldn't they move? There are ppl who are upset they didn't get tickets and want more dates. sold out means tickets bought and BP got paid doesn't matter what the source is. The prices are jacked b/c of demand and ppl wanting to make profit. Eventually the price will get lower if they don't move or when it gets closer to the concert start date and get snatched. You make it sound like it's some new revelation and that this doesn't happen to other famous acts in the US. ,1,481,91

"Guide for not getting Scammed: 1. If possible meet in person for the transaction. Try to meet in a public place such as a coffee shop, library, police station. 2. Use PayPal ONLY, maybe cash. Do not use Venmo, ApplePay, ect. There is no way to get your money back if you use the other apps. 3. For PayPal: BE SURE to only send money using ""Goods and Services"". DO NOT send money using ""Friends and Family"". There is not buyer protection if you send using ""Friends and Family"". People might ask for you to send it to them using ""F&amp;F"" because it's ""faster"" or it is ""instant"". DO NOT. It's likely a scam. 4. If you can't meet in person, ask them for a screen record of them opening up the app and showing each of the tickets. There is NO reason they should not be able to do this. 5. Unfortunately, a lot of people who bought tickets bought with the intention of resale. Be wary of prices that are below face value. They need to have a solid reason of selling their tickets so quickly after buying them. 6. If you believe they are trying to scam you, let other BLINKS know. Screenshots only if you are sure. 7. I've heard this work, but if you do get scammed, you could try adding their relatives or parents and messaging them. Obviously you likely needed to have added them on Facebook First. If you have other tips, comment them below! They are planning a comeback around late March, so I wish you BLINKS the best of Luck :) We're going to see them at Coachella!",1,1466,277

"Hey all, I was on the Tickemaster pre-queue and then normal queue and eventually I got to purchasing tickets after waiting like 45 min. For those of you lucky peeps out there who randomly got placed higher on the queue, hopefully you got tix for the price they were advertised for, because by the time I got purchasing tickets, the prices SHOT UP. Early sound check tickets went from $253 to $350+. The WORST part is that as I about to buy 3 tickets so I could sit together with friends, my page automatically refreshed for some reason and I was KICKED OUT OF THE QUEUE, forcing me to wait even longer to get to the purchase screen. I didn't bother after that. Just as I was about to give up hope I literally google searched ""blackpink Inglewood tickets"" and the first site that popped up was Vivid Seats. Without any research I looked up if there were any tix available and I managed to snag 3 GA4 SRO tickets at $348 each (after ticket fees). That's way more than I'd hoped to spend, but seeing as this is their American debut I went for it. Has anyone here had experience with Vivid Seats? Or did the same thing I did and bought BP through there? I've read some other subreddits and people say Vivid Seats is legit, but just want to ask some more people. If it truly is legit, I suggest looking for some tix now before they shoot up even more!",1,1346,254

I just don‚Äôt understand why these websites let you raise the price. Even ticketmaster does it on their own resale site. The ticket should be only allowed to sell at face value. It‚Äôd be the easiest thing to enforce.,1,214,39
"So the whole ‚Äúoops someone beat you to it‚Äù is basically because ticketmaster has an incredibly horrible delay when a ticket gets purchased. So when lots of people buy tickets at the same time, Ticketmaster gets so lost that it goes ‚Äúhave this ticket....oh that‚Äôs my bad. It doesn‚Äôt exist anymore‚Äù",1,296,51

I think if you wait and as it gets closer to concert date the prices will drop. Should keep an eye out on the listings.,1,119,25
"&gt; Where should I buy the tickets from? Ticketmaster allows ppl to put up their tickets for resale and they're verified so it's the safest option. &gt; Is stubhub reliable? StubHub is safe they're owned by Ebay, they serve as a middleman for resellers. If the tickets end up being fake they will try to get replacements for you or give a refund. Sellers will be charged the value of the ticket sold if they sell fake tickets. &gt; Will tickets ever drop to fsce value? Resale tickets will always drop in value the closer the it gets to the concert date. Now whether there will be any tickets left that ppl are selling is another matter. Getting singles might be easier but 3 seats in a row would be harder. ",1,709,131

Red velvets show lasted from about 7-915 ish so I would say blank pink would also be for around 2 hours give or take.

As someone who has been listening to kpop since 1999, the thought of my favorites groups coming to the US, especially solo, was unheard of until the past couple of years. Who knows when they will be back, if ever? So that's pretty much always my mentality when I'm trying to buy tickets, especially to much more well known groups.",1,577,112

It's all hypothetical anyway. People are gonna buy scalped tickets no matter what. ",1,424,78
"It's pretty much known and been reported that TicketMasters actually colludes with resellers to bulk-purchase tickets and resell at higher prices on TM's site. They're practically a legalized scam. There are lawsuits pending, but I don't know much more than that. ",1,264,41
"Oooo same here I was calling, but was on hold too long, and decided to try again tmr. I'll definitely call them tmr now seeing that they put in a ticket for you! Thanksss :)!",1,174,35
"YG is also to blame. As most of you noticed, there was a thing called Official Platinum seats. These are tickets that are ""set aside for fans by **artists and event providers**."" So either YG or the event planners that work for YG specifically opted to hold tickets from circulation for the sole purpose of price gouging based on demand. This is why, when seats seemed to have sold out only to later come back as ""official platinum"", that the prices we're exorbitantly higher than original. I, personally, think this is bullshit and the fact that YG opted to do this is a slap to fans' faces.  ",1,594,107

I tried so hard to get a Soundcheck+GA ticket to NJ but kept missing out on it. So many people already reselling tickets while I was on ticketmaster trying to get regular tickets. There's gotta be a better way.,1,210,39
Ticket master was infuriating. They did so much to try to prevent bots and it ended up just slowing actual people down. I wish resellers weren‚Äôt taking from blinks who want to go and using it for profit. ,1,204,38
I just realized that the VIP tickets didn't mention anything about early access to merch (like the shows in Asia)... Do they sell merch at North American shows? Because I need to get a lightstick before they arrive at Hamilton lol.,1,231,41
"Had seven devices on an hour early, all trying to get tickets and only two got in before everything sold out. Ended up buying two P4 not next to each other for me and my friend but then 15 min later got P2 next to each other which was my first choice! Thank goodness my friend didn‚Äôt panic like I did and kept refreshing. Resold the P4 tickets at original price since every blink deserves to go and not destroy their wallets. Can‚Äôt wait! But also this was so stressful would not look forward to doing this again...",1,514,98
On the app you can choose your search preferences. Make sure it doesnt include resell tickets and i think thatll help,1,117,21

"It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs happened to every BP concert. Every single huge trending band or singer will have people using bots to bulk buy tickets and resell at 2-3x the price.

Anyone is selling 2-3 tickets?,1,30,5
What‚Äôs the designation on the GA tickets between sound check and P1? ,1,69,12
Ye I didn‚Äôt even get tickets. When it said do u wanna butter it said someone else got them. Such a trash system ,1,112,23
"Fuck scalpers dude. I joined the pre-queue 10 minutes before the sale and my cousin joined after me. She got past the queue 10 minutes in, and I waited 40 minutes before I even got in and by then all the tickets were gone. My cousin spent 20 minutes trying to buy tickets, bought them, re enter the queue and STILL got back in before me. Ticketmaster sucks! ",1,358,68
I'm dumb and I paid 313 dollars for the floor when they had available seating closer for 250 but at least I get to go lol,1,121,26

"Would their tour be considered a flop if it's sold out, but there are empty seats? They've gotten their money regardless if people are there or not. The only people who would be harmed financially for empty seats would be the scalpers. Maybe it'll show the companies that don't have fan protection at ticket sale that this system is broken. Kcon last year had a staggered release of tickets. That helped a lot in securing them since I kept checking back. Idk how badly those tickets were screwed by scalpers and bots as well though. Also, I understand that kcon is bigger than BLACKPINK so it was more warranted. I just wish there was a better system in place to buy tickets. ",1,676,122

"Honestly, I hate that for every single show that I try to go to, tickets are instantly up for resale. Is there any way to let YG know about how ridiculous the ticket sale is going? I know they probably won't care, but maybe if enough people let BLACKPINK and their organization know, they may void tickets, refund them and have another sale date? I know it's practically impossible, but I at least want them to know about the frustration we feel. I was still at work trying to buy tickets, so that put me at an extreme disadvantage. I'm happy for people who legit wanted to see them and got tickets. However, tickets shouldn't be able to go up for resale within the first hour of sale. Those people never intended to go to the show and are only preying on the fans. Idk, I'm just venting, but I'm really upset that I won't get to go to their show. I honestly hope they'll be able to do another show. I'm willing to even buy face value tickets for a same day show. Scalpers and bots would have a harder time flipping those, I would hope",1,1035,197
"It isn't just the artists. Ticketmaster is owned by Live Nation. Live Nation owns resale marketplaces. Live Nation also promotes tours. So Live National literally makes money for a tour happening, takes a cut when TM originally sells a ticket, then takes another TWO BIGGER cuts when a ticket resales. They have a vested interest in the resale marketplace. It's not just bots and individual people looking to flip tickets. Live Nation's resale market buys tickets from itself (ticketmaster) and sells them for more. Now that being said, I expected these tickets to have a higher face value than they did. I wound up paying about $80 more than face for floor tickets but were still less than what I anticipated paying up front.",1,726,124
My cousin in Atlanta was trying to get tickets and said on Stubhub they were $450-$1000!! How is that possible??,1,112,20
"Yeah unfortunately it's a problem not limited to Blackpink but every artist with large demand. Few artists would try to go out of their way to make sure fans got tickets, it takes a lot of efforts and resources to implement.

Fuck ticketmaster. Fuck scalpers.,1,33,4
"It depends on demand. If demand keeps going up (all seats are sold out and many people are still looking and actively buying from resellers) then the price will inflate a lot, especially in the immediate post-bloodbath (so unless you find a great deal from a fellow fan who just bought an extra ticket and ISN'T trying to make an easy buck, I'd wait till much closer to the concert, or at least for a few weeks). Oftentimes scalpers overestimate demand and in that case if it gets really, really close to the concert (like a few hours before), prices will drastically drop to even way way waaaaay below the original official selling price. &amp;#x200B; Ideally, if you live near the concert venue and don't have to fly out and book a hotel and you aren't completely die-hard on going to this concert, I'd say the best deal you'd get is to check ticket prices the day of the concert.

"If you're logged in, and in the pre-queue I don't think so. It definitely won't help, it may lose your place in line.

In trying to circumvent the queue, I left a page open from before the sale with the queue on it, never refreshed it or changed it, but in another tab, if I would click ""see tickets"" it would pull up the same queue page with the same tracker icon and the same queue ID. I even went through several captchas trying to look at like Newark to see what re-sale tickets were going for. You lose the queue if you back out of the pre-queue page. Like if you only have the one page open and you back out of it, you lose your place in line. If you straight refresh it, I'm not sure, but I wouldn't risk it. If you want to try and screw around with refreshing and stuff, just duplicate the tab and look around in the second tab.

For the LA pre-que it was more like 10 minutes before 4:00,1,58,12
"Pre-queue showed up ~15 minutes before the on-sale, But the pre-queue is randomly sorted at the on-sale time, so even if you hit pre-queue before anyone else you could end up like 7,000 in line. If you join the queue at the on-sale or later, you go to the back of the line. You're queue is tied to a cookie, so if you're logged in you stay in place. I didn't understand at first and tried refreshing, and re-joining and trying to get around it, but it always came back up the same, their is a unique ID tied to it. But people are right about multiple devices/accounts because I tried in incognito after 4 and ended up at the back of the queue in the incognito window but not the window where I was logged in, even after refreshing. So, in summary, join the pre-queue any time before the on-sale time and then just cross your fingers. I joined pre-queue and had to wait 50 minutes and not many face value tickets were left.

Imagine if you got stuck in traffic and got the website at 4:05. When I finally got in, there were already seats in the same section being resold at $560 when the tickets were $200 to start. Madness. If you didn't get a ticket I'd recommend waiting a little bit before looking for re-sells.

YUP. Refreshed the page at 4:01 after my first page stalled out and there were already 2000+ people ahead of me. Expecting the worst at this point.,1,147,27
2k+ with limited availability 6 minutes in for LA. RIP. ,1,56,10
As cool as it would be I don‚Äôt think Ariana Grande would do it unless Blackpink becomes well known in the west. ,1,112,22

"How did it double up like that in price?? Mine didn't do that, but I will say the ""convenience fee"" is way too high. How is paying for a digital copy so high, it makes no sense.

Are GA tickets only mailed if you buy them through the website? ,1,64,12
"Lucky you, 2000+ on each platform. Garbo ticketmaster at it again",1,65,11

In the pre-queue on 3 browsers for LA...,1,40,8
AXS showed maximum of 8 tickets for one check out,1,49,10
Yeah I had a buddy grabbing me tickets from his home and we were on the phone. He got in first and got 217 row 9. Then all of a sudden I got in so he didn't purchase the tickets yet as I got 215 row 4 so I got slightly better tickets which we didn't want to lose haha.,1,268,60
I got two P2 308 locations for $360. Convenience fee came to $45 and I did pay for the insurance thing just in case.,1,116,24
"Okies! Thanks for the reply. Got in, I guess it came later even though Ticketmaster said 30 minutes before.",1,107,19
"Not necessarily. Usually they would show standard tickets first, and then best available remaining tickets if standard tickets were sold out. If it was the first thing that popped up for you, it probably means there were no other standard tickets left so the next best thing came up for you.",1,291,51
Lmao that was unexpected,1,24,4
I did DFW so AXS. But ticketmaster should be similar but might start a later time.,1,82,16
damn so if I hadn't clicked premium I could've gotten the same tickets at the normal price?,1,91,17

I think it starts at 5 min mark or so.,1,38,10
It's basically Ticketmaster/AXS's tickets dynamically priced based on demand. So a different kind of scalping but it's technically legitimate so...,1,147,20
I think I got premium... what does that even do,1,47,10
maybe you should flex a bit on 'em and reap the benefits,1,56,12
"I got tickets in Fort Worth. 3 different devices. I got it and it said tickets unavailable. I had to keep going to the ticket page. Eventually I didn't even have to wait in a queue, just had to do the captcha. Finally got it and it gave me 2 options. Some sort of randomizer and also P2. I just kept it on P2 and clicked okay over and over until I got some seats. I wanted the closer P2 seats but I wasn't going to risk it.",1,423,88

I was on the site an hour earlier and didnt manage to get seats for Atlanta :/,1,78,17
It loos like VIP might be seated? The seating chart is confusing.,1,65,12
Ok I spent way more than I planned but I actually managed to get tickets on StubHub!,1,84,17
Awesome! Thanks. I'll check it out when I'm down there. ,1,56,10
Yep! I purchased 3 at once,1,26,6
"Also, do you know what the waiting room looks like for Ticketmaster? Not seeing any button or sign for it",1,105,20

"Damn. Yeah, Ticketmaster is straight bullshit. I'm glad most of the other music I listen to plays small enough venues that they don't use Ticketmaster. I also didn't really believe that there would be this kind of demand. I know scalpers pull tons of tickets, but these were big arenas and looking at the re-sells for Newark right now, it seems like scalpers still only took a fraction of the seats. ",1,400,71
"So happy I got VIP for Newark. I‚Äôm shocked I got tickets, I was in the queue for over an hour. ",1,95,21
2 had same log in. the rest were not logged in. The one that was 1st I had to log in when i bought the tickets. ,1,112,26

Does anyone know if they‚Äôre selling official t-shirts at the NA tour stops? ,1,76,13
Yeah that was lowkey worry me. üòÇ They should've worded the ticket differentiation better but I check too and i got the $403 BLINK VIP. ,1,135,25

No problem! ,1,12,2
"So I was stuck in the queue for over an hour for Chicago. However, when I got in, I saw SEVERAL vip Ga tickets for about $403. It's a frustrating queue for sure, but the fact that I wasn't constantly told ""OOPS SORRY PICK ANOTHER TICKET"" was actually good. ",1,257,49
thats the beat news thank you!!,1,31,6
"Same here! I was worried cause the tickets just say GA admission but on the app, in fine print, it says Blink VIP. I'm so excited! ",1,131,26

Even though I can't really afford $300 for tickets I decided to treat myself and have an amazingly cathartic experience after everything I've been through. I was in the pre-queue well before the sale opened, and when I got in there were still a lot of tickets left (including standard GA). I tried to buy GA repeatedly and got errors, I tried every other seat I could see and got errors. Error after error, over and over again as the seating chart showed seats disappearing. I was not able to buy any tickets at all. Now the seating chart is lit up with red resale tickets, it seems like 30-40% of the stadium is available from 'verified resellers'.

I also think it's so dumb how all the remaining seats can only be bought in pairs so someone doesn't have to sit by themselves. Wtf? What if the group has an odd number of people? And how is not being able to see them at all better than the experience of sitting in separate groups?,1,282,56

"So if you're waiting in the pre-queue when the queue starts. You're randomly mixed into this big queue and can either be next in line or have to wait a bit. If you refresh while in the queue, you will automatically be put to the back of the line. However, I recommend opening your ticketmaster about 10 minutes before and at about 2 minutes, refresh the timer. Because that will give you the option to join the pre-queue. The button didn't come up automatically for me. After that, sit back and wait. As for refreshing the tickets. Ticketmaster is the wooooorst with updating their tickets (plus here in Canada ticketmaster actually crashed and then sold out). So once you select tickets it'll probably go ""oops those arent available"" and then you can click to try again nearby. Sometimes that works (like yesterday when I bought Alexisonfire tickets. RIP my wallet these past two days), sometimes you just have to move on and try another set (how it worked for me today). That's up to your discretion.",1,1002,176

Whether you join the queue 1 hour early or 1 minute before makes no difference. But once you're in the queue don't refresh. It may seem long but it is slowly advancing and eventually you should get there. I went through it for Hamilton and got lucky but it can definitely take awhile.,1,284,53

Did you try StubHub? I couldn't get them on AXS for Atl too but I bought them very easily on Stubhub?,1,101,21
"After queuing for tickets, I got a message ""There are currently no tickets available"", then I reloaded the page, and boom -- SEATS. Good luck everyone!",1,151,26
"I got a ticket for 122, what's your opinion of the view in that area? Any pros/cons? ",1,85,17
"Don't know if this has been mentioned but if anyone is not able to get tickets on axs. I would try StubHub, I just purchased tickets there very easily.",1,151,29
I was going for ATL. But that‚Äôs a dubb now. For some reason it seems like ATL was the most popular location ,1,108,22
"And I agree with you. I like BlackPink, but I'm not paying $1200+ for two tickets. My wife would kill me.",1,105,21
I already accepted my defeat ü§£,1,30,6
I am about to give up. Find a seat and it's no longer available lol,1,67,15
"They varied but I would try StubHub, just bought tickets from there very easily.",1,80,14
cuz they tryna trick us!! It YG‚Äôs scheme lmao ,1,46,9
You too!! Which show are you going to?,1,38,8
"That happened to me, it was really annoying.",1,44,8
When I added them to the cart they were still face value. WTF is that about? Why would they triple in price at checkout?,1,120,24
i keep getting no tickets available,1,35,6
Same happen to me. Oh well enjoy lol,1,36,8
I got the BLINK VIP in Chicago and I'm just so happy I was able to get it! I'm a mess right now!! &lt;3,1,103,24
Stubhub isn't an official ticket broker - it's used for secondary sales.,1,72,12
I don't know what happened to me but i managed to get chicago tickets in 3 minutes??? Was aiming for P2 but accidentally got P1 tickets and when I realized what I had done I was already checking out so... I'm going broke lol,1,224,44
Hi! I'm in Dallas! And just got tickets! I'd be down to hangout before the show! ,1,81,16
"Ohmygod the same thing happened to me. They‚Äôre most likely Platinum tickets - better seats. Kind of pissed that we weren‚Äôt told there would be more tiers of pricing within the sections, I was only looking at the seat maps provided by the tour site. I grabbed two tickets quick and when I was paying I was like WHY ARE THESE THREE TIMES AS MUCH?! I went for it still, they‚Äôre great seats but DAMN it was expensive",1,412,78
Double? Oh please the prices went up at least 300% percent and I refuse to pay $1100 hundred dollars lol,1,104,20
Does anyone AXS tickets not show up on the upcoming events tab?,1,63,12
I saw tickets for ATL on stubhub so I had to double check ,1,58,13
Seems like ATL and DFW are both on atx,1,38,9
"It is now 5:18pm. +1 hour after on-sale time for Atlanta. Oddly enough, I am seeing tickets pop-up on the AXS site and multiple times I have clicked on the ticket and added it to my cart only to see the price of the ticket double or triple when I got to checkout. WTF?!",1,269,54
"Huh! Idk why AXS had the countdown for the other concerts until two hours ago when they didn't plan to sell them, but this is good to know. Thanks!",1,147,29
Off topic but aren't P1 tickets around $200? Why am I getting $500 haha,1,71,14
This queue system is bullshit. What happened to fastest click in the west? At this point I'm sure Chicago is sold out. Hopefully scalpers won't be asking too much. ,1,164,29
Ticket sales map as of 2:10pm [ ,1,32,7
"I just bought a ticket for Fort Worth through AXS, no problem. Going by the tour announcement I believe that LA, Chicago, Hamilton, and Newark were primarily through Ticketmaster; and Atlanta and Fort Worth were AXS.",1,216,36
"An hour later, I finally got in...aaaaand only resale tickets are available, starting at $169. ",1,95,15
It‚Äôs disgusting that the venue could allow this. People are going to have to pay up to 3 times the original price from scalper sites what a rouse. ,1,147,28
"As per what people have been saying I tried Seatgeek to purchase two tickets pretty easily for a reasonable price 200+, Ticketmaster is still being pretty crappy for me no matter how hard my guy runs T.T ",1,204,37
"I was looking at LA and that's the one that dropped suddenly for me. Maybe they just had the countdown but had no plans to sell them there? Either way, good to know. Thanks!",1,173,34
"I reserved 2 good tickets at a good price, accidentally hit Back, and lost them. Now there are no decent tickets available. &amp;#x200B; Nice!",1,142,24
for real?? Jesus. Why would anybody but $650 platinum tickets in the upper deck when there were $400 VIP packages available? SMH! Thanks for the info,1,149,26
Yeah I just found out about StubHub and bought them from there!!,1,64,12
Only Atlanta and I think somewhere else were being sold on axs. Everywhere else is on ticketmaster!!,1,100,17
Have you been to that arena before? I don't think I've ever been there. It looks to be primarily used for concerts and hockey which makes it seem smaller than a normal arena. I bet there's not a bad seat in the house. ,1,218,43
"platinum is ticketmaster reselling the tickets on their own platform for higher prices and calling it ""platinum"" it's total bullshit ",1,133,20
I was very much hoping for GA but I‚Äôll take what I can get!,1,59,14
"1 hour and counting, still lists 2000+ ahead of me, I am about 80% down the little guy moving line... ugh. I despise resellers.",1,127,24
"I haven't, but have had friends who have bought/sold successfully. I was sure to buy the insurance, too, just in case, but that's an extra $10 per ticket. It's supposed to be an electronic transfer through AXS's own app, Flash Seats, but who knows. Hopefully this isn't a huge disappointment - bought the ticket's for my daughter's birthday.",1,341,58
"Omg, I just booted up my computer because I had in my phone the tix going on sale at 5 instead of 4. I'm not sure if I would be angrier in this situation or if I had actually missed out at the right time. :') Looks like it's the resale market for us!!",1,251,54
"Same here, every time I try to checkout with tickets the page won't load. Their system must be really overwhelmed with viewers right now but that's no excuse, lets still be hopeful though :)",1,190,34
"Ever bought through StubHub before? Would you recommend, even though I know it's not the first choice...",1,104,17
im so emotional right now wow this is pure stress,1,49,10
"Same here. Waited an hour prior to the queue opening, no notification anything was available...and now i'm waiting here for almost an hour watching this bar barely move.",1,169,28
"That's so disappointing. I thought the ""Waiting Room"" was supposed to help clear from bots. Sad. :(",1,99,17
"I wasn't able to get tickets through AXS, either. As soon as I was let in through the waiting room, the tickets I selected already sold out before the page refreshed. :( I just bought through StubHub. ",1,201,37
Anyone else have a problem with the Seating Map just not loading up after the queue? By the time I got a map to appear everything I clicked on was already sold.,1,160,32
I got an Atl ticket but I cringe to even check to see what the resellers are trying to pull. ,1,93,20
351 people on front of me for 10 minutes now. Losing hope ,1,58,12
"I got the Blink VIP package.. I didn't understand what the Platinum ones were... but 650 is a bit much. The ones I saw weren't even on the floor. Are there box seets or something? Anyway, all I cared was early entrance! SO STOKED FOR THIS!!",1,240,46
Just got mine!! 2 in section 108!! üéâüéâ,1,37,8
Bummer-- but thanks for the heads up! ,1,38,7
Scalpers took all the tickets. I called the arena and they said they were already in checkout bins the moment they went on sale. That should be illegal. ,1,153,28
"I really am sorry, I‚Äôm sure if you looked on social media or on the websites you might be able to buy resales. Best of luck! Sry again",1,134,28
So stub hub isn‚Äôt officially selling tickets for ATL??,1,54,9
"same here, sorry man.",1,21,4
"It's good, congrats on the tickets!!!",1,37,6
We thought that they wouldn‚Äôt sell out quick either but we were wrong. I had to get my friends theirs because they couldn‚Äôt get on the site. It was insane.,1,155,30
"Not that anyone can do anything to really fix it, but the fact that some of us are still stuck waiting while StubHub already has a TON of tickets up for resale really grinds my gears. Sigh.",1,189,37
"I‚Äôm so sorry, I had to refresh and refresh and barely got tickets. I had to buy my friends‚Äô because they couldn‚Äôt get on. ",1,122,24
Yup I just got VIP too! ,1,24,6
Which venue?,1,12,2
"In there now, only P3/Standing GA/Sound Check/VIP package left.",1,63,9
"Nope. Got in the queue before 4 PM, got access to view tickets around 4:10, and even after 30 mins, TicketMaster wouldn't let me select just one ticket to even put in my cart. I'm monitoring SeatGeek and StubHub, tickets I saw on TM are being sold for at least 2x the cost on these sites. All standards price tickets sold out, and all I could do is watch them disappear. ",1,371,71
Is everyone in the same queue?,1,30,6
"They were available, looks like other sections were being sold at surge prices or whatever they call it",1,103,18
This makes me super nervous for BTS next week....,1,49,9
"for real, Bigbang, red velvet, epik high and bts were all easier!",1,65,12
"Was in the queue for a while but then decided to look other places. Found some on stubhub for a decent price. Got two tickets in section 210, by the time I got in on Ticketmaster everything cheap was gone. Glad I'm able to go even though the seats aren't the greatest!",1,268,52
"I joined queue for NJ at 3:30 and I'm still waiting to get in, lol. my guy's moved almost halfway down the line now but it still says 2000+ ahead of you",1,152,32
"same here, it looks like scalpers got to it first sadly",1,55,11
Download the app. I had been in queue on my computer before my phone and was only able to get tickets through the app on my phone. Good luck! &amp;#x200B;,1,154,30
I would to know this as well. Seems it‚Äôs like a 50/50 shot. At best. IF THAT. Did Anybody get tickets?,1,102,21
My ticket is in P1 seating. Section 116. I think row E. I wanted a seat in section 106/107/116/or 117. ,1,103,20
"I think that's what happened to my friend, she made it in a few times but then it crashed. She did eventually get a VIP ticket though so hooray! You're right though, it looks totally sold out now. Joined queue for GA just for shits and giggles and I got the sold out message.",1,275,54
"I got 2 for soundcheck out of shear luck. Every time I‚Äôve used Ticketmaster before it would just crap out on me, as recent as red velvet. Keep trying! ",1,151,29
"Yup, the refreshing was crazy. Had to change rows sooo many times. But yes, don‚Äôt give up!",1,90,17
See you seven there ,1,20,4
"Got one! Only took 30+ minutes in the queue. Honestly, it was easier to get BTS tickets ;)",1,90,18
Got lucky and qued up 20 minutes early still only able to get P2. Still I‚Äôm excited!,1,84,17
"I got in but all the tickets are being sold at a platinum price, pretty much Ticketmaster scalping the good tickets. Sec 9 at $600+ each",1,136,26
I'm rather unimpressed with AXS and their ability to handle transactions. It also would have been nice to know that you could queue up before 4pm. ,1,147,26
My dude moved a whole bunch. I am getting nervous excited,1,57,11
My lil dude just moved to right under the P in People ,1,54,12
The place actually became a Samsung showcase for the S9 place after BP House ended.  ,1,85,15
I feel like no matter how much my guy moves the number of people in front of me never changes lol,1,97,21
Atlanta sold out in 10 minutes. Got lucky to get P2!,1,52,11
"Friend just got in a lot of tickets were still available, including sound check",1,79,14
"I got mine! Sec 122, Row 9 I was torn between that and standing but it seems like a really good middle ground. It took me a while to get in but keep refreshing, lots pop up!",1,173,37
I got VIP tickets and my friend just got VIP tickets too right now so there's still a chance if you're in queue!,1,112,23
Nooo! I thought I was early and it still sold out! Guess I'll have to buy from scalpers/resale now...,1,101,19
thats just not fair idk why it didn't pop up on its own? I was already there for over an hour. Welp next time I'll know to refresh at the 30min mark.,1,149,32
"That‚Äôs so annoying, I thought this system was to get rid of bots and scalpers. ",1,79,15
How do I know if I am no in queue for Chicago???,1,48,12
See you in Hamilton!! üòÜ,1,23,5
I'm still sitting at over 2000 people also.... üò≠üò≠,1,49,9
I got tickets 4 times for Atlanta and I couldn't even pay!!! I used 4 different credit cards and there was an error for all of them and I lost each of the tickets!,1,163,34
"Not far, but he moved!",1,22,5
My dude just moved!,1,19,4
I feel for you. I got shutout of Atlanta as well.,1,49,11
what seats were left?,1,21,4
I got my tickets in P1. üëåI got in after having 2000+ in front of me during the queue. Be careful of clicking on a platinum ticket - it has its prices inflated due to demand and it‚Äôs just a ticket. ,1,197,41
"I was on site hour before, in queue 15 min. Went and refreshed page, site crashed, had to literally click hundreds of times for best available seats to get GA Tix. In the meantime waiting to pay, I had another tab that refreshed and said it was all sold out. It's fucking insane and I hate this site. ",1,301,58
im scared to ask but was soundcheck still available ,1,52,9
AYYY I got the seats I wanted with my friends! 3 of them in section 219!!,1,73,16
"Are you serious? I'm on my phone and when it finally got to the captcha prompt, i do the stuff it asks me to do, and then i get another prompt, but it wont let me click on the checkbox to try again. I'm afraid to refresh! Not to mention my laptop went all blue screen while i was in queue. UGH!!!!!",1,298,62
Yep same exact situation as you. :-(,1,36,7
exact same thing happened to me,1,31,6
"And there are 1,845 tickets already on Stubhub. Definitely not a coincidence.",1,77,12
thats me as well,1,16,4
"I got lucky with only about 500 people ahead of me, but I secured my ticket. sadly when I got in, the better seats in the upper level were gone.",1,144,30
I was stuck waiting like that for 10 minutes and finally got in. Didn't get the exact tickets I wanted but still got p2,1,119,24
"still stuck, 2000+ people in front of me (had no idea about pre-queue)",1,70,13
"Ugh. Totally crushed. Tried to get my daughter 2 tickets to the ATL show, got in the waiting room as soon as it opened, and it sold out before we could get some. Was going to be a great first concert for her.",1,208,43
Looks like Atlanta is sold out. ,1,32,6
"Ah, another soldier in this war. ",1,33,6
I'm not sure. I'm actually baffled by how painless it was. I will note it was on my laptop through a web browser. I had the phone app too... that wouldn't load at all. ,1,168,34
still stuck in the queue,1,24,5
I watched the video just now to see if I could find out what the username was. Turns out that the name of the caf√© is printed on the cakebox on one of the pictures. So the blurring makes no sense. [ ,1,199,42
when mine finally loaded they were sold out. good luck,1,54,10
More: I clicked on the Chicago link on axs. It gives you a redirect link to Ticketmaster so you're good. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;,1,130,22
i will give you a heads up that i tried getting VIP for atlanta to see how much of a headache it will be and it took 20 minutes of refreshing but i finally was able to get a ticket in my cart. so i‚Äôm hopeful it goes well for dallas. GOOD LUCK BLINK!!! apparently the prequeue for fort worth opens at 3:30 on the ticket purchasing page! so get ready for that!,1,358,73
My guy hasn't moved for the past 10 mins.,1,41,9
I'm stuck in the queue too. Terrible system. I'm not optimistic but we've waited this long already so we might as well stick it out.,1,132,25
"Good decision! Even though its a joke, I'm torn between this and the new Xiaomi.",1,80,15
I'm still gonna wait in this line just in case... but it's not looking too bright. Hopefully they just add more shows,1,117,22
"Oh boy, that fits perfectly! I can't even remember this scene from BP House.",1,76,14
Y‚Äôall are making me nervous for LA,1,34,7
didn‚Äôt get mine too many people were in front of me :(,1,54,12
omg thanks for the info. I'm going to have AXS ready just in case &amp;#x200B;,1,78,15
"Ugh, I'm so afraid I'm not gonna get a ticket. Been in queue for over 20 mins and I'm on 1/4 the way. ",1,102,23
thats me alright &amp;#x200B;,1,29,4
"Got in the VIP line as soon as it opened up, and when my queue finished it said no tickets available :|",1,103,22
I‚Äôm a first time kpop buyer for fort worth too! I hope my group can snag some tickets before they sell out super quickly. Best of luck to everyone!,1,147,29
Confirm: No Atlanta date on Ticketmaster. I see the Illinois date on TM and axs so plan accordingly. ,1,101,18
"lol literally me! I'm not taking any customers at 4pm. If needed, I have my phone ready and logged in to ticketmaster, just in case I have to ""excuse myself to the bathroom"" &amp;#x200B;",1,186,34
"[  ""Are we sponsored by Samsung?"" ""Oh Yes!""",1,43,8
same... crying right now...,1,27,4
2000+ ahead of me still This system is a mess. I had similar issue with Epik High,1,81,17
I think it varies depending on which venue. Some I think are selling them at both spots but I can't be sure. Let me check to see if there are ticketmaster dates for Atlanta. I can confirm that mine came through axs for Atl. ,1,224,44
axs kept redirecting me to ticketmaster? how did u..?,1,53,9
Oh ok! That‚Äôs super cool.,1,25,5
"Same thing happened to me. I loaded the Ticketmaster page 50 mins early but few mins before the tickets went live, I wanted to look at the seating chart. I clicked on a link accidentally from the venue's website and it bought me to pre-queue which I'm probably too late for.",1,274,51
This is kind of insane. I did everything super fast and i'm still in queue. I expected high demand but this is beyond my expectations. ,1,135,25
i guess i‚Äôll throw my iphone away for a samsung ,1,48,10
"I've made it past the wait queue twice on both the AXS app and on my PC, and both times it craps out after that.",1,112,25
What city were you trying for? What website? ,1,45,8
Jennie said she really loves the cake designs created by that pastry chef and she follows her on SNS. Anyone know the account for that pastry chef? Can't seem to find it and they blurred it out in the episode. ,1,210,40
"Nah, I got tickets. In the best possible seating for P4, too, dead in the center. Sorry to hear about Georgia. Keep refreshing!",1,127,23
This isn't a commercial. It's the reveal of the Galaxy S10 in a 2 hour long presentation. ,1,90,17
"I didn't know anything about pre-queue‚Äîwas on the page 1+ hours before, now there's 2000+ people ahead of me in line! ",1,118,21
"Hopefully not too late to save you. All tickets for the Georgia concert were gone within 4 minutes. Missed my chance because I wanted to see exactly where in the venue my ticket was going to place me, because of course we can't have that information displayed on the same screen as seating information.",1,302,54
"I didn't get tickets. I'M INFURIATED. Are there scalpers? Do you think they might add more dates? Because I am losing my mind right now. I had EVERYTHING planned, I did EVERYTHING right, and I didn't get tickets. :( ",1,216,39
"No, it was the official launch event hold in San Fransisco with over 500k people watching live on youtube.",1,106,19
oh okay right :) ,1,17,4
It's local time so it's only 1pm right now.,1,43,9
"I SOMEHOW GOT A VIP TICKET. THEY SOLD OUT IMMEDIATELY??? my friend joined the queue before me and somehow I got a ticket and she didn't, we're trying to at least get her a GA ticket so she can try to squeeze her way up to the front with me but it's looking bleak T\_\_\_T still have 2000+ in front of me for the NJ show though which is a lot closer to me lmao (from VA!!)",1,371,77
"No issues here. I got the tickets I wanted. I was in the axs waiting room 30 minutes before... at 4, the page refreshed and boom. Tickets secured. ",1,147,28
"&gt;axs wait, are they selling them through ticketmaster or axs?",1,64,10
Note to you guys. I was able to get my ATL tickets no problem... and right where I wanted. If you're going through axs... they have a waiting room that pops up 30 minutes or so before they go on sale. Good luck Chicago!,1,219,44
Absolute madness this is,1,24,4
i don‚Äôt see it for LA? ,1,23,6
that sucks I was on the page 1 hour early and the pre-queue didn't pop up until the last minute? had no idea I was supposed to refresh yikes,1,140,29
Is this for the korean commercials only?,1,40,7
What is General - Onsale and AXS premium General admission which one should I queue for if I want P1 GA floor with soundcheck?,1,126,24
"the pre-queue is live on ticketmaster now, refresh your page if you're not already in it",1,88,16
Exactly. And no one is forcing people to buy VIP tickets. Really weird people are so caught up on price of VIP tickets. VIP tickets are always going to cost a bit more,1,167,33
"For anyone going to one of the shows that sells the tickets through AXS, you can start queuing up online now. I was able to preanswer the captcha.",1,146,28
You go to the web site 30 minutes before sales go live. You click on buy tickets. It brings you to a screen that says you are waiting in line. You sit there and look at that screen for 30 minutes. When time is up and you eventually get to the front of the line it automatically loads the page to choose seats and buy tickets. You can also use the ticketmaster app.,1,364,73
"If you are on the page, when the countdown reaches 30min prior you should be automatically entered. If not, refresh your page. If there's a button that you have to click to enter the waiting room, then click that (though I'm pretty sure this is an AXS thing, not ticketmaster). By the way, ticketmaster should assign you a random place in line if you're worried about not entering the queue right at 30min prior. &amp;#x200B;",1,425,75
From where? I haven‚Äôt seen an presales?,1,39,7
"For axs, the queue has already seemed to start for Atlanta!",1,59,11
"They will sell out within minutes. You're not just competing with Blinks, but with scalpers that will put tickets up for resale at four times the price. It's best to stay logged in and have all your information good to go. The rest is just up to luck really. I doubt the VIP packages will sell out quickly, if at all, because the profit margin for scalpers is less. But individual tickets will be gone very quickly.",1,415,77
"If you have GA Standing tickets but arent right at the stage in the beginning, can you make your way to it or is that kind of impossible?",1,137,28
Still won‚Äôt make it a good phone üò±,1,34,8
We are almost at the zero hour of tickets going on sale for the first NA tour! &amp;#x200B; T-minus 26 minutes. ,1,112,21

"Hamilton is a pretty sketchy city, and there really isn't much to see other than a few restaurants and maybe some parks. Nothing really special. I wouldn't change anything if it were me because I had a great experience sitting in line too. Everything was very organized",1,269,47
"Red velvet tickets sold out in 2 minutes, but more were available like 5 min later if you refreshed. The key here is to grab them asap, but if you dont get them, dont be discouraged, theres still a chance, refresh and try again. I'd recommend logging in now, making sure your cc info is inputted and use multiple devices if you have them available",1,347,65
GOOD LUCK!! i‚Äôm lucky enough to live only an hour from LA so the trip is pretty easy ^-^ and i got presale tickets!!!!,1,118,24
"We really don't know, but i would expect them to sell out rather fast. So be ready when they go live, that's the best bet. ",1,123,25
Have one already. Ugh. I may have to sneak home to buy the tickets and come back to work hahah! ,1,96,20
P1 GA is standing. Regular P1 is seated,1,39,8
I really wanted to see em up close so I‚Äôm hoping I get two! I saved up my paycheck just for this,1,96,22
No thanks,1,9,2
My anxiety is through the roof right now so I understand you ,1,61,12
No thanks.,1,10,2
I‚Äôm always checking back and forth Ticketmaster just to check‚Äî I‚Äôm kinda anxious about getting tickets for me and my sister!,1,124,21
i do get what you were trying to say now :) i'm all for healthy debate on reddit!,1,81,18
RIP to FT today,1,15,4
Try making a Ticketmaster account. ,1,35,5
I love that Jennie and Lisa made a Red Velvet cake,1,50,11
Did you all make an account with Ticketmaster? That might help. I made one and I‚Äôve been sitting on the countdown page for hours without issues ,1,144,26
Well ok maybe I should have worded that better as ‚Äúthe collab would probably be blocked because of the case of CL‚Äù. I‚Äôm really not trying to bring down CL because I do love her since 2NE1 era. That remark was really though made in sarcastic tone that any YG fanti could have a little chuckle. But it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs baseless.,1,325,62
I‚Äôd go with the link from the main part of the thread at this point:   I did see a ticket price range posted on the Infinite Energy site and it pretty much lines up with what the picture above shows. I hope you get good seats. ,1,227,46
"im sorry but i really dont see the point in making assumptions about how business tactics work while simultaneously bringing down an artist that us blinks are known for hating on unfairly... and everything you described would be the work of their managers and higher ups, not CL blocking something. there's countless reasons for this not happening and CL really wouldn't be our first concern.",1,392,65

"You have to realize it‚Äôs gonna be harder for BP to collab w Ari because CL is a factor in the equation. Scooter could probably flex and make the collab work only if CL, his other client, gets a chance for a comeback in return. YG holds the power on CL and her releases are dependent on YG, but Scooter and Ari has lots of freedom from their label and can certainly release stuff if they want to if Thank U Next was of any indication. ",1,434,86
"I think the GA soundcheck will be sold with the other regular tickets and the $400 dollar VIP ticket is to be sold with the Blink VIP Package. As for why I think this, the price ranges listed for tickets is $67.50 - $257.50. Now, going off the prices supplied from YG, the lowest should be 63.50 and the highest (GA+Soundcheck), 253.50. So if the lowest is $4 more, we assume that's a fee (service, tax, etc) and seeing as how the highest price is also raised the same, we can assume that the 257.50 listed in that range is the GA+Soundcheck ticket. As for AXS premium, one redditor once described it like this: &gt;For those planning on buying AXS premium tickets, it's essentially the same thing as Ticket master platinum tickets. AXS will sell you overpriced tickets in order to ""help"" you from getting scammed from third parties. Think before you purchase! They aren't special seats. They are regular seats which are sold to people who want the tickets, but the event sold out. If you have the money, go ahead, but, most of us don't have that much money. so I suggest you make sure you aren't spending money you don't have. So think of the AXS premium as a way of buying select (the supposed ""best"") seats from the pool of regular seats at different prices (depending on demand), rather than going in and selecting seats by yourself. This means that AXS premium could get you to the GA+Soundcheck easily. Or it could not. I've never tried it so proceed at your own risk. tl;dr The GA Soundcheck tickets can be purchased from the leftmost option, Tickets. AXS Premium is supposed to be an easier way to get the ""best"" seats, but its functionality is questionable. Please try to read some reviews before you decide to use it. Anyone who has good things to say about AXS premium, please contribute.",1,1799,323

"No thanks. I still don't like her since the donut licking incident. She appears to have embraced the Diva attitude--the same one that infected Christina Aguilera. They believe their own hype.

It's very difficult for most people to understand VIP. If everyone can afford it then it is not VIP. I am flying in out of state to watch the concert and I don't have time to camp from 10am to get to stand at the rails. I will pay for VIP if I can get it so I can be there upfront. So to me it is worth it. What is 150 more on a trip that is already close to 1k. ,1,363,82

GA tickets we're all gone by noon and VIP tickets like mine (soundcheck and sendoff) was still available in the early evening online. &amp;#x200B; TIP: If there are more than one place to buy tickets in your area, choose the one which will be less likely congested.",1,552,105

"It was the same wristband, only difference was that you had to show your electronic or physical ticket.

IIRC, they said the doors open at 11amEST to receive your Soundcheck Wristband, and we got there around 10am where there was about a 90 person lineup already. They did say that people would get kicked out if they were lining early, but almost every early rule they set in place wasn‚Äôt enforced. My sister and I got Wristband #77 and #78 which got us to Row #3, and by the time WINNER came out, everyone rushed to the front of the stage. It was pretty fun for the most part though lol. Planning was pretty shit because it was sub -30C weather, and they didn‚Äôt let us wait inside the ticket sales room (before entering the foyer).

[Ticketmaster Seat Chart](  So all the VIP, Floor GA (General Admission) and P1 GA will all have tickets on the floor (standing, no seats) Now VIP are the first to enter the venue followed by Floor GA as both come with sound check viewing. Next will be I'm guessing the rest of the ticket holders. So P1 GA will also be allowed on the GA floor, but wont be there for the sound check. P1 is for the first set of seats in the lower level. P2 is for the rest of seats in the lower level. P3 is for the first sets of seats in the 2nd level P4 is for the last set of seats in the 2nd level &amp;#x200B; I could be completely wrong on this, but like I said this is I think it goes. &amp;#x200B; Hope this helps &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;",1,858,173

"It‚Äôs not super far, I‚Äôd say about 30-50 feet. On the GA portion, there‚Äôs a ton of empty space behind where people stand, so there‚Äôs just an empty gap between the P1 area and the stage (with the people obviously congregated around the stage)",1,240,44

"My sister and I got sound check for WINNER‚Äôs show in Toronto and it was really good, though a bit too short for my liking. So essentially, what happened was that you line up early to get your wristbands to enter. Our wristbands were marked with a number on them. The earlier the better as you will be getting closer seats (1-100 100-200). We ended up coming back 2 hours later to line up again for the actual SoundCheck, at this point it doesn‚Äôt matter where you line up because they end up placing you in order. When it came down to the actual Soundcheck, the guys came out in their regular outfits and sang a few songs and interacted with the fans. TIP: They‚Äôll tell you not to take pictures and all that, BUT DO IT ANYWAYS lol. My phone broke a few minutes before this, and my regrettably sister forgot hers. We were so close I could see Seungyoon and Seunghoon‚Äôs acne scars lol. But the members were really interactive with the fans for the most part. And it was well worth the +$300CAD for it. It might be a little different for BlackPink‚Äôs as a result of having a larger fanbase, but i think it‚Äôll be similar for the most part. ",1,1134,214

"So I went to the BTS concert in Hamilton, and what they did was let the people with soundcheck in a couple of hours before the concert began and then let them back out after about 30 minutes. For reference: Soundcheck was around 2:30-3:00, we got in the concert at 4, and it started at 6. (This was for GA) People waited in line (regardless of whether they had soundcheck or not) for hours/days before they got their official number. Around 11am, we got our wristbands and then were able to walk around town till we got back in line at 2. There were separate sections after we got back in like that corresponded to the numbers by the hundreds (0-99, 100-199, etc.) I didn‚Äôt have soundcheck, but the people in line with me did and said it was amazing. A decent amount of eye contact, waving, and interaction too. Basically, people from soundcheck went in a separate line for about 20 minutes and came back to their corresponding place in the line to get into the venue ",1,968,178

"StubHub can be a good resource to get tickets to sold-out shows, but a lot of StubHub sellers pretty much prey on unexperienced, anxious ticket buyers. They're listed at overinflated prices before sale because they do plan on getting tickets, but they plan on you, the ticket buyer, absolutely striking out on ticketmaster/axs sales, feeling flustered and desperate, and deciding to drop $400 on their ticket, that they might not have yet. &amp;#x200B; Also there's talk that there are actual people employed by Ticketmaster that are in this scalping game too, so it could be those people for all I know. But yeah, never buy from StubHub before tickets actually go on sale, and if you can't get them on Ticketmaster, don't go looking on StubHub right away. Ticket prices there are going to fluctuate wildly between initial sale and the show date, and they're going to be the highest prices on sale day and about a week before the show.",1,935,161

"So, just so you know, Ticketmaster and AXS don't have the best of reputation when it comes to handling large amounts of traffic all at once and AXS is especially rated terribly in that regards. Some things to consider: * Multiple devices. Have the ticketing website open on multiple tabs (but not so many that it impacts your computer's performance) and as many computers, laptops and phones/tablets, etc you have. Ticketmaster will occasionally prevent you from using their website from specific devices (probably to prevent bots) so you'll have to switch to another device quickly. AXS just makes you use a recaptcha system to prevent bots so if you refresh multiple times be prepared for that to slow you down eventually. * Queuing. Both sites will allow you to enter a queue 30min before the saletime. Just to be safe, I'd recommend just having the site open at least an hour or more before the sale time and check periodically. If I remember correctly, while TicketMaster will enter you automatically (I could be wrong), AXS requires you to click a button. The sooner you enter the queue the better. Once you're in the queue, do not refresh the page. It'll automatically take you to the page when it's time. If you refresh you may lose your place. * Account. Make sure you have an account with a credit card saved on the account. Make sure you are logged in. This way you don't have to enter information while you are buying. It also helps to have a notepad/word doc open with all of your information already typed if you want to copy and paste. * Refresh. Don't be afraid to try over and over. I've heard stories of people trying for better tickets, continually refreshing for 8 hours after tickets went on sale. Good luck.",1,1729,305
do you guys think that VIP would be a fansign?,1,46,10
"1. i‚Äôm sure it will be difficult, but not impossible! just be patient and calm. if it keeps telling you there‚Äôs nothing left just give it a minute and don‚Äôt freak out. people are adding and removing tickets from their carts. tip: if you want GA, search for ‚Äòbest available‚Äô that way if GA doesn‚Äôt come up, you know there are none available at the moment, and you can decide if you would take the next best available seats it gives you. 2. for LA, they will be sold on ticketmaster! tip: use the app instead of the website as there will be less traffic and it‚Äôll move a little quicker. 3. give yourself about 15 minutes before on sale date to be situated and set up that way when they are on sale you can just click and go. tip: there MAY be a queue depending on how many people are trying to get tickets. i‚Äôve only seen this a couple of times. if there is it may let you queue early, just check every so often before the on sale date. if there is a queue do NOT exit out after getting in. 4. for ticketmaster, i believe the service fee is 20% of the ticket price. so since GA is $198.50, you‚Äôre looking at about a $40 service fee. then there will be a couple smaller fees such as facility, etc. i would say the final total will be somewhere between $250-300 EACH. there really is no way around this and is just something you‚Äôre gonna have to pay. best of luck!!! i‚Äôm buying for fort worth tomorrow. :)",1,1401,272

They‚Äôre pretty much a scam. They buy a bunch of tickets and resell them at double the value.

I believe the 3 colours just correspond to separate the seating levels and not the pricing tiers. When tickets go on sale the seats will be partitioned off accordingly by price. It wouldn't make sense for section 209 or 229 for example to be the same price as the other yellow sections b/c of it's bad viewing angle.,1,316,58

They were pretty popular in KR in 2017, but they skyrocketed from like a 55-85 once SQUARE UP released. I'm really curious as to what their songs are going to sound like. I was completely clueless as to what concept they could go for in SQUARE UP. And if they'll go for a double title track MVs or stick with the one title with a secondary title track without a MV. Judging from their schedule it looks like they won't be attending any of the University Music Festivals which happen in May.

With bigbang coming back from military this year i also hope that GD will write some songs for BP, i love teddy's songs but some GD material would be dope as well. Maybe even some collabs between bigbang and bp members in the future? Arguably YG's two biggest groups, it would break the internet and just imagine the digital performance in korea when bigbang and blackpink had something up their sleeves. I also wonder how well this upcoming comeback will do, i don't extremely care for all these youtube records in a vacuum, but it definitely gives some publicity because there are articles about it, blackpink had around 7M subscribers before their DDDD comeback and now we are at almost three times that. So we know it will be huge, but how huge exactly? I also did some research about blackpink's tour attendees and assuming they sell out (or close enough for it to not matter) they will be the 3rd gen girlgroup with the most sold tickets overall period. (and realistically they will still add at least one stop in australia) Pretty awesome if you ask me :O Other than that, hoping for some comeback confirmation soonish, hoping that blackpink diaries will be made for every stop they have in their worldtour and just hoping that 2019 will be BP's year :) ",1,1684,303

Ill just piggyback that comment because I work in an arena. They won‚Äôt let you in with a camelbak. Mainly because 1) most of them have just eliminated backpacks of any kind following the explosion at an Ariana Grande concert in the UK.

Favoritism? no favoritism can get you the success and the popularity that she has. you literally sound like a hater.

You're still painting her as lazy despite all the great performances that she gave recently. what a biased fake blink.,1,428,73

If you put them in roles that match their one character type, they shine. You try to put them in something else, like Shakespeare, it will be laughably bad. Goldblum is perfect in Jurassic Park, Independence Day, and Thor. If spaced out like that, he's great, but it is definitely easy to too much of him if he shows up multiple times a year or even once a year. &amp;#x200B; Based on the Youtube title, I expected to see a lot of BP but I think they were only on screen or heard their music for about 10 seconds. It's a shame they filmed multiple episodes of Colbert that night or they might have had time to interview BP. Hopefully with the album drop and the NA tour, we will get many North American interviews soon. It would also be great to see them back on Idol Room, KB, and other Korean variety shows promoting as well. Unlike Goldblum, you can never have too much Blackpink.",1,1019,188

I'm going to try to get as close as possible towards the front of the stage. I'm finding that the VIP packages don't include a meet and greet so I'll probably pass on that.

they perform some of their songs 2 or 3 times and they each did a cover of an english song and did their so hot cover by wonder girls. there was also a rock band (hired by the girls) to perform and back some of their songs.,1,223,47
I really don't mind them keeping the solo cover performances I hope they change the covers though. Concerts to me is getting the chance to see your favourite artist live in person and not so much about the songs as I already listen to their songs daily to death.,1,262,49

"3 hours is a lot more than 20 songs, I have my doubts about that (unless theres a lot of filler or talking segments. In my experience only the biggest artists have shows that long and theres usually a preshow too (Taylor swift was 2 hours but her preshow with Camila and Charlie xcx made it 3)",1,293,57
"Recently it was posted that the European leg is 3 hours compared to around 2 in Asia. So it may vary from place to place. I‚Äôll see if I can find the post (I‚Äôm on mobile, sorry).",1,177,37
Oh okay. Thanks for the information. It definitely helps a lot . ,1,65,12

I just finished watching and I enjoyed Blackpink House but I am already liking this so much better. My favorite part was when Jennie and Lisa were at the 7-11 store and Jennie was wanting to try things local's ate. And it was cute seeing Lisa's Dad there. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series!,1,302,57
Pretty much yes,1,15,3
We couldn't find anything so we ended up making a new discord server [  ,1,72,14
Nah bruv this was near the end of the concert,1,45,10

Yeah can someone reiterate what the send off is? And is YG strict when it comes to phones during soundcheck/vip perks?,1,118,21
I already miss them sighhh,1,26,5
I was there. It was awesome! Great job SG Blinks!! üíï,1,52,11
Beautiful people alert. ,1,24,3
Can someone explain what a send-off is? Do we just see them leave or?,1,69,14
Doea anyone know what the BP send off is for the VIP tickets? Are there any meet &amp; greet pic opportunities? I would get VIP if I could get a pic with them otherwise it doesnt seem worth it to me :(,1,201,42
Yeah I think I'll be alone. Everyone else has to work. But I'll still try on multiple devices. Thank you. ,1,106,20
"If you‚Äôre buying a lot, make sure you have people helping you in the same room. My cousin and I bought for 5 and we had 4 computers out. Mine was the only one that got in right away and was able to buy tickets.",1,210,45
Just release and yes there is ,1,30,6
Love this look so much!,1,23,5
"1. After the concert, there will be staff that will ask you to stay for the send off package. I‚Äôm not sure how the whole process works since I got the soundcheck one. 2. Well, this one depends on how the whole thing will be managed. As for the Asia tour, there was a queue number along with the ticket. Your queue number depends on the time of purchase of your ticket. I got #3 for the queue number and I was able to stay at the front then. 3. Well, I stayed at the letter B. But to be honest, most of their performances were at the main stage :/ although it‚Äôs your choice if you still want to watch them at the second stage since there are times that they will perform there. But they performed more on the main stage than the second stage. I‚Äôm not sure if the set list will change for the NA &amp; Europe tour since they will have a comeback next month. Most probably not.

uhmmm... Do Europeans get a digital EP copy aswell??,1,52,9
"Very happy that they are going to be making this a series because personally i find it very interesting to see behind the scenes footage like this and also because i really liked the vibe that this video had if that makes sense? Very down to earth yet professional and fast paced. Definitely looking forward to the rest of the episodes and like someone else said, i wonder if they'll make one episode for each city..hmm only time will tell, lookign forward to the rest!",1,469,85

"Hey guys, I'm new to this reddit, but I have been a Blink since their debut and this video makes me super happy! And please let this be a lead-in to the comeback! PLEASE! Quick question: does anyone know the Whistle remix at the beginning? Is there a way to find a full audio of it? ",1,283,56

"With BP getting really famous worldwide, having Jennie on the show can only drive up the rating. ",1,97,17
"They look so gooooooooooooood. And it was so natural, it really felt like we were there with them, as they were getting ready for the show. Jenshookt as per usual, she is so memeable. Same with Lisa and her little dances. I loved seeing them rehearse the dance, they all seemed so natural and in their own world, but you can see the work they put out. I also love seeing the behind the scenes on the people working to make sure the concerts are a success. We should all be grateful that they have an amazing team making sure they look and sound their absolute best. ",1,566,107
"YOOOOO!! I was just yesterday talking about wanting Blackpink House 2.0 and they come out with this! This might be even better, cause is not scripted and they can be a little crazy. I just wish it's as big as Blackpink House or even bigger. Can you imagine if we get something for Coachella as well? I would love to see the preparation the goes into. I just really missed them, being candid and just letting loose. It's been a while. Hopefully this is not going to be one per week, i don't know if i would be able to handle it. I need my Blackpink fix lol.",1,556,108

"As much as I LOVE THEM, I probably won‚Äôt buy the highest tier tickets. Seems kinda high when they don‚Äôt have many songs out yet, but I‚Äôll take the risk of them releasing a banger album, and coming back to Canada again :) ",1,221,43
I have no idea what they're doing or what the hell is going on. But I like it. ,1,79,18
Yeah VIP price is painful but they're usually reserved for die hard Blinks or ppl that are well off that don't even flinch at the price :),1,138,27
She's Indonesian.,1,17,2
"If the regular soundcheck tickets will include a lanyard too. The VIP sounds kinda worth too, but man, 524.50CAD, is gonna be painful af, including the plane ticket there.... ",1,175,29

"Anyone know what‚Äôs included in the VIP Blink Package? The price (524.50CAD?) seems crazy, but if I get a chance to meet them, that sounds worth it.",1,147,27
"I didn't think I could be more of a fan. This felt so natural and ""diary-like"". I had a grin during the entire video along with a couple of laughs. The maknae line (Rose and Lisa) was so quirky and funny LOL, particularly with their interaction with Brandon. Jennie getting scared easily again, and I loved her interest into Lisa's hometown lifestyles. ",1,353,62
LOL at Jennie flipping the f--k out when the sound comes on,1,59,12

"Thanks that‚Äôs useful to know, lol. (FWIW I‚Äôm below the average female Canadian height but above average for an Asian female. üò¨) Part of the reason why I‚Äôd prefer not to get a standing ticket is that I‚Äôll be going with a friend who‚Äôs not a Blink and I don‚Äôt want them to feel pressured into having to spend as much as me just because I‚Äôm obsessed. But I‚Äôll definitely keep the info about the standing area in mind in case the girls come back in the future..",1,456,88
I was wondering if they‚Äôre gonna do this like how they did for Jennie‚Äôs SOLO. LOVE IT!,1,86,17
"Thanks, this is very helpful! (I forgot to indicate my prices were the CAD ones for Hamilton lol. üòÖ) As a working adult with disposable income and no dependants, I was prepared to pay for VIP... just not standing tickets since I‚Äôll be with a friend who‚Äôs not a Blink and I don‚Äôt want to pressure them just so I can get fed. If I was alone... oh I definitely would get the VIP. üòÜüí∏",1,379,75
Is the send off area exclusive to VIP?,1,38,8
BUT I WAS A STICK BUT I WAS A STICK,1,35,10
Hmm sounds like a perfect opportunity. Will be on PCS leave from Korea around that time.,1,88,16

yes omg thats the price i was PRAYING for,1,41,9
That's what happens when the economy is all in on natural resources.,1,68,12
Hopefully they wear outfits like the last picture here for coachella. Seems like it would fit with the festival scene more than most of their stage outfits.,1,156,27
VIP is the standing area close to the stage like the red area [here](  If you come early you can be right in front and height shouldn't be a problem.,1,149,30
As far as I know the sound check option (Floor GA $259.50) is just the P1 option but with sound check so I think you get in even earlier in the pit area. P1 GA would be standing w/o sound check ($198.50). I don't think there's anything more expensive than that unless you choose VIP option which includes the former.,1,316,60
"Thank you, I think I understand how the seats work now!",1,55,11
"""scary, scary!""",1,15,2
it's from the welcoming edition.,1,32,5
"Same. First time buying tickets for myself and a friend and because of the 4 pm sale time, I‚Äôll be at work and praying I have no meetings or interruptions. üò≠ ",1,158,31
Any older Blinks want to meet up earlier in the day for this? It'd be nice to meet people who actually live in the DFW area.,1,124,26
That‚Äôs the FX for you. Pretty consistent without costs at $1.30 CAD for every $1 USD. üòî,1,87,17
"So GA P1 is standing ($259.50) but without sound check ($329.50) right? Pardon my ignorance, I‚Äôm pretty new to concert stuff too. I‚Äôm not tall and my friend who‚Äôs accompanying me is not hardcore like me so I wished there were VIP privileges for seated tickets. üò≠ I think I‚Äôll go for the P1 seated. ",1,298,55
"Ah, I see. Appreciate the answer.",1,33,6
Honestly I think a lot of that will depend on the venue and city producer capability. We had bag size restrictions and bag checks plus metal detection (wand not doorway) but there were multiple stations per gender so there was virtually no queueing time.,1,254,44
People think she's mean!? I'm not really in the following scene but that's a surprise to hear.,1,94,17
me too. i‚Äôm still gonna watch this season but it won‚Äôt be as good without jennie,1,80,16
That is so awesome!,1,19,4
"Yes, Red/GA is standing, everything else is seated. Good luck!",1,62,10
"Cool. One more thing, how long did it take you to get into the venue aka how bad were the lines? I'm debating whether to get a seat or stand if the wait beforehand isn't too draining. ",1,184,37
"GA is standing only but you get to move closer to the girls, if you get in early.",1,81,18
"Yes, that should be right.",1,26,5
Set of Welcoming...,1,19,3
Wow the Hamilton tickets are so expensive. There is no middle like in the US. I mean I was ready to pay 150$ but not 200$. In US P2 is at least 150$ but in Canada P2 is like 200$ :( I guess I have to save up to afford the tickets I want hahaha,1,243,55
Huh! Huh! Huh! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!,1,32,6
Thank you so much for posting the maps! Question: so anything that's not GA (in red) has seats right? ,1,102,19
"I'm kind of new to this, but what is the difference between P1 GA and P1? I know it stands for general admission, but what does it exactly mean? Since Floor GA is the center area, and P1 is going to be seated (I assume). ",1,221,45
yes but i didn‚Äôt know if they had the same entry or earlier as the soundcheck GA or not since technically the vip package would be going in for the same thing,1,158,32
"Honestly, looking at all these breaks my heart T.T",1,50,9
now that the prices are out i‚Äôm trying to decide between the vip package and the soundcheck GA. the latter is $150 cheaper but if the vip package goes in BEFORE them then i consider it worth it.. plus the send off and laminate and whatever else,1,244,47
"we do have the prices pinned in our discord, they should be available on the website too now though!",1,100,19
"just updated the link, hopefully this works! :  ",1,48,8
"Hi, is the discord channel closed or set to private? Just tried to join and couldn't.",1,85,16
I have the same issue with you. Do you think reg GA will still be worth considering all the VIPs will take the good spots? ,1,123,25

They didn't post photos of their Hong Kong show. üòû,1,50,10

"Does anybody know what time the soundcheck usually starts? I‚Äôm so for it, but concert is on a Wed and I have work prior to the concert ",1,135,27
"Show looks expensive with the stage, lighting, live band, pyrotechnics, and extra dancers. It makes sense for BP to go all out as they've never done anything low key. They're having a comeback in March so the setlist will be bigger, should be a treat for US/EU concert goers.",1,275,49
"They usually do. I got tickets to Rise Against in Toronto ad their album came with the ticket. And in any case, I‚Äôm pretty sure (don‚Äôt remember the schedule) Hamilton is the only Canadian stop so I‚Äôd imagine that it is.",1,219,41
"I hope their upcoming comeback will be able to sell it out, in case they don't initially.",1,89,17
"I'll just copy-paste my comment from  [Seating maps](  if you need them. I saw them last night here in Singapore, they put on a very good show. Live band was rocking awesome and the stage effects/pyrotechnics were over the top. Must've cost a mint to produce, hence the teamup with Kia and obligatory F&amp;F Tokyo Drift-style VCR for the Kia Stinger in the middle of the show. Did they repeat songs? Yes, but only a reprise of DDDD at the encore. Setlist [here](  (no changes from the Manila show) Did they sing/rap live? Yes, pretty much. They used handheld mikes instead of the boom mouthpieces (except for Jennie's SOLO). Don't know if i have enough words/thoughts to warrant a concert report though, but feel free to ask if you want more feedback.",1,752,132

its about 400 dollars =(,1,24,5
Omg Jisoo singing clarity üòç,1,27,5
"Ya, to me, Ros√© is stable across all situation. Jennie is like two ends of the spectrum, so she could either be very confident and fierce or very shy and cute. Lisa just needs to feel more relaxed then she'll be perfectly fine. And Jisoo is fine with stuff in Korean but when it's English she gets shy/not confident.",1,316,59
"Ros√© usually is the more introverted group member which simply brings her less attention on a lot of occasions. But in general all the girls have their fair share of love i would say even if jennie and lisa seem to have a wider appeal in the west. So compared to other groups which have way more members Blackpink really stands out in its equal fan spread tbh, which is great and also something which will help in the west. With that being said, i was rather happy to see that Ros√© had her moments during these interviews on gma and strahan and sara and i am already excited for the us promotions during their tour (and her solo ofc)",1,633,120
I‚Äôm hoping to go!! I live in NY outside of buffalo!!,1,52,11
"Underrated? Really? I don‚Äôt mess around with fan groups for obvious reasons but when I watch the videos, she‚Äôs the one that always stands out imo.",1,146,26
I don't think being born in Korea was the problem. She was just visibly nervous and went blank at times. Her English is fine if you watch her other interviews.,1,159,30
&gt; It surprises me that Jennie isn‚Äôt really that great at expressing herself in english. But she does her best. She was nervous that's all being on US national TV. Watch her other English interviews [here](  [here](  and [here](  she does fine and is usually the point person for the interviews. I think everyone was shocked that Rosie was that confident and took so much control.,1,382,66
I LOVE that artwork of Jennie as princess Jasmine! Kuma looks extra cute in it too. Someone let me know if that person has an instagram or anything like that...would love to see more. ,1,184,34
"It has to do with YG not giving her solo promotions such as CF‚Äôs and variety shows on top of not having a viral moment like Lisa and Jennie have had. If YG plays their cards right during her solo, that would definitely be her time to shine ",1,240,48
"second this, her cheers for the singapore concert is the least but is okay. My forever bias ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",1,96,18
"ros√© is my forever bias. her voice is incredible and her personality is so adorable. ‚ù§Ô∏è and her dancing is underrated as well. i think her and jisoo are both underrated in a lot of ways. hopefully once they get their solos, theyll be able to shine and show off more of their talents.",1,283,54
So genuine,1,10,2
"Oh my god, I swear she gets even more beautiful every time I see a picture of her! ",1,83,18
its been awhile since she changed her hair color.. love it! &amp;#x200B;,1,72,12
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. ,1,23,4
Jisoo is even more underrated ;(,1,32,6
yo i am fucking dead right now.,1,31,7
"I just like to think that BLACKPINK is really well balanced in terms of how the group was brought together. Their teamwork really shows on-stage and off-stage. There's something for every fan out there when you're a fan of these four girls. It's sad that not everyone appreciates every member, but those of us who do get a little bit of everything from the four. ",1,363,65
"guys i want to clarify a few things because of what i‚Äôve seen people commenting. i‚Äôm sure a lot of you know this already, but for those who are doubting this website, its purpose, etc.. 1) the main reason why i posted this was for assurance to blinks that new blackpink music was coming soon 2) concert tours use this approach quite often in order to ‚Äòsell‚Äô more albums, as the price of the album will be worked into the ticket, and every purchase will go towards sales for charts, etc. it‚Äôs just a business tactic. 3) this isn‚Äôt to say there will be numerous choices for tickets for one show, or using one over the other. there will be ONE way of purchasing tickets for this show. either through ticketmaster or AXS, depending on the venue. 4) going off that, it is assumed this will be available for both services. whether or not there will be an option to include the album or not, i don‚Äôt know. if there is an option, there will be a choice to add it when selecting your ticket (think the ‚Äòcollectors ticket‚Äô option some shows have; it‚Äôs a $10 upcharge you can add) don‚Äôt freak out or question the authenticity of AXS. just go about your normal ticket purchasing ways and be happy we will be getting new music soon. :)",1,1222,228
Jisoo is just too much for me.,1,30,7
I think we have to keep in mind that Jennie was born in Korea‚Äîshe only studied English as a foreign exchange student. So it‚Äôs quite understandable for her to be nervous when speaking in English. ,1,195,35
"Yeah. Ros√© practically is the voice for the group outside of Korea apart from Thailand. She‚Äôs also quite the vocal queen, so why she didn‚Äôt get the first solo is ahead scratcher to me. It surprises me that Jennie isn‚Äôt really that great at expressing herself in english. But she does her best. lisa and jisoo are understandably similar to most idols when it comes to communicating outside korea. this past week seeing her talking really surprised me in a good way. ",1,465,82
Des Pa Cito,1,11,3
&gt;concert tours do this all the time. huh..TIL,1,48,8
"AXS is a legitimate ticket service used by several venues. just like ticketmaster, ticketfly, eventbrite, etc. its use it just dependent on the venue or tour. ",1,159,26
"Hmm I wouldn‚Äôt say underrated, but I guess she, along with Jisoo, are the lesser known members of the group internationally. However, she‚Äôs got some truly loyal fans out there + OT4 will always stand out during concerts. Always. No matter who your bias is, you will always cheer for OT4. Plus her solo‚Äôs coming after their Mar/Apr cb so I‚Äôm hoping she‚Äôll be more internationally recognized. Oh and of course the American + Europe tours I think she‚Äôll truly shine because she‚Äôs just *so* witty and nice and comfortable in interviews. ",1,533,92
She is the unsung hero of BLACKPINK. After watching her in the West is solidified it for me. They would NOT be able to function without her.,1,140,27
"concert tours do this all the time. it‚Äôs just a way of driving up sales. the cost of the album will already be worked into the price of the ticket. in my experience, there hasn‚Äôt been an option to choose with or without it, it either came with it or didn‚Äôt. idk how this will be. it‚Äôs nothing to freak out or worry over. i was just posting this as assurance new blackpink music was indeed coming.",1,396,77

I‚Äôve never thought about it from a preemptive induction of sympathy POV though so I found that rather interesting.

I don't know...maybe i'm just wierd, it sounds too good to be true what's the catch? &gt;.&lt; Actually now that i think about it, the people who attend the concert will probably buy the ep anyway so this might not make a huge difference anyways...honestly i don't know what i'm talking about, i'm tired.",1,418,76

"ticketmaster has usually pretty crazy fees but is obviously a reliable, well established service. it‚Äôs easy to get ahold of them and can solve problems fast plus the interface is just easier to navigate and seems to be able to handle lots of traffic at once. both the app and the website work well. i‚Äôve only used AXS a few times, and while in my experience, the fees weren‚Äôt as bad, but using the website was just not very user friendly. it‚Äôs slow and has a pretty shitty queue system that takes forever to get through. i‚Äôve used the app once and it was okay. you probably won‚Äôt have a choice when it comes to the venue you use. like for my show, fort worth, it‚Äôs through AXS. but i believe venues like the forum in LA use ticketmaster. if there is a presale, definitely take advantage of it because there‚Äôs been times i waited till general on sale for better tickets but either ended up with nothing or just very expensive tickets!",1,933,173
So cute,1,7,2
Wow ! That look,1,15,4
That's great!,1,13,2
in your opinion is it better to buy from axs or ticketmaster?,1,61,12
Basically... We should expect the EP late march/ early April? ,1,62,10

Does anyone know if there are VIP tickets for all NA concerts?,1,62,12
"they are just different ticketing services. and which one being used just depends on the venue. but i imagine this promotion will be available across every date no matter the service, since that‚Äôs usually the case when it comes to other tours.",1,243,42
yes sorry for not putting the source but this is it!! from the AXS website. üôÇ,1,77,16
OMG I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS ,1,29,6
Any difference between buying from AXS and Ticketmaster? ,1,57,8
Ya I‚Äôm suspicious! THIS IS SUSPICIOUS ,1,38,6
Not OP but I found the source!! [ ,1,34,8
It was. Not up on YouTube yet though,1,36,8
Was the Forever Young performance not broadcasted?,1,50,7
Wait this is real? Holy hell. ,1,30,6
It really does make me mad. Just because she puts on a powerful front doesn‚Äôt mean that she‚Äôs rude! We all know she‚Äôs a major softie. ü•∞,1,135,27
"Rose is so well spoken and relatable if that makes any sense. Jennie was definitely shy when she's put on the spot, but she had her ad lib and one sentence moments. She'll be more comfortable if they get more opportunities like these. She was great on the Colbert Pop Quiz. Lisa and Jisoo didn't get to speak much but they were so quirky with their body language. This was their first interview so I didn't expect them all to be in their comfort zone for their first interview. ",1,478,89
Jisoo and Lisa really didn't open their mouths outside of introducing themselves. Oh well.,1,90,14
Jisso and Lisa really didn't open their mouths outside of introducing themselves. Oh well.,1,90,14
He made a comment like the blinks were gonna grab a slice and I saw Jisoo eyeing that pizza.,1,92,19
"Yeah. I'm hoping is not just a ""Here's the DVD of the tour, buy the DVD"", and we actually get something like Blackpink House 2.0 I guess we'll find out eventually.",1,163,31
"They're like a John, Paul, George, and Ringo, albeit in a kind of aloof and condescending way in this video. She has the same kind of expression I'd imagine Cercei would have if she had to interact with the teeming masses. ",1,223,41
"While it is somewhat short, still a great interview. They presented themselves as very genuine and likeable, Ros√© carried as expected from the preview, joking with the hosts are just very confident. Lisa with her little dance move, getting ""strahan and sara"" involved and while jisoo didn't really say anything outside of the introduction her charisma was just so positive. Man i am looking forward to the next us interviews when they'll promote during their us tour, it will be great :)",1,487,82
Sorry this is kinda random but am I crazy or does [she look a lot like Nayeon here]( ,1,85,18
lol now I'm picturing her blurting that out lying on the ground,1,63,12
I‚Äôve never seen this shot before. If this this a new concept image I‚Äôm going to cry lol,1,87,18

Seeing her shine has been my favorite part of the whole US media tour for sure,1,78,16
I wanted to see them eat the pizza lol,1,38,9
"Oh Jisoo, did it hurt when you fell from heaven?",1,48,10
Too short for my taste but I‚Äôll take what I can get. I think Ros√© is really shining lately. She seems so confident and not nervous to talk at all. I‚Äôm loving this confident queen ,1,179,35
So sweet,1,8,2
they have been having a camera following them around on tour and in the US. so we should be getting something soon :),1,117,23
"Why can't we get Blackpink House 2.0? The first one was before DDDD, and so many things have happened, i think it's time for a second one.",1,138,27

"Good interview, a little short but the girls did well and came across as so genuine &lt;3 ",1,90,17
That human sized teddy bear is so lucky ,1,40,8
"I have no doubt that Blackpink is going to be the first girl group with a song reaching a billion views, maybe even kpop group in general. They're already the only ones with 3 videos w/ 500 million views. I still remember when Gee had the most amount of views for a Kpop girl group, and Bigbang had the most for boy groups, and now is Blackpink and BTS. I remember feeling so proud when they got to 300 million and now, 300 million sounds like something that can easily be achievable, when we know is not that easy, but Blinks somehow are so focused and dedicated that it truly seems like it. When i think of this era (DDDD) i honestly can say that there was Blackpink before DDDD and after. They have reached heights i didn't though was going to be possible right now, maybe something for a year or two down the line, but no, they really showed that they are this generations SNSD (in being the standard). We just need to get the physicals up, because their digitals are out of this world. They're their own brand. People use them as parameters of success. They really are THE girl group. Blackpink is TRULY the revolution, and i'm readyyyyyyyyy.",1,1147,212
"there was a seating map with the prices on it on the venue website for atlanta. floor was $269, lower level was $104, $154, and $204, and upper level was $79 and $104.",1,167,33
Is the lenses that she is using the ones that they advertise? She is def rocking them.,1,86,17
"I'm pretty sure that she's going to be the most followed soon. Jennie is going up as well, i think we may see both of them occupying the number one and two spots (i do think that lisa will continue to be number one, she seems to be more popular overseas). In any case, i would like to see all the girls in the first four spots, but that seems to be a tall order, but who knows. There's the comeback in March, and than Ros√© is going to have her solo. We may see a spike in their followers. Also, the tour is giving them an oportunity to showcase themselves a little more, and more people are checking them out... With how everything is going, and Coachella around the corner as well, they just may get there. ",1,708,138
I'm going to watch this every time I cry over anything. My heart just exploded &lt;33333,1,88,16

This usually happens when idols go on tours. As idols usually sings and dances especially those that are dance heavy they really burns alot of calories on stage. I hope the managers make sure they have enough rests and foods to last them the whole tour.,1,253,46
Does anybody know if ticket tiers/pricing will be posted in adv? Much easier to plan ahead with friends than making a last min decision once the tickets are on sale. Thanks! ,1,174,31
"Hey, just adding what I know from past experience. I can only speak for the Hamilton (Canada) location and im basing it on how the BTS tickets sold out. Price wise I would say you are looking at a $100-150 minimum and tickets will sell out in probably 10 minutes or less if in being honest. I assume less since Kpop has grown significantly since BTS came and blackpink has a pretty big following as well. Knowing there are multiple locations in the US perhaps it won't sell out as fast but I'd still aim to buy as soon as sale opens. ",1,534,102
I tried to get some for the berlin concert but like 20 min. later they were sold out. I didn't have any time right away so I didn't get a chance to see the prices.,1,163,35

"It seems like for BP, whenever there is a music performance video is uploaded, most likely on YouTube, the views, comments and then subscribe numbers skyrocketed, like ABC7 News uploaded their DDDD performance on GMA, Colbert's one, the Forever Young fancam on Strahan and Sara.... They are crazy....... most of the views are definitely from Blinks, and I really can't think of how it is even possible. Another so-called milestone is that the total stream count of BP songs on Spotify has now reached 1 billion times.

It would be disingenuous for them to change their sound so drastically just to fit in and I think it would backfire on them. For what it's worth, I am an Ariana Grande fan and I absolutely *hate* how she's changing her sound to be more hip-hop/trap oriented. And I am actually a huge, longtime fan of hip-hop, but it sounds so insincere and ridiculous coming from her. 7 Rings is pure garbage. The reason I started liking her was her powerful vocals and ballads. This whole ""yuh"" nonsense and her fake baddy attitude is making me dislike her. And I'm not the only one who thinks this, she's actually getting a lot of backlash for this. So, BP needs to stay true to themselves. Not everyone is going to be into their sound, but that's okay. They are doing just fine and have quite an impressive Western fanbase as it is. They don't need to change to suit everyone's tastes. The second I hear Lisa saying ""yuh"" is the moment I will start to lose interest.",1,1097,204

I didn't listen to much K-pop before (only a bit of Wonder Girls, SNSD and then PSY). But after listened to DDDD, I sort of changed my mind a little bit.

"look, all the links you posted either provided wrong or misleading information - and I already told you sometimes I just wished the media would stop mess up the terms ""ambassador"" and ""PR ambassador"". Look, it's a bit hard to explain - but to be THE Chanel ambassador, you are much more than simply endorsing/promoting Chanel product - you need to BE Chanel. It gets much more personal than being just the endorser. The ambassador is the face of the brand, meaning - not only cosmetics or costume line, but ALL Chanel products. And most importantly, you need to catch the eyes of Karl Lagerfield. Jennie is the ambassador and model for Chanel cosmetics line - not THE Chanel Ambassador. this one can give you a pretty accurate image of how Chanel choose their ambassador. |Never hasty to buy into any kind of partnership, Chanel carefully and steadily cultivates its ambassadors, year after year. Before signing Zhou Xun as the brand's ambassador for China in 2011, Chanel had been collaborating with the actress and singer for five years. Over this extended period of time, the brand was able to determine that Zhou Xun‚Äôs qualities and image were indeed consistent with Chanel's. And in order to make sure this would continue, as soon as the deal was sealed, Chanel started to effectively influence all aspects of her professional life, from public appearances to having a hand in choosing her outfits, make-up and hair styles.| [  Even Zhou Xun needed 5 years to officially become THE ambassador - the face of Chanel. GD has been seen wearing Chanel for years, but only officially became the ambassador in 2016. Jennie, on the other hand, has been announced as the face of the Cosmetics line, and she has been consistently promoting Chanel cosmetics products since then, but that doesn't make her the ambassador, not YET. It's still too early for her to become one. She hasn't appeared on Chanel Instagram nor website either - now tell me why the ambassador still hasn't make her appearance on the brand's SNS yet? &amp;#x200B; Jennie still has a long way to go, but she has to potential to become one. First? She will need to meet Karl. Let me tell you, the treatment between the face of Chanel and other ambassadors is really different. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;",1,2279,390

"I think you and the OP both have valid points. I don't like the idea of BP abruptly putting out a different sound, especially something they themselves may not be readily comfortable with, just to attract a particular audience. But it is a little worrying to think about how the general American audience might receive their current music because OP is right that in American music-timeline terms, their EDM sound is a little bit outdated and trap very much seems to be the 'meta' right now. Personally, I think their current music style will do fine because YGE's style for their groups is that indie, ""half asleep"" method of singing which resonates with Americans through similar sounding artists like Lana Del Rey, Halsey, Lorde, etc. I don't expect BP's music to dominate the charts and radio over here but at least their music is much more consume-able (for Western audiences) than say the super bubble gum pop sound of groups like Twice or Apink.

Didnt they arrive like an hour ago? Holy hell that must be tiring,1,65,13
"Oof, back to back flights?!",1,27,5
Disagree. They are perfect the way it is. The reason why BLACKPINK is able to this popular internationally IS because their (and YG in general)'s music is somewhat Americanized compared to other typical K-pop groups. It's the reason why they are able to enter the American market in the first place. They've got a perfect mix of Westernized + Korean sounds in their music.,1,372,64
"My perspective of it is that they don't need to conform to what's current. I agree that I'd love to see BLACKPINK evolve musically over time, but I don't agree with the sentiment that they need to do it to conform to Western standards. They're not releasing music to simply succeed in the Western market; I just don't believe that was their goal as BLACKPINK. They don't need to change what got them their in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I expect BLACKPINK to evolve musically over time but to do so in such an abrupt manner is unnatural and forced. You're simply ignoring your foundation and the audience that you've attracted. This is why I strongly support their double title track releases. It lets fans have the best of both worlds. ",1,746,134

"I think they‚Äôll continue with the style that they have and not change it to fit a mold. I was watching a YT video by some American music producers that have produce some successful Kpop songs and one of the questions was asked, why go to Korea? They said in Korea they are free to create unique sounds and music they have been wanting to do for while, but were unable to do in America, because here they are forced into certain sound. I like the idea of creative people being able to express the creativity without limits. Therefore, I hope BP and Teddy continue to make their own style of music. UMG signed them based on their current music, so they must think there is a space for it here. ",1,692,131

"I'm sure many companies are looking at them thinking that maybe they could have the next big thing, but i believe in timing. So many acts had to try and fail for it to finally happen. I don't think it's luck that we finally have groups like BTS or Blackpink being able to do more than what other groups were able to. They have the blueprint from the failure of other groups. They know what they need to do, or at least, they know what NOT to do, which is a valuable information to have. It helps the fact that it's a perfect storm of having more english speakers, including people who were actually born outside of Korea (in the case of Ros√©), and having a sound that is a lot more acceptable in the Western world, while still being something that Koreans find it cool and interesting. Striking the balance between being western friendly while still being something koreans would want to listen to often is incredible difficult and i'm sure one of the reasons why we don't have that many groups trying, or should i say, succeeding.

I mean, how can you have the talent that is Blackpink, and not have a plan of action of what you need to do or what is necessary to make sure they become as big as they can? Sometimes i feel like the girls are getting bigger despite YGE being the mess that it is. When you look at other girl groups of somewhat similar calibre (Twice, Red Velvet) and how much content they already have, it feels like a wasteland on this side. Thank God the girls are amazingly talented and have great personalities that make people want to wait for them. Any other group would have already been buried. They're so luck and don't even know it.",1,876,167

I'm hoping everything goes to plan. I want to see them everywhere. All the festivals, all the concerts, more countries, stadium tours... Let's hope it all goes the way we want, and soon Blackpink will be in everyone's area (or so WE hope). ",1,714,139

"Totally agree with you. That's probably why YG said BlackPink doesn't have the ""mental strength"" 2ne1 did. CL knows how to carry herself, but BP members are still trying to come into their own. Personally, I rarely watch interviews of artists I listen to, so their personality means almost nothing to me. I just want the music. I feel like BP can ride that kind of sentiment in at least part of the fandom. They just need to release more music.",1,444,81

"Jezebel is an old Gawker site, and as such can be safely ignored - especially the commentors. It's almost worthless.

You can see it it the comments on The Root all the time.

"then where does it say she is a Chanel Ambassador. Actually if you follow some other countries' showbiz, Cbiz for example, you will quite see the difference between the PR ambassador and Chanel ambassador. Before getting the ""Chanel ambassador"" title all the celebrities need a ""trial period"" when they will act as ""PR ambassador"" for Chanel, which means, to constantly post Chanel stuff on SNS, to wear Chanel in their daily life etc etc. This trial period can potentially last for years, and Jennie herself is pretty amazing already to get the PR ambassador title when she's still so young into her debut. She has never got the chance to meet personally with Karl Lagerfield before, had dinner with him etc. so def she is not a Chanel ambassador. GD is. Take Cbiz for example, while we have so many Chanel PR ambassadors, there is only one ambassador, Zhou Xun. Sometimes I just wish media will stop calling Jennie ""Chanel muse"", ""Chanel ambassador"" etc etc because it honestly ain't bringing any good for her... this is NO HATE, but anyone who knows about fashion world and ranking will knows Jennie is not the muse and the ambassador.

"She‚Äôs always known English and I would say semi-fluent, she‚Äôs just shy. People always assume she‚Äôs not because of her shyness but you have to remember as well when they first debuted she would never speak in Korean.

damnnn Rose looks SO good!!!,1,28,5
"congrats girls! üñ§üíñ even forgetting about the music side of it and just being totally about the money, american broadcasting companies would be incredibly dumb not to have blackpink &amp; other kpop groups on their shows more often. i was talking to my gf the other day about what a waste it was for bts to be at the grammys and not perform. i dont think american companies really understand how large these fanbases are.",1,420,75
"I speak 5 Asian languages fluently. Just wanna say... When we don't purposefully speak in a higher pitch, it just somehow switches on and it's kinda weird turning it off mid conversation. Lisa speaking in a deeper voice in the BP house or on VLive is relatable because she's close with the rest of the members. Me, my siblings and even my parents they'll speak in a higher tone when we talk to people we don't see often. But if we're talking amongst each other, we turn the high pitched voice off and use our ""home"" voice. Asians are weird",1,539,100
Perhaps this time the views come from more non-Blinks?,1,54,9
"I think this should dispel any assumptions that people have about her not being a fluent speaker. From the bits and pieces we've gotten over the years, her pronunciation and accent have been perfectly fine, she's just shy.",1,222,38

where did she get that info,1,27,6
"LOL Jennie was so nervous. When the host asked ""Why is the US ready for Blackpink"", her mic picked up her little ""oh my god..."". xD The host probably heard her and that's why she laughed. Rosie with the smooth save though. :')",1,226,43
They‚Äôre so adorable! üò≠üëå Lisa is such a cutie,1,44,9
"Lol they're all so cute! And Rosie and Lisa exposing each other. xD Lisa: I always have to call you. Rosie: You always eat fried chicken, fried chicken... Hope we get more environments where it's this relaxed. You can see how much more comfortable Lisa is here. ",1,262,47
Hands down the most English. It's almost like I'm watching a completely different person. I couldn't stop grinning the entire 3 minutes holy moly this video is pure gold for Western Blinks ü§©,1,190,33
"Considering that most musical acts at Colbert's barely reach 100K lifetime views, I think this is definitely a milestone for BP.",1,128,21
She is probably self conscious about it. Being in a native English speaking country she probably doesn‚Äôt want to make any mistakes.,1,131,22
"So Lisa obviously can handle english very well, she‚Äôs just not confident about it probably because Jennie and Ros√© are more advanced at it. She got the right words out and built sentences with no hesitation throughout the whole thing. ",1,235,40
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love me some Lisa Aegyo too. I guess what I am saying is I love all of Lisa üòÅ.",1,100,24
I really need this info. My sister is saying $300 for NOSEBLEED seats (Newark),1,78,14
"Back in 2016, I bet none of the members of BP thought they‚Äôd be doing a whirlwind promotional tour in the United States, much less being asked to perform at the Coachella. ",1,172,32
Lisa's english accent &lt;3,1,27,4
"I think she purposefully makes it higher in her korean speeches and korean variety, probably directives she got during training. Her korean voice is usually the deepest of the group in vlives and BP House",1,204,35
"Lisa‚Äôs voice is like honey üçØ. When Lisa speaks in English her voice is so much deeper, and it makes me feel some kind of way üòçüòµ. ",1,129,27
Is there anyone she doesn‚Äôt know??,1,34,6
I'm pretty confident this is the most English Lisa has spoken at one time on camera. Hopefully even more in the Strahan and Sara interview on Friday!,1,149,27
"I mean different places and circumstance and different girls can shine. That is the nice part about blackpink as well, they all have their own strengths. For these english interviews ros√© will be the one who is most comfortable, i don't think people forget that tbh, but that's part of what makes her shine here which is awesome to see. ",1,337,60
Yea a lot of people were saying Rose should be considered the group leader for her boldness in the interview but they forget that she's just comfortable in this Western setting but back home she's usually one to take the backseat in variety shows/interviews like you said.,1,272,47
This was so cuteee! Haha,1,24,5
Finally! I've been waiting for this!,1,36,6
That‚Äôs fair. It was just curious to me. Makes sense tho,1,55,11
"Ros√© is shining so hard in these and it makes me happy :D On korean variety she usually has the harder time, it makes perfect sense ofc, talking in your 2nd language is just different almost no matter how fluent you are. Anyway, great interview and a good start to the us promotions :)",1,285,54

"Technically no, since those sites promise delivery of the tickets by the event date, not immediately. Basically the person you are buying from hasn't bought them yet, but they are going to try to when they go on sale on Ticketmaster. That being said, don't trust those sites like your life depends on it if you can score them from Ticketmaster. You'll never know if they are going to work until you are at the door on the day of the concert. Not saying they can't be legitimate, but the only way to be sure is to buy them from the 1st party seller.",1,548,104
"This, exactly. It's not just that not everyone loved the performance -- although that's disappointing &amp; I wish everyone had loved BLACKPINK as much as we do -- it's how *mean* and nasty people were. The comments about their bodies and appearances, the comments so adamantly arguing they suck &amp; have no talent; I read one jerk say they're ""bad role models""! LOL Clearly that person knows nothing about them. I'm thankful I didn't read any racism comments because that's even worse :( It makes me ashamed to be an American reading comments like that. I want our girls to feel welcome &amp; respected here even more than I want everyone to be new blinks! But hopefully they won't read much of that garbage. Like another comment pointed out, they seem to be getting a lot of love on Instagram &amp; Twitter, so I hope they see the positive reactions :) and it sounds like they had fun with the hosts &amp; audiences at both shows! Hopefully that was all a positive, welcoming experience :)",1,993,175
I love the girls :),1,19,5
"This is my favorite comment &amp; it makes me feel so much better &lt;3 You'd think I would be prepped to expect nasty online comments by now, but somehow these girls are so awesome that I just assumed more people would immediately fall in love with them like I did last summer when I first learned about them. But you're so right -- anyone that out-of-touch &amp; cruel &amp; rude &amp; dismissive (all the people dissing K-pop based on one song while admitting they know nothing about it in the same sentence!) can suck it, indeed.

(Either way its gonna be awesome and i cant wait)",1,296,55
Without an interview and barely an introduction I feel like non-asian and/or non-kpop people are just gonna see this and go wtf. People in the other threads were talking about how colbert is better than GMA because the audience is younger. But in my eyes GMA went over way better and probably actually got americans interested in black pink. The camera work was better. There was blinks there. And the interview established that they can communicate with fans which is very important.,1,484,82

Anyone know of there are tickets that on sale before general public? Like amex does sometimes or certain fan clubs get early access.,1,132,23
They did so good ‚ù§Ô∏è,1,19,5
Omg I‚Äôm so proud of theeeeeem üò≠üíô,1,32,7
Rose looks GORGEOUS in that dress omg,1,37,7
That‚Äôs actually a perfect comparison. Haha,1,42,6
"Back in the day, it used to be ""live to tape."" ",1,47,11
Anyone know what price range will be? ,1,38,7
"When Jennie said ‚Äújust for fun‚Äù, her face actually turned into that of a 3 year old baby",1,88,18
"Oh you know just Rose speaking English on an American show. lol She really seems the most comfortable so far with interviews, I can't even imagine Jennie being nervous but looks like the girls are having fun and enjoying what's only the beginning of a great US tour. Also Strahan doing the body roll at the end was great.",1,321,59
"Oh, I see, makes more sense than selling tickets to be an audience member on a commercial TV show. Thanks for the info!",1,119,23
"with most US talk shows like this you have to apply for a ticket. think of it sort of as an open casting call. the tickets are free but you have to be selected, and for 1iota (the ticketing site for GMA, Stephen Colbert, James Corden etc) you have a higher chance of receiving tickets if you fill out your profile with demographic info!",1,336,64
"Wait... they were selling tickets to be in the audience of a TV show? Is that a regular thing on American TV shows, or was this a special occasion?",1,147,29

"Nope, no reason. At the time of posting, tickets weren't up for sale on Ticketmaster, only AXS.",1,95,17
"thank god, the conversion would've been even more deadly LOL",1,60,10
So we shouldn‚Äôt buy it from Ticketmaster? Is there a reason?,1,60,11
CAD same venue,1,14,3
general admission is just standing room only on the floor. so that‚Äôs why people line up early so they can be closer to the barricade. it seems with VIP though you get early entry onto the floor which just means you and whoever else purchased the package can access the floor before regular doors open. that way you can be in the front without having to wait in line to get in or get there early and stuff.,1,405,78
I‚Äôm a little confused. Ticketmaster and AXS says the sale is on Feb 20th but other sites like Stubhub or SeatGeek say you can buy tickets now. Are those scams or something? ,1,173,32

Count me in for Atlanta! I'll probably fly in for the weekend so if anyone is down to grab a hotel together or knows of a good place to stay hmu (I'm 19/M),1,155,33
"Yeah, at the end of the day people are going to like what they like and I get that. I'm comfortable with the fact that for a large portion of the USA, BP/kpop just will never be their cup of tea. The comments I had a problem with were things like ""Go back where they came from"", ""they look like prostitutes"", and others attacking their appearance and nationality - and those mainly came from the Baby Boomer+ crowd. But, that's Facebook for you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è which is why young folks are fleeing it in droves. Luckily, Twitter and IG are significantly more relevant in terms of social media presence, and the reactions on those platforms were overwhelmingly positive. And at the end of the day, money talks - as long as the interest in BP continues to generate money, social media hits, viewership, viral songs/videos/posts, etc, I don't think the big shots in Hollywood care if any portion of the nation doesn't ever like them. I think if they have a really strong, well planned comeback, especially if they collab with a big Western artist at some point, some more people will come around to them üòä We just need to be patient and keep our expectations realistic. And of course, we blinks must continue to be supportive by tuning in, liking, sharing, listening, and spreading positivity about them. ",1,1291,228
The face of that cardboard cutout scared many QBs back in his NFL days. He was like a sack master! Haha!,1,104,21

I sometimes forget that Strahan is an NFL Hall of Famer was a feared defensive opponent on the field. He‚Äôs like a gentle giant now. Haha!,1,137,26

That‚Äôs right!,1,13,2
I may juss be SuperFanning right now but I coulda sworn BLACKPINK was in New York prior to this performance bcuz I distinctly remember them being in Williamsburg?? I would know cuz I was living in Bushwick at the time which isn‚Äôt far at all. Weren‚Äôt they here for a fashion show??? ,1,282,52
"I don't think most people believe she's fluent, but she clearly knows enough to take part in an english interview. In the Strahan interview when she answered a question she practically whispered it so I think it's clearly just nerves. There are all kinds of clips on twitter from after the Strahan show of her speaking to the hosts and staff in english just fine. I'm guessing she's nervous and not confident in her english even though it is sufficient",1,452,80
"Jisoo is like, why am I still here just to suffer!!! Lol",1,56,12
It‚Äôs possible. Was just curious ,1,32,5
"Idk if it‚Äôs allowed to say here but Ros√© has to start eating. She looks borderline anorexic! I know idols have to be skinny, but this seems too far. But maybe I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about.",1,195,38
I think they didn't know that YG already told us about the album. Maybe they didn't hear the news,1,97,19
Sounds fair.,1,12,2
&gt; Dude ~~hit~~ smacked them all with a kiss,1,46,9
Agree to disagree? ,1,19,3
"No I wouldn't consider her native either. My mention of native speakers was a compliment of Rose saying even native speakers can't speak confidently like that in that type of situation. I know this isn't a fair comparison (although if you want to be a superstar then maybe it is fair and excuses aren't good enough) but if you look at CL in interviews she just oozes charisma and confidence. She is also not a native speaker. But all that aside, if you want to make it big in America you HAVE to have the confidence that you are a star. If you don't then stand next to Lisa and Jisoo and let Rose do the talking. We're making excuses because we're fans but let's be honest, we're not the market for interviews like this. ",1,721,135
"Well the only thing I could find about VIP for the tour was in Manila, referring to Send Off (stand behind barriers and they walk out of the concert and say hi to fans, kind of like red carpet) and Soundcheck (not sure, sounds like you get to see the warm-up?). That sounds like it's different than whatever the other guy was referring to in the other thread, as it was cheaper too.",1,382,73
I'm guilty of having repeated that clip over 20x in one sitting previously just for her cute little Thai accent lol. But she's 100% reading off of lines in that. ,1,162,30
"  I found it! Aside from a little hesitancy, I think this is absolutely fine. ",1,78,14
"I'm pretty sure it's just nerves. I heard an interview on an Instagram thing the other day, but it was just audio and she was talking about making the songs or something? I don't even know what it was, but she was absolutely fine. When she's around Jennie and Ros√© she seems to start doubting herself, and asks them if she's saying the right thing. I should also point out here that I'm not a crazy ass Lisa stan trying to defend her (my ultimate bias is Jennie üòç) but I do think I've heard her speak enough on various videos that she could easily get by in English if she would stop being so doubtful. ",1,603,116
Stephen Colbert,1,15,2
It's worth noting that Jennie really knows how to work a Korean audience. It's not surprising that she's the most popular variety show guest among the BP members. She knows what to do with Korean hosts and how to respond to jokes in her own witty way. Rose however isn't as comfortable in those situations. I think that just shows that Jennie is just more comfortable interacting in Korean while Rose is more familiar doing things in English.,1,442,78
"With her proportions, she can wear anything and it will genuinely look good. ",1,77,13
You know it!!! ,1,15,3
How do the standing work? I've never understood difference between general. Admission and premium,1,97,14
"I've literally watched all of those interviews üòÖ and at most she'll say a sentence or two and then let Rose or Jennie take over explaining. Like I said, her pronunciation is near flawless so people mistake her for being fluent but she's just not quite there yet. ",1,263,48
What does vip do?,1,17,4
"4.5 hour drive to Toronto, here I come!!!!!!",1,44,8
I called twice and the first time I got no answer after waiting 30 minutes. Second time around I got an answer but no information regarding ticket prices ,1,154,28
"No, she's not as fluent as she's gotten in Korean, but there are interviews out there where she speaks English absolutely fine. It's definitely 85% shyness. ",1,157,26
&gt;Dude hit them all You watch your words there fella grrr ,1,60,11
"I wouldn't consider Jennie a ""native"" English speaker. She grew up in Korea in her early years and had to learn English later. That is a HUGE disadvantage when it comes to speaking in front of an audience when you have to rely on ""muscle memory"" while forming sentences in a confident way that you know the audience expects. I've done a fair share of speaking in front of large audiences. And although I grew up in the U.S. speaking English, it's not easy projecting fluency and thoughtfulness on the spot like that. I've heard Jennie speak a lot in interviews and I always noticed she doesn't have the mastery of the English language that someone growing up in the US/Aus/UK would. ",1,683,122
"I'm looking forward to the proper footage, on all these videos the girls are fully drowned out by the fans ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1,112,21
"They definitely are, I think we just aren't used to seeing them in a western setting ",1,85,16
"Feel so bad for Jennie, she was trying so hard to take some of the interview burden off of Rose but she was just too nervous to really say anything substantial. Rose though, oh my goodness... carrying this segment by being able to not only answer questions well but managed to joke around and flow with the conversations. So proud of her. To be expected of our Aussie native though. Also poor Jisoo T.T it's ok jisoo we all understand your position lol. ",1,454,83
There isnt a lot of stuff Jisoo cant pull off ,1,46,10
"u/HumpingJack, your comments are always full of positivity and optimism!üëç",1,73,10
Also going to Newark. Trying to link up with some blinks ( also not your typical Kpop fan at all lol),1,101,21
"Heh, I'm a ""slightly"" older American that loves BP. I think people just like what they're used to, just like anywhere else. There are way too many musical genres in the US to count. And trust me, different people groups here hate on different musical genres all the time. We Americans are completely spoiled when it comes to music because there is soooo much music produced and released here, and so people feel entitled to hate on music that doesn't fit their tastes. It sounds stupid, but that's just what happens. I don't know that the Coachella audience will be all that open-minded. Even the young people tend to be pretty cynical when it comes to the type of music they like. Unless BP's set is filled with Blinks, I'm not so sure they'll get a positive response. I'm just hoping that it'll be filled with drunk people who are looking for a fun time. AND blinks too. That's the best case scenario :) &amp;#x200B;",1,918,165
Hmm I'm not so sure. Jennie speaks English all the time. Rosie was exuding confidence that most native speakers wouldn't have in that situation. I know it's a super short interview but Rosie came off as a star and Jennie as a shy teenager caught on camera for the first time. I'm not trying to hate on Jennie fwiw. I'm just saying it as I see it.,1,346,67
"Yes, they did perform, this is the link:  ",1,42,8
Hell yes it's weird! That's why we're gonna do it right? Seriously it's not weird. I'm getting two lightsticks.,1,111,19
they killed it! ,1,16,3
I‚Äôm in the same boat. Maybe I‚Äôll see you there. Lol. ,1,53,11
"Lisa is definitely not as fluent as everyone thinks she is. The few times she does speak, her pronunciation is very on point so all the Blinks think she's a practically flawless English speaker, just shy, but it's pretty evident she doesn't have nearly as firm a grasp on English as she does Korea. Lisa didn't attend an international school, like Sorn of CLC who is truly fluent and confident in English, so her exposure to English was most likely from American media and her Swiss stepfather. ",1,495,87
Yeah I just wanna make sure. Like my friends already make fun of me for liking Kpop so getting a lightsick I guess is the least of my worries lol,1,145,30
LOL I fucking love Colbert. ,1,28,5
"I guarantee you it's not the audience they're nervous about, it's the English interactions. Rose is confident as she was born and raised in Aus/NZ but Jennie only studied in NZ for a couple of years. And factor in the fact that these girls have been in South Korea for the past 6-7 years with barely the chance to really practice their English. ",1,345,63
I love this. I just don‚Äôt wanna be outta place ya know,1,54,12
Just like you mate. I bought the big lightstick as well as the little keychain one. It‚Äôs definitely NOT made for 24 year old straight guys but I‚Äôm still gonna represent for the girls and wave it around during their concert ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. ,1,229,42
It‚Äôs not weird at all! If anyone makes fun of you bop them on the head with it.,1,79,18
Yeah I was worried about that. However I think the rap parts helped because you could clearly hear the power in their voices during the raps.,1,141,26
Man I‚Äôm with you. They look scary skinny. Unhealthy skinny. ,1,60,10
lmfaooooo some of their jokes are more r-rated than graham nortons,1,66,11
It looks like VIP section is not in the GA standing area. Do you guys think VIP will be standing or sitting? ,1,109,22
"I see, thank you all! I am getting to know what Americans think about K-pop or even music now!",1,94,19
"Jennie is naturally skinny and Lisa looks muscular in a good way. I am a little worried about Rose and Jisoo but still. Some people are just naturally skinny. I‚Äôm as skinny as them and I eat way too much, just work out 3 times a week to offset it. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. If anyone has before/after photos then I could see if they‚Äôve had drastic weight loss.",1,351,68
I was in that section for BTS and the tickets were around 250 after fees and tax. ,1,82,17
"Yep, fashion is cyclical and apparently skinny jeans aren't ""in"" anymore but baggy, wide pants are lol. ",1,104,17
Yess finally Rosie posie's time to shine. They looked so comfortable in this interview. I hope Jisoo don't feel so alone there.,1,127,22
Thank you sm!!,1,14,3
how we tho? Someone should make a gc or something ,1,50,10
"they usually give her street style clothes, which currently is going through a 90‚Äôs revival! ",1,93,15
"Yes, see [this]( ",1,17,3
"I might get tickets for Atlanta and stop by on my way to Florida. I've never heard good things about Prudential Center so.. unless they add a DC show, or even a Virginia show, Atlanta is my choice so far.",1,204,40
I love watching the Graham Norton show very much! Yet I doubt that BP could quickly and beautifully respond to Graham Norton's questions lol. But still getting onto the Graham Norton show would be absolutely great.,1,214,36
so is Lisa,1,10,3
I have lived to see Lisa [body roll](  on US TV. Now I have something to tell my children.,1,90,19
"I don't think so. And it's decent pricing for K-POP concerts. IIRC, K-CON and Big Bang were similar in pricing.",1,111,20
"I love BP, but these comments were pretty much expected. US is extremely diverse in terms of musical tastes, and BP is never going to be able to scoop up the vast majority of them. YG's strategy is to simply target the ones that have an affinity towards KPop. And there are plenty that will tune in, given the population of Asians and young people here. However, I do worry a little bit for them, and I hope the hate/racism BP inevitably gets on the boards don't reach them or phase them in any way. ",1,500,95
Hmm maybe they took it down. [Here's a screenshot](  I took last night.,1,71,13
I‚Äôm confused. Are they not allowed to talk about the album coming out end of March time. I guess it‚Äôs to protect YG if they can‚Äôt deliver by then,1,145,29
That‚Äôs our Jichu,1,16,3
"Gosh I love their outfits. Jisoos dress is so cute and unique. Jennie's outfit is stylish and very gossip girl. Ros√©s outfit is very Ros√©! Mini dresses are so cute, I love them and she pulls them off so well. Lisa's outfit is my favorite. I actually like the baggy pants. Maybe it's because her outfit looks like something I normally wear (high waisted baggy pants and a crop top). Anyway, I love their outfits and would wear every thing the girls are wearing in this picture. ",1,477,87
"Man , they looked great but the lip sync was terrible",1,53,11
Live south of ATL but I'm coming up! Would love to be a part of festivities. ,1,77,16
I saw someone mentioning that Black VIP in Europe was ¬£543. Pink was like ¬£270 or something though which wasn't that bad.,1,121,22
Idk if I have bad depth perception but I seriously thought that guy at the beginning with the giant clear box was about to drop that right over Jennie and sweep her away lol,1,173,34
"American's aren't used to seeing artists perform with loud backtracks, especially if you're watching them perform live. I think that's going to be the biggest hurdle for KPop artists coming over. They'll be purely judged by vocal talent alone, especially with shows like The Voice being as popular as they are. At least, that's my take. Anyways, BP isn't going to please everyone. The important thing is the haters don't drown out the real fans out there. ",1,456,77
"It‚Äôs not cute. If that‚Äôs high fashion, no.",1,42,8
BP would have to channel their **Black** side on the show.,1,58,11
Where did Yu get this information about VIP? Is it here on subreddit? ,1,70,13
I think it was also partially because of the volume of the Blinks. So far there's no official video of Forever Young (as far as I can tell they did it for the later show with the interview) but the fan videos of it are almost inaudible because of the fans. I reckon the backing track is cranked up to drown out the fans. ,1,321,64
OMG JENNIE WAS SO NERVOUS I JUST WANT TO HUG HER,1,48,11
"Yaaaay, it was already fun watching the preview and there's a longer version coming... My heart üòç Plus it looks like they recorded Forever Young for the later show? ",1,165,29
"Ouch, I'm not sure how much the general American audience is going to like Kpop after watching this. They have a hard time with performers who sing overtop the vocals of their own songs (and sometimes lip sync). Just look at Ashlee Simpson.",1,240,43
"No way! Dude hit them all. I only don't see Rose getting any love, but only because that was pre-video recording. You can see in the first second he is pulling away from Lisa and then off screen does like two moves with Jisoo. I don't want to get all technical because now I feel like a creep. He did it presumably to all of them.",1,330,66
"It's probably because Blackpink is still ""new"". When I say new I mean new to people in the US who don't listen to kpop. Give it time, Blackpink will rise in popularity and maybe next time we'll get a longer interview.",1,217,41
"To be honest, I was disappointed at how loud the backing track was on GMA. I could still hear their voices, but just barely. One of the reasons I enjoyed the Colbert performance was because the backing track was low so their voices really stood out - and they sounded GREAT! So I don't understand why they cranked the backing track up so loudly for GMA. I guess just because it was a live performance vs Colbert was pretaped, but still. ",1,437,81
"BTS went on there. But I see what you mean, doesn't necessarily have to be r-rated. Maybe on ""This Morning"" then with Holly and Phillip? ",1,137,25
"I watch the preview for the Strahan and Sara show, if someone can post it. Lisa finally speaks and her first word is HOTDOG. Lol.",1,129,25
It's on jam fm for month now. Only reason I sometimes listen to the radio xP,1,76,16
He only kissed Jennie :) ,1,25,5
What are they? I couldn‚Äôt find anything lol,1,43,8
Graham Norton seems a little too r-rated for them though. Not sure YG would want to associate them with that image just yet.,1,124,23
"Bts had been to unicef, and performed at the bbmas. There was a lot on their radar compared to a simple US tour.",1,112,23
Hopefully they get onto The Graham Norton show when they come to the UK. ,1,73,14
This is hilarious lmao!,1,23,4
"Not to raise an issue, but aren't Jennie and Rose pretty westernized?",1,69,12

"UK top range VIP was ¬£417, so whether or not they'll be roughly the same or reflect the currency difference is debatable... The other rough ticket prices do look pretty similar though.

Lisa finally said something. This looks like it will be a fun interview.,1,72,13
"They weren't lipsyncing, you could clearly hear their voices over the backing track. I don't think people are really used to backing tracks being used that way though, particularly in kpop they keep the vocals fairly loud so that if the girls want to stop for a breath or something, the song will keep going. But they were still really audible over the top. ",1,358,64
It's also posted on the show's [YouTube]( ,1,42,7

"The target demographic for Good Morning America is old retired folks who are out of touch. That generation in America is very narrow minded. For that reason, GMA probably was not the best platform for a kpop group trying to make a first impression in the US. Some of the comments are disgusting and rude, but not unexpected given the average GMA viewer (notice the negative comments are mostly old people!) Coachella on the other hand is targeted towards a younger, more hip, more open minded crowd - I'm certain BP's reception at Coachella will be much more positive!",1,568,99

"Ugh, I wish I hadn't looked. Some of those comments are downright cruel. üòû But all the negative comments are from super old people who are out of touch anyway, so it doesn't concern me too much.

I thought they had a backup track and sang with it? Also I know that body standards r diff in every country, but why is everyone bodyshaming them? Like is not America always talking about body positivity and how every type and size of body is beautiful? I get that they thought BP was being starved to death, but is not it rude to make assumptions without an actual proof? Damn now I dont know what to expect from Coachella",1,607,114

It definitely seems like Rose and Jisoo dropped like 10 pounds between BlackPink House and Square Up promotions. I think they both look a little too thin but Jennie and Lisa look okay. I just hope it's their choice to be that thin and not being pushed by YG. ,1,259,49
Ms Chichu and a little black dress r the ICONIC DUO im telling yall,1,67,14
Life‚Äôs good he wen‚Äôt from being the all-time in single season sacks to spending time with blackpink which is a pretty good way to go,1,132,25
These four cutie pies r soooo adorable ughhh &amp;#x200B;,1,57,9
They‚Äôre so cute! You can tell everyone was enamored üñ§üíñ,1,54,10
really ? from the general public or from the kpop community or blinks?,1,70,13
"I'm sorry, Chichoo! I had to ask.",1,33,7
"I really really don't want to drive to ATL because it's awful... but I guess I'll just suffer through it for the pay off. I really wish they were doing this tour during the summer. Doing it around the time of finals is kind of bad planning on the organizers' parts. Also, they aren't doing any of these tours near enough communities of Asian-Americans. They should have at least 2 concerts in California. ",1,405,73
Thank you! This is what I was thinking/fearing.,1,47,8
There are lots of mixed reviews on Facebook. I really hope they could do good eventually!,1,89,16
"Anyone can gain/lose weight. It's just difficult because the amount of food we think we need to add/subtract is way less than the actual effective figures. So when we try to eat more or less, there's little to no change. What is really needed to kick the change off is exaggerated additions/subtractions to food intake.",1,319,55
"Yep! Weight management is really just simple math. You gain weight if you get more calories than you lose, and lose if it's the opposite.",1,137,25
I love how they blended so well with the western and their customs.,1,67,13
"Yea the problem is they're doing it on a weekday in TX and I'm taking my teen, so I prefer she loses only one school day instead of two :( Never been to Atlanta before so that should be quite the experience lol. Do you live there? I'd appreciate any recommendations!",1,266,51
"I watched it. They were so good, as always. What legends.",1,57,11
I cant wait! They are going to be so close to me in Chicago! Got my light stick ready üòä,1,87,20
If you‚Äôre in Mexico wouldn‚Äôt it be more ideal for you to go to the one in Texas then? ü§î unless you juss rather the arena in ATL for your preference. Either way I‚Äôm down! ,1,170,35
"Let‚Äôs be real here, nobody is gonna agree with you haha. But it‚Äôs definitely true they are forced to be skinny/slim it‚Äôs the reality there no denying. I know this is a different company, but Wendy from red velvet??? During red flavor days she was SO skinny and her face got so skinny it was extremely obvious. It was almost dangerously skinny. People were outraged like why are they starving her. They can tell from rookie to red flavor something happened. And during peekaboo and bad boy she gained weight and looked great. Her face didn‚Äôt look like she had the life sucked out of it. There was literally a video of Wendy eating ice cream and her manager was looking at her (off camera) kinda telling her she should be eating that, and the girl from girls generation said to the manager ‚Äúlet her eat!‚Äù ??? Don‚Äôt tell me these companies have ethics and value people over money. They do what gets them money. Sure jisoo and Jennie look a little thicc compared to Lisa and rose but I don‚Äôt why. Everything is done to these girls from hair, clothing, body size,things they say, etc for a REASON. It‚Äôs not like they go around telling us. Because that would make them seem like the enemy! Sure on blackpink house they showed rose eating left and right. But they could‚Äôve wanted you to see that she eats so nobody would make all these accusations that they starve her or make her diet 24/7. Again there is a reason for everything! I love these girls and their personality and they‚Äôre BEAUTIFUL üëè but don‚Äôt go around saying they have the choice to do this and that. ",1,1559,285
Even the host - Stephen like Ellen just go along the ride for extra ads money and aren‚Äôt too enthusiastic about Korean group. ,1,126,23
How so?,1,7,2
I'm in Mexico and want to go (depends if I can get tickets ofc) I just hope it doesn't sell out too quickly!! If it's a fairly big venue I guess it should be ok do you think? I agree on the group!,1,196,43
This pic is how I feel about this post it's perfect,1,51,11
I think I remember that one hahaha. They do have big appetites.,1,63,12
Will do,1,7,2
"I think Jennie in general is shy, but her performance is always the opposite, it's kind of a nice surprise. I'd like to hear from Lisa and Jisoo, but I know they're still learning. It's too much pressure to talk on national television, so I hope they don't get pressured to do so. ",1,281,53
"Fast metabolism is a myth. They simply eat enough calories to sustain themselves, they don‚Äôt overeat. ",1,102,16
"Indeed. They haven't been sick ever, I think, which is good. ",1,61,11
"Probably just nervous, we‚Äôd also been standing out in the cold + eventually snow for like 3-4 hours at that point üòÇ ",1,116,22
"Dude, I'm here waiting for season 2. Yes, I know they have big appetites. I'm just just suggesting that maybe it isn't to hard to imagine the look-conscious management to still be putting them on restrictive diets. If that's not the case, then I'm glad! Maybe I should've been more specific. I'm more concerned with Lisa and Rose. ",1,331,58
I love how Lisa's fashion always seems like it's straight from the year 2001,1,76,14
"I'm just so overwhelmed haha. So many emotions at once. I'm so proud of them, they've done so well this trip. Gah nervous Jen Jen, someone give her a hug. American blinks made them feel welcomed, that's what I was hoping for. ",1,226,42
The girls were asked on one of the idol shows if they dieted before a comeback and the said yes. When asked how many meals a day they were down to they said 3... With snacks.,1,174,36
"Yes Jisoo does look to be in a healthy weight. It could be that they're all naturally thin, in which case that's good. As long as they're eating fine, and when I say this I mean they're not being put on crazy diets, then all is well.",1,233,47
keep telling yourself your opinion is valid ,1,44,7
? Having a valid opinion and question is wrong? Wanting to discuss something that may be important is wrong? ,1,109,19
Thanks! I'm not counting out the fact that Lisa's always been thin. That makes sense.,1,85,15
"But can I say how happy I am for BP. This exposure, experience, and just how awesome they are doing!",1,100,20
"Thanks for this! Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on skinny people. I'm not telling anyone to do anything with their bodies except to strive to achieve the healthiest they can be. ",1,182,33
I just hope whatever they are eating has the proper nutrition they need to perform and stay healthy. Once the north American and Euro part of the tour kicks off they got work to do.,1,181,35
"I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being naturally skinny, if that's how your body really is. I'm not saying they're not beautiful. That's exactly why I wanted to discuss this, to see what people think about the situation, to share their opinions.",1,255,43
They split the interview up. They have another one for 'Sara &amp; Strahan' which is the afternoon hour of GMA. ,1,112,20
Do you even Black Pink House?.. The girls are quite short in height but they still look proportionate. How can you think Jennie needs to eat more when she‚Äôs got the most marshmallow cheeks. Have you seen Jisoo‚Äôs legs lately they‚Äôre thicc/er. ,1,242,42
Exactly this! I think she looks great,1,37,7
"They performed on the second floor so we could only watch from the big screen outside of GMA. And yeah, everyone who had a ‚Äúgeneral admission‚Äù ticket was turned away except for those few people who were lucky enough to do the quiz segment. ",1,240,44
They'll get better over time with more interviews. Their nervousness makes them look genuine and endearing. ,1,108,16
We can care about multiple things? LMAO,1,39,7
Couldn't you see through the window? So you're sayin u got a ticket but wasn't allowed in? ,1,91,17
"It was so surreal seeing them on my tv instead of my computer or phone screen lol. I'm glad they are getting world recognition, I just worry that the American demographic will be too critical of them tbh. Still, I'm so happy they're out of the dungeon! ",1,253,47
THIS IS NOT A NORTH AMERICAN TOUR IT IS A US TOUR.,1,50,12
Good catch. I'm usually watching Rose so I didn't even catch it. I'm glad she didn't. She would've been super embarrassed. The fans wouldn't have made a big deal about it though :-),1,181,33
"Lisa used to have more meat on her when they debuted but Ros√® has always been very skinny. I do wish they would both gain a few pounds, mainly because it looks like you can do doubleshots out of their collarbones if they were laying down. I honestly think Jisoo and Jennie are perfect. Jisoo is my thic Queen.",1,309,59
"Yes, this Friday, 15th.",1,23,4
"I‚Äôm happy for the girls and they did great today!! It was also fun to meet Blinks at the event. I was pretty disappointed by how the ticketing was handled though. Only people with priority tickets got in, the people who were chosen for the quiz were at the front of the GA line. They let about 20 of us do the shot where you see Blackpink ‚Äúarriving‚Äù at the pink carpet so it was really cool to see them up close for a few minutes but I still wish I‚Äôd been able to see them perform. They oversold by probably about 50 tickets so a lot of people stood out in the cold for nothing, some didn‚Äôt even get to go into the pink carpet thing.",1,633,127
Hopefully they were not to embarrassed by the hugging. You know what Koreans are like for manner hands.,1,103,18
"They were visibly nervous, but still a great North American debut for them between this and The Late Show. I am so hyped to see them in concert!",1,144,28
"You‚Äôre getting down voted but you‚Äôre probably right. Most of his audience are older, and probably aren‚Äôt interested in Black Pink no matter how well they perform. ",1,163,27
You already lose the race because you're gonna be online the SECOND it goes on sale. Need to be there the millisecond it goes on sale ;) ,1,137,27
DAMN JENNIE,1,11,2
"Do they not eat normally? Do we know how or what they eat? We don't exactly. We only have assumptions. So far, Lisa and Rose do not look unhealthy to me despite being skinny. Jenny is thick and sexy, Jisoo looks fine.",1,217,42
Then they come to the Netherlands and its so expensive. ,1,56,10
Y‚Äôall downvoting this comment when they have a point and aren‚Äôt even attacking anyone. Everyone else went for a more feminine vibe while Lisa went for a more girl crush; which is fine but the colors throw it off in terms of group harmony. ,1,239,44
"I agree. She pulls the outfit off amazingly, buy she also looks like she might just be a backup dancer. They should have at least matched colors. I understand they were going for that hip hop feel",1,196,37
whats wrong with you,1,20,4
can‚Äôt sit there,1,15,3
As a person who has been as thin as they are my whole life I can guarantee you they eat lol They just have very fast metabolisms on top of the fact that they‚Äôre constantly performing/practicing which makes them burn more calories. ,1,231,42
They only performed DDDD,1,24,4
It probably has to do with YG limiting the questions they can ask the girls and wanting the ‚Äúinterview‚Äù to stay on the topic of their tour,1,138,27
My wife is as skinny as Lisa and eats constantly. Some people are like that. ,1,77,15
You could‚Äôve gotten your point across without coming across as inflammatory statement. What you said is highly subjective. Let‚Äôs just leave it at that. ,1,152,24
"Thanks to Blackpink that Blinks watch the whole news and even learn about storms coming to NY, a truck accident etc.",1,116,21
I really hope they do the girls justice with a nice interview for their Friday show which is probably taping today I'd imagine. ,1,128,23
"Jisoo almost tripped at the 3:04 mark, fortunately she was able to keep her balance",1,83,15
she had her mind right set on that stage lol such a cutie pie,1,61,14
That quiz for the Golden ticket tho... were they really Blinks or just super nervous? People sometimes have their mind go blank under pressure. Haha. Feel kind of bad for them. ,1,177,31
i wanted to hear Lisoo at least say a single world but oh welp Jennie and Rosie's exotic accents and cute and nervous laughs make up for itÔªø,1,140,28
She had to avoid getting crushed beneath those balloons!,1,56,9
Poor Jennie lol she's like internally in panic mode xD,1,54,10
Well it's been a political talk show for the past three years so at this point I think it's pretty set in stone. ,1,113,23
Now this was a little unfair. When bts goes on they have a 5+minute sit down interview. And bts only has ONE English speaker. I am a fan of gma and most of the performers interviews are longer than 5 minutes. ,1,209,41
"Yes, she was too nervous, I think she forgot to mention some important details about the tour lol",1,97,18
Newark for me as well.,1,22,5
I don't know if I'm even in my right mind or not but the dude looks like a cardboard cutout...,1,94,20
We get an awesome performance and all you guys seem to care about is how you don't like Lisa's outfit? SMH,1,106,21
No but. I neeeeeed to know.,1,27,6
Performance [link]( ,1,20,2
"I don't think it looks bad or anything, she looks great, but the colours and theme don't fit the other 3 outfits. Honestly, for outsiders it might look like she isn't even in the same group x:",1,192,37
"Yes, it was live, GMA just uploaded the interview on YouTube [ ",1,63,12
It was all live yes,1,19,5
Is it live?,1,11,3
Thank god she didn‚Äôt say Rojay lmao,1,35,7
The interview is too short for me... and they can't even sit down to take this interview,1,88,17
What is the grey? ,1,18,4
Jennie super nervous lol. Rosie so used to speaking for the group she's always composed.,1,88,15
The interview session is way too short.....,1,43,7
am i the only one who actually likes lisa's outfit? It makes her stand out so much and highlights her tomboyish style ,1,118,22
I'm planning on going but it all depends on my exam schedule and transit :(,1,75,15
unfortunatelly they always do that,1,34,5
They are slaying again,1,22,4
Doesn't matter what you look like. Black Pink is the revolution,1,63,11
"If I've learned one thing this week... on other social media platforms, I have zero kpop and jpop friends. ",1,107,19
"BTS played the same arena, maybe ACC is full and/or they're still feeling out the market by going ""smaller"" with Hamilton.",1,122,21
Lisa‚Äôs outfit is so out of place compared to the rest ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è who dressed them today,1,82,16
"Saw Bigbang there, I am ready for Blackpink!",1,44,8
i dunno what Jisoo is wearing but damn she pulled it off really well,1,68,14
"Lisa's pants, how does she constantly pull everything off like that damn",1,72,12
Reverse BLACKED.,1,16,2
As soon as I saw this last night I booked a hotel room - it may be a 5 1/2 hour drive from where I am but that's okay!,1,118,29
Too true,1,8,2
Jisoo just walking straight ahead üòÇ,1,35,6
"Also a dude here, (and not your typical looking either) they just finished their concert here on our country last week, And I was not able to attend because tickets were sold out fast, and also Im a fairly new fan at the time of ticket selling (became their fan just this october) and I thought ""I'm not blink enough to attend"" so I didnt really made any effort to look for tix until last week of january came and I couldnt find any more legit sellers. Biggest regret so far lmao. I'd say go for it, what ever it takes, don't hesitate, my friend told me its super worth it!",1,573,111
"I know, she‚Äôs always been skinniest but lately I‚Äôve had the same worries. For someone who loves to eat it certainly doesn‚Äôt show!! Jisoo and Jennie both have the perfect weight in my opinion. Jisoo especially looked sexy as hell in this performance!",1,249,43
Oooph they were so nervous. Jisoo and Jennie both looked like they were going to throw up. It might have just been bad timing with the camera getting them and cutting away too fast. Vocals on point though!,1,205,38
"I have work at 7am the next day, and I‚Äôll be coming in from NYC as well. I‚Äôve also been anticipating their concert ever since they announced a world tour so I‚Äôve been budgeting for them, bc yes their tickets will be expensive. But everything is going to be SO WORTH it. It‚Äôs a once in a lifetime opportunity and I have no doubt in my mind that I‚Äôm going to have an AMAZING time. They rarely come here! I‚Äôm also ecstatic that they rented a huge venue bc they are going to 100% sell out. I prefer MSG as well, but as long as BP are coming to the tri state area, I am not complaining. ",1,582,117
"Oof. And you know stans are gonna stand outside for hours to get near the stage in GA. For those of us who cant take 2 days off work, GA may be untenable compared to the lowest rows of the bowl. Will wait to see Chicago's seating chart.",1,236,48
If Red velvet can sell out in Toronto in 5 minutes I think blackpink will be able to sellout in Hamilton. ,1,106,21
When any venue is at least like 500 miles From your house ,1,58,12
"Where can I watch the show, now? I passed out too early :(",1,58,13
Rose looking a bit on the dangerous side of thin lately D:,1,58,12
When's the next time you'll get to see BP? You can always retake a class,1,72,15
I'm trying to decide if I want to go to Chicago vs Atlanta. ,1,60,13
One of their best D4 performance i could say,1,44,9
Which date are you going to? I'm in the same situation but I'm going to shows 98% of the time alone. &amp;#x200B;,1,113,22
I jumped on here to check for a live vid of last night. I watched it live. I saw your post and thought I'd have to watch the GMA performance after the fact. I forgot I work from home today! I don't care what they sing on GMA but I do hope they pick one other song :-D,1,267,58
"With lower supply and the same demand it is true that prices go up, especially if you have to buy tickets from scalpers. However, it costs a. LOT more money to have a concert in an arena than in a small concert hall. Renting the venue, tech, staging, staff, insurance, everything costs way more. The face value ticket prices can be cheaper, but not drastically. The KCON NY 2018 tickets were 50/100/150 for one night of a two night arena show. The Redmare tickets are 69/89/129/169/199. So more, but not drastically more, relatively speaking. I‚Äôm used to going to metal shows with $20 or less general admission even when the band comes all the way from Europe to a really small place. That‚Äôs what a concert should be. Something you can just go to on a whim for a good time, like a movie, and not be too upset if it‚Äôs lame. The thing is at a metal show you don‚Äôt really need to see very much. Just gotta hear. At a KPop show there is dancing to watch. Being close to the front suddenly matters. Even the cheapest seat in a theatre you can usually see the stage pretty well. That cheap seat in the arena, you may as well just go home and watch fan cams since you‚Äôll be looking at a video screen the whole time anyway.",1,1215,230
"At such an insane price, it had best include something crazy like backstage passes.",1,83,14
I was waiting for them to come on.. I passed out around 12:22 üôÉ I have to be up at 7am. If only I could have lasted another 8 mins üò≠,1,132,31
"Black VIP in Berlin is like 534‚Ç¨ so probably more then $500, Pink VIP was 364‚Ç¨ tho.",1,83,17
Any idea where I can watch the whole thing? Or did they only do a single performance?,1,85,17
"For europe the VIP tickets took longer to sell out, as they are significantly more expensive. Black VIP went up to 535‚Ç¨ and last I looked for the Berlin show everything **but** VIP was sold out",1,193,36
They all look happy at the end but LOOK AT THE SMILE ON JENNIE SHES SO HAPPY! Great job girls now you‚Äôre about to kill it again on GMA! ,1,136,29
our rich queens,1,15,3
"I think it's one of the best live performances i've seen yet. Perfect way to bring the new generation of female Kpop to the US. I hope they start a trend of more talent coming here, more than just K-Con.",1,203,40
Are there any fan meetups for this show?,1,40,8
I wish Boston!!!!,1,17,3
"Maybe just Anti's but yeah, it's the most obviously live performance I've seen, and one of the best.",1,100,18
"Don‚Äôt even think about not going. I can‚Äôt even tell you how many awesome experiences I‚Äôve missed out in because I was worried about going alone. Especially with concerts, once the music starts everyone is just a huge crowd. The most fun I‚Äôve had at a music festival was when my friends left me because they weren‚Äôt interested in the artist that was playing. ",1,358,64
I‚Äôm going the Manchester show and been thinking the same but just thought fuck it it‚Äôs probably a couple more years before any of the other groups I like do a world tour and who knows if and when blackpink will be back in my area. (Thanks to everyone‚Äôs reassuring reply‚Äôs to this too btw :) ),1,292,57
Weid time to say this considering how clearly you could hear them. The playback was much lower there than during their DDDD promotion in Korea last year. ,1,154,27

"Nah kpop companies just plan super last minute while western artists book venues months even a year in advance... There's only so few arenas out there and the ACC in Toronto has sports playoffs going on around that time... For most of the dates, either it's on a weekday or the location isn't great. This reflects how the tour planning wasn't the greatest... Trust me if they could they would play Toronto, it's just so much easier especially since they will be staying there. ",1,477,84
I agree; they looked so tired. They need a better balanced schedule. ,1,69,12

I love the girls but lets be objective, they're not the strongest live performers and their music isn't the only reason we're fans, we know they're funny, sweet and caring girls, but the general public doesn't care about that and I'm worried for them. If you go over to  and look up any thread about Blackpink, there's so much hating going on its ridiculous... Some people are calling them a waste of resources, they called their Sure thing cover a bad karaoke, etc. I do believe they're hyped a bit too much now, it doesn't correspond with their talent. They're good, but not a top kpop group in terms of live performances and I really don't want them to receive anymore hate.",1,693,126

I've never been to a K-pop concert period, but last year I went to a concert alone for Lea Michele &amp; Darren Criss. I was a bit nervous too but you know what? I had the time of my life! It was a ball, such a beautiful show, and I would be so sad if I had missed it just because my husband didn't really want to go with me. (He was willing, but wasn't super interested in the music, and honestly, I got a way better view by spending the money on a better seat instead of two far-back seats for someone who didn't really want to be there!) IMHO, once the show starts, you're not talking to anyone anyway and no one is paying attention to you, they're watching the show, so it won't matter you're alone or who you are.

"This show is a big nope for me. Ticket is going to cost a lot of money, but BLACKPINK doesn‚Äôt really have a lot of songs. I like them, but that show can‚Äôt be very long. Doesn‚Äôt seem worth it compare to Red Velvet (this weekend!) who have a ton of material. 8PM on a Wednesday in Newark. I would have to leave work and rush to Newark on the train. Then I would have to go all the way back to NYC late at night. Way too inconvenient. Would be more doable on a weekend. Big arena show. Tickets that are close will cost a fortune. Affordable tickets will be so far away as to not even be worth going. Smaller venue would be better. Winner played at the Hulu theater at MSG. Why couldn‚Äôt they go there? Hope anyone who goes has fun, but I‚Äôm gonna sit this one out.",1,759,152
Can anyone recommend any good hotels or places to stay near Newark? I've never been to New Jersey before. I'm gonna have to travel from Boston!,1,143,26
Is the venue good? My friend is loathing Newark. I'm tempted to make the trip down to Atlanta on my way to FL. ,1,111,23
"It's for the purposes of the show. Late-night shows air at night, but they are recorded earlier in the day. It's more convenient for the crew, the guests and a studio audience to record it during the daytime but show it on TV at night. So, when they performed it, it was live for the audience and the camera, but now when we see it on TV, it's the recording of the earlier live performance.",1,390,75

However, I feel that I‚Äôve really grown as a person because of them. They inspire me to work harder and have shown me that hard work really does pay off. I‚Äôve become much more open-minded and understanding of other people. They‚Äôre kind, humble, genuine, talented, hardworking, and they‚Äôre honestly my role models. When I say I want to be like them, I definitely don‚Äôt want to be an idol, but I want to be able to inspire others and to positively impact everyone around me the way they do. I look up to them, the same way young athletes would look up to another athlete. And I feel like nobody takes me seriously when I try to explain. People act like I would be the type of fan to get angry if they ever dated, but I would support whatever relationship they got into. Part of it is the whole ‚Äú12 year old fans‚Äù kind of mindset. Even older ARMYS look down on the younger fans because they think we‚Äôre insensitive but we all like Bangtan for the same reasons. And to put it simply, they make us happy.

"I've never seen a seating chart with prices....let us know if you find it! Short answer--about $220 to $300 depending on section, night, and probably city. Long answer: below: Also, btw, I'm selling my extra tickets for Metlife Sunday 5/19, sec 117 row 19 &amp; sec 139 row 26, face value, $221 &amp; $262! DM me, anyone, if interested!! I have been puzzled by ""face value"" for tickets as well. I have tickets for both nights in NJ &amp; pricing seems to be different for each night (I have sec 139 ticket that cost $303 for Saturday &amp; same section (lower row!) for $262 on Sunday. TM also seems to have their own rubric for what's desirable (which doesn't mesh with my thinking) and charges more. I prefer to be close to the extended stage, so I can see both stages head on. TM seems to value sections closer to the main stage (where I feel you're looking at the boys' backs a lot when they are on extended stage). So my tickets near the extended stage (sec 116/117) cost $221 but section 139 (btw the two stages) is higher. My floor ticket, just got yesterday (SO excited!) from TM was $262. So hopefully that gives you some idea. I think probably each venue &amp; each night are different, The $303 is the highest I've seen, I think, for face value. &amp;#x200B;",0,1269,232

"That was a really well constructed survey. Are you showing off a bit? (Am teasing you in the nice way :-)) One note: there's a question about what we do as individuals followed immediately by a question about the larger implications of what we do as individuals ... which might invite a very few people to put, and even judge, their actions in context and a different light. People tend to give answers that make themselves look good (even in anonymous surveys) so a very few people might go back to revisit some of their earlier answers. It's a small thing but, if you consider and discuss it in your paper ... the self-aware student usually gets the better grade. Many other notes: Very well worded questions ... short, simple, easy to read ... easy to understand ... easy to answer ... but still substantial and open ended questions. Very hard to do this right so ... Nice work! Also ... Good layout. And an excellent length too ... not exhausting but still thorough and complete and satisfying for the survey taker. Most importantly, I think you gave it to the right people :-) Anyway, lots of room for a good grade with much that will be learned. Thank you for posting this. Like everyone else here, I really enjoyed doing it and am eager to know what you find out :-)",0,1273,232

"People develop expectations very quickly after watching the CB trailer. Because their albums tend to be diverse, I doubt we'll get a full album that is entirely hip-hop focused. Based on their previous ones, I think they'll stick with a pop influence and the usual rap + ballad tracks. BTS tends to stick with a common theme throughout their albums, not a genre.",0,362,63
"tbh when i first watched the trailer, i thought 'oh now we're going hiphop.' i kinda solidified that idea already in my head. but when the concept photos dropped i... don't know anymore. i personally like their genre-hopping, my taste ranges from loud songs (fire, not today) to chill ones (rain, i like it). so far i am really satisfied as a fan and even if this album will not stick to hiphop (a genre i don't kinda like that much), it's fine for me. i can't say the same for those planning to ""re-stan"" after they heard persona because they are really expecting that bts will be returning to their old sound this time around. and to be more honest it's the title track i'm nervous about. this time i'm hoping it's hiphop and sounds nothing like idol or dna. bts rapline is very strong so i'm expecting they'll let them shine in the title track this time around. and i personally think they're not sacrificing their quality or sound ever since they blew up. man, dna,fake love and idol (especially) were never GP-friendly songs. they just do what they want to do. just hope they won't sacrifice their songs' quality for the sake of the narrative they're pushing though.",0,1171,211
"Namjoon - Athena because she was the goddess of wisdom and was a capable leader.She was also associated with strategic warfare(military strategy) and I assume was quite logical and able to withstand hardships as she was called *Promachos* ( ""she who fights in front"") and I tie that into how Namjoon represent the group very well and takes all attacks for the team.She was also said to be very keen and sharp of eye,as well as skillful. Athena was praised for her compassion and generosity , embodied wisdom and rational thought. Athena could be a fierce and ruthless warrior too (RM the fierce rapper).She was also the goddess of inspiration, civilization, as well as law and justice. Namjoon is very creative and has a lot of inspirations and he is in my opinion very aware of civilization's nature and of what is right and wrong,always striving to be a better persona and learn from his mistakes. Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom, the arts, and classical learning,and Namjoon is very intelligent,wise,well-educated and artistic.Maybe Demeter too with his love for nature and for being the goddess of growth,organic in her case and spiritual and personal in Namjoon's. &amp;#x200B; Jimin - Aphrodite because she was the goddess of beauty, love and desire-sexuality. Jimin is very beautiful and elegant-graceful , very caring and loving with people and can be very shameless and sexy at times, oozing sex appeal.Aphrodite was also rumoured to be quite tempestuous and we know Jimin has a temper and can be very scary when angered.Aphrodite was also described to have a very sweet and pleasing voice like honey and Jimin has such a sweet singing voice but can be quite soft-spoken too.Aphrodite was also said to have had many lovers and Jmin can be pretty flirty and tactile with anyone.Aphrodite was also the goddess of passion and we know how passionate and hard working Jimin is. In Laconia, Aphrodite was worshipped as a warrior goddess and Jimin used to do both Taekwondo and Kendo.One of Aphrodite's most common literary epithets is Philommeid·∏ós which means ""smile-loving"",as she was often depicted as not with a smile on her face but also loving seeing others smile.Jimin has a lovely smile and he loves people smiling.SHe was also said to be very seductive and to hold grudges.We have also seen how sensual Jimin can be and know of his little accidents and the others have said that he can hold grudges. &amp;#x200B; Hoseok - Hestia because she was the goddess of the hearth , home , domesticity and family. I think Hobi is one of the members that keeps the band together and united,taking care of them and understanding their needs.He is the energy of the group like how the heart provides energy to the home.He also has a great bond with his family and he has mentioned that they keep him going.He can be really domestic with the members and is a very warm person.Hestia is described as a kind, forgiving and discreet goddess with a passive non-confrontational nature, and I think hat applies to Hobi too.On the other hand, Hestia was also very much protective and could get quite fierce like Hobi. Generally,she was not given much characterization and description in mythology so I also tie that into how the members have said Hobi is very adaptable and how mysterious he can seem,like a closed book but that he is the energy and warmth of the team.Hestia was essentially the flame,the energy source and while she was mild-mannered she was immensely respected and treated well,even admired.That respect might have been because the flame can be volatile too and angering it can only cause damage. I think that counts for Hobi as well. &amp;#x200B; Taehyung - A combination of Apollo and Dionysus . First of all , Apollo was the god of Music , Poetry and Art and Taehyung has been showing and increasing level of interest in both music and art and has started delving deeper into both.He was also the god of healing,light and the sun and we all know how sunny and warm Taehyung can be and how healing his presence can be as stated by Jimin because of his purity. As the protector of young, Apollo was concerned with the health of children and we know Taehyung's affinity with children and he was also the protector of herds and flocks and Taehyung has an affinity with animals as well.As for Dionysus,he was the god of theater and we know how theatrical Taehyung can be with his amazing expressions and acting.He was also the god of ritual madness and ecstasy and was often called Eleutherios, meaning ‚Äúthe liberator,‚Äù because his wine, music, and ecstatic dance freed his followers from self-conscious fear and care, and subvert the oppressive restraints . In that way he represented freedom and we all know how free-spirited Taehyung can be and how sometimes he could be the opposite of self-conscious.He was also described as possessing an androgynous beauty and I feel that for Taehyung as well. &amp;#x200B; Yoongi - A combination of Hyphaestus and Hades. First , Hyphaestus was the god of carpenters , craftsmen and artisans. Yoongi has said multiple times how interested he has always been in making things , taking them apart and building them and how interested he is in furniture and electronics.Hephaestus was also the patron god of the arts and we know how much Yoongi loves music.Hephaestus was the god of fire too.Yoongi's rap is fire,nothing more to say.Passionate and burning.Hephaestus like Yoongi was also crafty and quite smart and although he seemed fierce and angry , he was a kind and peace-loving god , like Yoongi.As for Hades , he was the God of Night and Dreams and we know how much Yoongi loves both sleeping and staying up at night.Hades was also the god of wealth and riches and we know how Yoongi often said his greed was a shackle and how wealthy he is now compared to how he grew up. Hades was depicted as stern and unyielding, unmoved by things and that was how Yoongi was initially seen like.Hades might have also loved music as he was so moved by Orpheus song that he allowed him to take Eurydike back to the land of the living. &amp;#x200B; Seokjin - A combination of Eros and the Roman God Janus.First of all , Eros was the god of love and was depicted as extremely handsome.Jin is very very handsome and very caring and loving.Eros was also depicted as mischievous and meddling in the affairs of gods and mortals caused bonds of love to form and drama to unfold. Jin can be very mischievious and playful and can cause a lot of drama but he is also very supportive.As for Janus, he was the Roman God of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways, passages, and ending . I tie that to the fact that Jin started from the beginning with no experience whatsoever bu taking advantage of a passage,a doorway,an opportunity that was given to him.Through very hard work and time he transitioned to the level he is now and there is no ending to his improvement as of yet. Janus symbolized change and transitions such as the progress of past to future, from one condition to another, from one vision to another, and young people's growth to adulthood but also all the states in between those.I tie that into Jin progressing so so much and still possessing a vision for even more progress.I also consider Jun to be quite mature but to also be carefree and playful , so like Janus represented the middle ground between youth and adulthood, Jin does too.Janus was also depicted as having two faces and representing duality and I also think that Jin also has a dual nature. &amp;#x200B; Jungkook - Hermes, because he is the god of sports and athletes and we all know how athletic Jungkook is and how much he loves all kinds of sports. In the *Iliad*, Hermes was called ""the bringer of good luck"", ""guide and guardian"", and ""excellent in all the tricks"".We all know how lucky Jungkook is and can be and how excellent he is at everything and I tied the guide adjective as him leading the choreos and being center quite often.Hermes was also described as quite the trickster as well , mostly for his own satisfaction or to benefit others and I think Jungkook fits that as well.He can be quite the trickster at times , often loving teasing the other members for his satisfaction or for their benefit,to cheer them up,He can also be quite funny and crafty to make both them or us laugh. Hermes was also described as having a mastery of persuasion and special pleading...I tie that to Jungkook having Bambi eyes and the members not being able to say no to him.ARMYs too. Hermes is also the patron and protector of travelers, herdsmen, thieves, orators and wit, literature and poets, athletics and sports, invention and trade.As such,his interests were considered to be varied and widespread,just like Jungkook.Jungkook is interested and wants to try so many things. &amp;#x200B;",0,8836,1531

"I‚Äôm going to the Bangkok concert on Saturday. It will be my 17th time seeing them live since I started this life-style change in 2017. Living in Korea has made me very lucky in this regard.

I‚Äôm nervous about Muster lottery but I remind myself, despite that outcome, I‚Äôm very fortunate in my ARMY life. I had a rough week at work because of insecure, toxic co-workers I thought were friends who hurt me. I‚Äôve caused no harm to anyone. I was minding my own business and happily living my own life, and for some reason that was scary and threatening to them. Luckily I‚Äôm too wise to get caught up and dragged down with them so I‚Äôm just distancing myself from the negativity but this week.... I am *so deeply grateful* I have the boys to make me smile, to follow to new countries/experiences, and to support for comeback. Some people never gave themselves permission to just be happy in life. So instead of seeing all the reasons to be happy and enjoy life, they create problems from those dark whispers in their minds. I feel bad for them.

So I watched some scenes of Boys over flowers on Netflix to see what the hype is about and got the second lead syndrome (the second lead in it has a much bigger,sadder and self sacrificial role). So then I looked up that actor and turned out he was part of a very famous 2nd gen kpop group. So I watched a couple of videos of his singles and group and I was like woah kpop was doing such amazing videos in 2005??? Also I love videos with great choreo, etc. as I am used to that in Bollywood, love dancing myself and was sick of Hollywood videos. I didn't look any further though because I knew it could get addicting and I don't have time but Youtube knows how to pull you in.

Not gonna lie, they can hurt a bit, and if you‚Äôre body shy, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time, because those ladies get in everywhere with no shame. But they also feel like the best backscratch you‚Äôve ever had, on your entire body. And having a no-nonsense Auntie literally scrubbing and bathing you like a baby is deeply comforting. Follow it with an oil massage, hair wash and condition, and a nap in a warm dark room. The place I go to has a restaurant, cozy reading nooks, the whole deal.

Well they are 7 people, of course they want to try new genre. Each of their album has different vibe following their concept and never the same. Come one this kind of discussion happen everytime time they release an album, though it is alright to have an expectation because everyone has their own preference. Will they able satisfy everyone?

Like I can take lay my hand palm toward my face, with the index finger lining up right along my brow bone. I lift my brow (the skin and muscles) up towards my hairline. While lifting, use your brow muscles and try to furrow your brow like you're squinting. It may hurt a bit but it shouldn't be too bad--more like hitting a pressure point which is a good hurt. Keep pressing and furrowing for 30 seconds to a minute (30 secs are good for your first few times) and release. The eyebrow you just released will now look higher than your unreleased eyebrow. Well, at least mine does. I do this type of resistance training with all my facial muscles and it really does make a difference especially if you're consistant.",0,1053,192

"I'd be as disappointed as I've been since YF i suppose... I think I rode the pop wave of Bangtan okay I guess. After 2016 I came to grips with it. But last year, with Tear and Ddaeng and now this year with Persona, I think they're pivoting back toward their earlier sound. I guess we won't know until the album drops but I don't foresee this album being full of pop music, just bc of all the hints they'd dropped. Bringing back ORUL82 at the gayos last year and then the whole Armypedia thing I think is their way of gearing fans back that way. Reminding them of old songs from Bangtan and older sounds that they're about to bring back so new pop-based fans won't be shocked by the change. but that's just my take on it. I was right about Persona being a Joon intro based on these clues so I'm feeling about 80% confident that the album is probably going to be a hiphop heavy mix, kind of like HYYH pt 1 or 2 was. They're never going to go full Dark &amp; Wild on us again until rapline drops an official subunit though.

I just don't like it enough to listen all the way it I have the option to skip. That mentality is the reason why streaming services have now become the dominant way to listen to music. It's all about the ability to personalize. There's no question that BTS has never made a song half-assedly, but I agree that a return to their hip-hop/R&amp;B roots one day is one hell of a treat. And now that they have the Western markets tapping in on their every move, the genres more familiar to them, like rock and hip-hop, would better coincide with their tastes in music.",0,913,169

Either way, I get hyped to listen to new music lol. ",0,385,64
"I think it really builds a lot of suspense just giving us little pieces, and then the payoff hearing how it all fits together. I think the only time i was ever disappointed was Idol not having traditional instruments, but then we got finally got the payoff with the mma perf (which i pray every day they'll release that version on soundcloud for festa or something). But aside from Idol and Blood Sweat &amp; Tears, their teasers pretty strictly use musical phrases that are identical to how they are in the final version, they just have certain parts (or all) of the instrumental stripped back. I wouldn't really consider that misleading, and I don't even really qualify it as being stylistically different, but it is difficult to anticipate how the final version will sound. Personally, I really love hearing the little snippets of bare vocals like we got in the Fake Love and Spring Day teasers. They kind of do the same thing with the visuals too, where the cuts that they use aren't necessarily the same ones that are in the final mv (or in the case of the Fake Love first teaser, basically a prequel/stand alone mini short film), which I just think is kind of fun? And since the teasers are only released like, a few days before the actual mv/album, and I don't think many people base their preorder decisions solely on how the teaser sounds, I don't find it a problem in that regard. tl;dr: Perfectly fine to have a teaser that uses a clip directly from the song, but I don't think it generates the same kind of tense anticipation. Can definitely be a double-edged sword, but I wouldn't change it. I'm in for the wild ride.",0,1630,293

I think the main issue in the US is that most people don't live that close to the venue. Just as an example, for Chicago, obviously there are a lot of people who go from Chicago, but there are a good portion of people who go there that aren't from that area as well. For people who aren't from that area, they have to deal with hotels, planes, etc, and most people who pay *that* much to get there want good seats (i.e. floor/soundcheck/close 100-levels). Additionally, only people who live near Chicago can really suddenly plan their trip to Chicago when sites like Ticketmaster release a bunch of good seats the day before - most people don't like putting such a huge money investment into hotels and planes when they don't even have the guarantee of getting a ticket. Regardless, most ARMY who are in the loop with ARMY stuff generally wait until pretty close to the concert date to buy tickets because after all the times we've been dragged for a loop most of us have learned haha.",0,1301,236

"I‚Äôm still not recovered from the betrayal that was not including 134340 in Answer... I think their albums tend to start more cohesive in themes/genres than when they end, thinking about it. Wings pops up in my head as an album that starts pretty experimental but somewhat coherent thematically and then after the solos it becomes a lot more different. Love Yourself Her also starts as pure pop and following the theme of Her closely and then after the Skit changes in tone. Same change of thematic cohesiveness could be seen in Tear as well. Makes sense since they always try to include as much diversity in each album, even if that makes them not follow the themes as closely as they could.

"I made a similar post in the concert thread, but I guess I'll chime in. The numbers look as they do for a couple reasons I can think of: The Sunday shows are primarily the ones with a lot of tickets still available. Most people likely have to take an additional day off (Monday) from work whereas for Saturday they don't. Also, the Sunday shows were announced a week later after most fans bought tickets for Saturday. It's pretty expensive to attend both shows, if you're aiming for good seats. This is especially true if you're traveling from out of state/country because you need to account for an additional days hotel stay. Most fans who are local to the venues are likely going to buy secondary tickets closer to the concert date because they'll get it cheaper and since they're nearby they do not need to plan for travel. If you go through the buy/sell posts, you'll notice most people are trying to sell Sunday tickets and buy Saturday tickets. A Friday/Saturday concert works so much better for a lot of people compared to a Sunday show...especially when it's still school/finals season. Lastly, if you were to take the amount of tickets sold for the Sunday show and stuffed those people into a venue like Prudential in Newark, it'd be sold out. Stadiums host 2 to 3 times the amount of people than a traditional indoor venue. ",0,1335,237

For example, I mention the fact that BTS is part of a broader Korean cultural phenomenon known as the Hallyu wave, which is itself part of a fascinating effort on the part of the Korean government to promote its culture as an export industry and boost its own tourism industry. I also talk about issues such as: ¬∑ the idol music system in Korea and how BTS managed to flourish in spite of domination of the market by larger companies (though this is changing), ¬∑ the strong relationship that kpop groups develop with their fans and how BTS in particular has fostered this relationship, ¬∑ the immense global reach of the fanbase and how incredibly organized it is, ¬∑ the numerous ways in which BigHit is capitalizing on the BTS brand &amp;#x200B; I don‚Äôt talk about their music much-- my friends and family have different tastes. I also do not talk about how adorable Yoongi looks when he‚Äôs sleeping, how cute Jimin looked in bunny ears in the latest Run!BTS, or what Namjoon said in his latest vlive or log. I rely on this subreddit to get all emotional about that stuff. ",0,1540,286

"I'm glad their teasers are ambiguous.

Those motifs can come from anywhere in the song. Perhaps they think it gives a different feel than the visuals suggested?

Point being that when you're as big as BTS, it's good not to think too much about what other people think about your music. I'd rather they branch out creatively in whatever suits them. A hip-hop heavy album would be interesting, but it's not something I'd be heartbroken over if it doesn't happen.

"Okay so, as a musician who writes arrangements often, there are *so many ways to arrange the same song*. Usually the melody suits tons of different genres, keys, and tempos. Next, it seems like BigHit works by having multiple producers produce a track and then comparing to see which one is best, instead of everyone making one track together. BigHit has many talented producers and they‚Äôre each biased by their musical preferences. The result is that you‚Äôll probably get multiple versions/remixes of the same song that sound *awesome*. But if you release multiple versions on paid websites, it‚Äôll seem like you‚Äôre indecisive. So what do they do? Instead of scrapping everyone else‚Äôs work, they release one version as the ‚Äúteaser‚Äù. If people don‚Äôt like the teaser, no problem, the title track sounds very different.

"BTS likes to genre-hop and try out new sounds so I don't expect a 100% hiphop album. Love Yourself wasn't 100% pop, hiphop, rnb, 100% anything. It was a lot of different, creative songs that when played back-to-back weren't consistently sonically cohesive, but lyrically the theme was present in the entire LY series. To me, the concept of 'Persona' has the potential for a plethora of different topics, and with those topics come varying sounds and genres played with by BTS to best fit what emotions and feelings they're trying to express personally and evoke in listeners. I feel like BTS fans will understand whatever direction the boys decide to take. If anything, I would like to think that fans would appreciate the album even more should it experiment with differing sounds (which could be experimenting with hiphop genres, or genre-hopping completely). A lot of fans admire bangtan's willingness to defy the conventions of the kpop soundscape in the name of their own passion for music. And from the comeback trailer, it's clear that they don't plan on 'selling out' or resorting to making music solely for the mainstream (which I know has been a concern of some in the past.) In 'Persona' RM's lyrics have passion, conviction, honesty. That's one of their selling points that keeps fans dedicated whether BTS decides to release an album like LY:HER or an album like Dark and Wild. I know this isn't a very cohesive comment and I'm kind of all over the place. But to sum it up I would say that the integrity and authenticity of BTS' music, so long as it's present in the execution and lyrics, outweighs the importance of the overall genre/direction that the boys decide to take with each series/album.

Short answer: I love their music and enjoy the content they put out but it's more complex than that. When I listen to a song I really love (from any artist) I literally listen to it hundreds of times until it feels like it because I part of me. I'm very emotionally driven when I listen to music.

"I trust that no matter what genre(s) they put out, the production will be top notch. I‚Äôm a huge fan of rock/hip hop and Persona was literally the embodiment of all my favorite music, but if they go with a different direction for the rest of the album, I‚Äôll still be happy. The majority of Love Yourself: Tear sounded happy or poppy despite supposedly being a ‚Äúdepressing‚Äù album. 134340, Love Maze, Magic Shop, Anpanman, Airplane pt. 2, So What. The only songs that really matched the audible theme of Tear was the intro, outro, title track and The Truth Untold. Even through the TONE of the songs were more poppy, the lyrics and meaning spoke for the concept. I have a feeling that Map of the Soul: Persona will be the same way. Most of the album being poppy/other genres with a few of the tracks being more hiphop based. But all of them will have the ‚Äúdiscovering and accepting all facets of yourself‚Äù meaning. Title track wise, just like with Fake Love sounding both pop and emo, we‚Äôll probably get a song that has definite hip hop vibes but with a pop spin. Big Hit is really good at providing a genre for everyone no matter their taste. It‚Äôs why ARMY is so diverse. We have diehard hip hop heads that go bonkers over tracks like Outro: Tear, Ddaeng and the Cyphers. We got R&amp;B and soul fans that salivate over Singularity, The Truth Untold and Stigma. And of course the pop crowd that appreciate the hype tracks like DNA, So What and Interlude: Wings I think whatever they come out with will be amazing :)",0,1513,277

I also know many people thought ""Her"" wasn't strong, though I believe it is. No matter how high the sales may be, I think some people will still be unhappy (like with LY). But I also think BTS always produces quality work, and that their fanbase has only grown during the time of their newer sounds, which means BTS clearly doesn't have to rely mostly on hip-hop to succeed. Whatever people's disappointments may be, I think the music itself will be strong enough, no matter the genre, that most people will be pleased and find multiple songs to enjoy. The value I do see in incorporating more of their older sound is that it will feel like an emotional reward for long-time or hardcore fans who are attached to the entirety of the BTS discography and who want BTS' older style to now receive more public attention and recognition.",0,1013,183

I personally reallyyyyyy doubt that we will have an album or even just a main track that is completely hip hop based.

I'm not like screaming it from the mountain tops, but I don't mind making it known. If someone asks, I'll tell them. A lot of times, yes it's met with a weird reaction, but if they continue to be weird about it and say that the boys look like ""girls"" and the same old shit that I've been hearing for like a decade, I just chalk it up to ignorance. It's 2019 people! I met a girl at a kpop concert for another group who, in her very bitter head space, told me that if she were me, she would be embarrassed to have anything public (like a bumper sticker) that showed she liked BTS because she would not want to be associated with ARMY. I can admit a select few in this fandom are a lil off their rocker, but jesus christ. Seriously? Since then I have made a point to be even more shameless, partly out of spite bc I'm petty, but also because I'm proud to like BTS!

"Based loosely on Percy Jackson by Rick Riordan beause I learened Greek mythology more from his books than in school. Lol. * Namjoon - son of Athena for sure. I know you said to avoid cliche but I can't think of any other ""cabin"" (reference to Percy Jackson) more apt to place Namjoon than in the Athena cabin. He breathes book and wisdom; also competitive. * Seokjin - son of Poseidon. He is good in underwater swimming, water boarding, snow boarding, and likes fishing too. His easy going but serious and reliable in times of need personality also reminds me of Percy (from the book). * Yoongi - son of Hephaestus. He likes technology and likes fixing and building things, especially those that require the use of hands. * Hoseok - son of Apollo. Not because of the sunshine thing but because Hobi is very versatile like how Apollo is a god of almost everthing else--music, art, poetry, etc. * Jimin - son of Hermes. He likes to update us via twitter and fancafe, and likes sharing bts photos of BTS (ha!); can be abit of a trickster too. * Taehyung - son of Aphrodite. He has this sensual, striking kind of handsomeness like on how he strikes poses during shoots and projects on camera. He also gives me the impression that he gives importance to ""aesthetics"". * Jungkook - son of Zeus or Hades. Honestly, going back to Riordan's Percy Jackson series, JK reminds me of Nico d'Angelo (son of Hades) for some reason. Maybe because Nico is somewhat of an emo looking kid but is actually a total softie. But if we talk about what the gods are commonly known for, I feel like JK fits more to be a son of Zeus because of the physical display of power.",0,1647,302

"Yep! Look up ""facial massages"" and ""facial exercises"" on YouTube. You look like an idiot doing them but they do help.

For instance I have trigger points right around the base of my inner eyebrows--I have to roll my thumb along that bone until I find them. Once I've released them, my eyebrows relax and go up about a few cms. Makes me go from slightly tense looking to happy and relaxed. I also have some right in the grove at the base of my cheeks (I guess it's a sinus trigger point?) and one on the right notch along my jaw (near my ear).

I wanted to bring it up in a conversation about music, (he also listened to cypher pt 4 cause i was a dumbass and unplugged my earphones and all my coleagues heard the song). But with his ""superior"" taste of music, i find it a bit hard to talk about bts. Since you know the usual misconceptions. Yesterday he asked me if they have plastic surgery(i guess he tried to look them up online). And when i told he that they are going to release an album and told him that they got inspired from Carl Jung, he said, ""why would a korean group get inspired from Jung, i don't believe it"". I told him that the reason why i like them is because they have a message behind their music, not just random lyrics and he agreed that that's what he is looking for when listening to music. but sigh... he seems to have too many misconceptions and i don't really enjoy trying to explain people why i like bts or to try to show people that they are different. I think i'm just going to enjoy them by myself. But the truth is, i didn't even tell my parents that i like bts, I said that i like a korean group and that i will go to their concert, but i didn't want to show myself as the fangirl I am.

I'm just...embarrassed about it, and it's so different from my other interests that I don't really feel like it represents me or know how to deal with it? My main interests in the past have been largely book-focused, and it's really different for me to be watching a lot of videos now and have little to no content for my interest that's not technology-based (instead of reading a book for the main activity, I watch videos, read stuff online, or listen to music). This is in addition to the fact that I'm used to having violent feelings about book characters, where they aren't real and completely obsessing over them can be a little odd but isn't really a problem, instead of real people who I don't actually personally know, where I feel like I need to be more cautious and I'm also not really sure what would be acceptable to the people around me who aren't surrounded by BTS fandom. For instance, I don't know if my family would take issue with my calling one of the members ""my tiny baby boy"" so I wouldn't use that kind of language around them, whereas I will call book characters ""my tiny baby boy"" with absolutely no hesitation. I'm also kind of scared of being stigmatized for my interest by some people, and I really don't want to look like the kind of person that they'd assume I was.

It reminded me a lot of seeing Bieber struggle publicly and openly admit to experiencing a dark night of the soul. V is a free spirit and cannot have his emotions or feelings stifled. I think one of the reasons he enjoys acting is because it‚Äôs one of the times he doesn‚Äôt stutter or stumble on his words. I remember an interview where they were asked about the differences between Korean and American talk shows and he mentioned that in America there‚Äôs fewer hierarchies based on factors like age and seniority.

"RM is extremely well-spoken in Korean and I feel like a lot of his eloquence is unfortunately lost in translation or when he speaks in English. He comes across as very confident, well-read, and thoughtful. V is the complete opposite, haha, especially in formal settings. I always hold my breath when he comes up to the mic cause when he says something ""wrong,"" you can tell he beats himself up about it. I think it's more nerves than anything but he does have a tendency to use odd words or phrases to get his point across. There's a reason Korean fans have even come up with a term for the way he speaks (TaeTae language). When he's just with his group mates, he sounds much more natural and carefree. Suga is very direct and blunt. Jimin...just the way he talks is so fucking cute it hurts, especially when he's doing vlives. But a more impish, bullish personality comes through when he's not simply catering to fans and just having fun with the guys. Jungkook just sounds like the maknae...which makes the nunas (like me) see him perpetually as a kid, haha. He also has a very faint lisp that comes out every once in a while. I don't know whether it's real or he just does it to sound cuter but if it's the latter it's working. Jhope is also kinda like Suga in that he's pretty direct and to the point with his words but whereas Suga is monotone and deadpan, Jhope is the exact opposite. He's very cheery, very bright, full of energy. Jin is kinda whiny and immature but obviously in a playful manner. He likes to keep things light and not too serious. But he is very polite and respectful when not with the boys (when he's MCing, on variety, etc). I feel like a lot of this can be conveyed even without understanding Korean but that's my impression of the way they speak off the top of my head.",0,1798,334

"feel like I'm late but here goes (perspective from a guy). I've worn their concert merch (hat, shirt, hoodie) to places like the gym, mall, restaurants, in the city, and sometimes work. I low-key expect someone to approach me and bring something up but it's never happened in over a year and a half. I play their music all the time (but I also listen to a lot of various K-pop artists) with the windows down without shame, even at stop lights. however I don't keep it blaring loud because that's just obnoxious. the only time I don't play their music (or K-pop in general) is if there are others with me because they'd be like wtf are you listening to and I don't wanna have that conversation. also, I try to be accommodating to others with music as my tastes are very abstract so I don't wanna put on something others wouldn't like or understand. my sister knows I listen to K-pop and that's probably the most personal thing she knows about me lol ",0,949,175

"The attic ceiling in version 3 reminds me more of Jung‚Äôs dream house and how it functions as a symbol for the human psyche or soul. Each story in the symbolic house corresponds to a level in the psyche and in this metaphor, the top floor and most superficial layer represents the persona. The personas depicted here though are ones that are consuming and inflexible. Like you said, their body language conveys a certain artifice. It‚Äôs as if they have evolved personalities that are all personas and this is no further accentuated in version 4 where they find themselves weighed down in the campiest accessories and colors and patterns, posing like classic antiquity figures, their literal demographic opposites (young, alive, and, Asian vs. old, dead, and Western). Taking a step back, we can also find evidence of the supersession of the specific personas in the decreasing number of individual photos. We start with 22, then go to 5, 2, then 1 from version 1 to 4. The mood of the concept photos also follow the same trend. Version 1 starts off the most playful, version 2 we get a tonal shift in the main panel of the individual photo and group photo, et cetera. ",0,1166,204

That's what I'm thinking as well. Since the intro is a callback to the previous album, that's it. The job is already done.

I had a bit of money in my google account so I suggested her to buy a copy of ""Love Yourself: Answer"" on google music and she listens to it almost everyday with her headphone. Its nice that she is fan of BTS and how she tries her best to contribute to their success...but, unfortunately, we have limitations due to our dad. My mom has a close friend of hers who gave her a BTS ticket in Chicago on May as her birthday present. She couldn't describe how happy she was when she received the news. I was to look for the shop with my dad if she leaves for Chicago on Saturday, but I was more than willing to do it if it meant that she would be able to fulfill her dreams. However, my dad disapproved of it. All we had to do was send her to Chicago for a day and let her enjoy the dream she had been hoping for years. However, all the excitement died the moment my dad rejected it. I can't describe how powerless I felt when I couldn't raise my opinion and reason why she should go to Chicago concert. It wasn't as if we weren't able to make well-constructed argument against him. Not only did he become owner of the store because of my mom's relations, she did many things for our family when we first settled in US. I could go on more if anyone wants to know about it. Anyhow, in short, we live in an oppressive environment where it is hard for us to express our opinions. I just want to know if you guys can suggest me a way for us to convince him. ",0,1841,367

Though, there are some who do know about our boys and its really nice seeing their day light up, but to those who don't, you can just see it in their faces.. I don't hide my love for them either. I have a group photocard at the back of my phone and Jimin as my lockscreen and wallpaper. I also have mono as my laptop's loading screen and another group photo as my desktop wallpaper. These devices are always with me so if anyone peeps, they'll see them. If they ask about them, I'll gladly talk about them. I also attend birthday events held by ARMYs in my city. So I'd literally be walking around my city with cup sleeves of our boys' faces. My family and friends know about my admiration towards them too.

[It's a Man's World](  by James Brown-This track was sampled in Agust D, so why not get to know the original track? DOPE- [La pluie](  by Orelson ft. Stromae (French).

Another rapper bragging about coming from nothing to something, but Logic has a similar philosophical base that BTS has and similar experiences with anxiety and depression Autumn Leaves (or just Tae's soulful tone and you wish he sang about happy things)-[Twist](  by Nathan Sykes.

Love is Not Over-[Craving](  by Matt Woods soft vocals that kind of feel like they are reaching out for something Rain/Outro: Do You Think it Makes Sense?-[Blind Man](  by Xavier Omar. Smooth 90s R&amp;B vibes. Run-[home ft. WALK THE MOON](  by morgxn. The chorus just gives me Run vibes. The repeating notes in the chorus just do it. This one has more of a bass feel than Run. But I like it. Epiphany-[Thursday](  by Jess Glynne. Beautiful vocals and all about learning to love yourself. Paradise, Airplane pt 2-[Valentino](  by Years and Years and MNEK. Similar guitar to Airplane pt 2, and includes MNEK, who helped write Paradise Young Forever, You Never Walk Alone-[Jag ar fri](  by Jon Henrik Fjallgren (Swedish). Manages to be sweeping, epic, and emotional at the same time Ddaeng/Daydream (weird combo, I know)-[Barbie](  by Static and Ben El (Hebrew). Uses traditional sounds for something more modern. Not the greatest lyrics, but super catchy and upbeat. Whew! That's enough.

"I wouldn't just drop it as a line of conversation out of nowhere, but on the topic of music most definitely! I admire and respect them just as well as any of the artists in my album collection. Quality music is quality music, and any judgement that someone else might have built on a preconception of BTS is on them. If they aren't interested in knowing why I respect BTS, no big deal. It's OK not to share the same interests as everyone else and if that style of music isn't their bag I'm sure there is something else would could talk about. :) If they show interest in why I admire them so much, I'll share that with them. It brings me a great deal of joy to listen to their music, so why not share that? In my eyes, I'm just trying to share something that brings a little shine to my life. If someone is curious enough and wants to find out that much about BTS, honey you know I'm your girl for it. Honestly, I'm proud of being a BTS fan and ARMY. I think the boys are bringing something uplifting to a weary world while also legitimately making history. It will be cool to look back on that years from now and know that you were in some small way a part of it all. As a lifelong fan of music it feels really exciting. My rule of thumb is, I am always willing to share those things that make me happiest in life with others, but only if invited.

"If you dig rapline, I would strongly suggest listening to those they've cited as inspirations for a good look at the foundation of their style. If you're a fan of chill, funky songs like Rain, Her, or 134340, check out Epik High (the new EP Sleepless in__________ is great!! highly recommend along with Remapping the Human Soul). J Cole also has a lot of touching songs that have that chill vibe (Change is the first one I can think of; the delivery and storytelling is amazing. Even his hits like No Role Modelz have a really strong message while maintaining a cooled-down vibe. The album 2014 Forest Hills Drive definitely inspired rapline.) 2pac songs such as Keep Ya Head Up, Changes, and Ghetto Gospel are awesome as well because of their story, and Namjoon especially seems to be inspired on some level by 2pac's flow. Of course, we can't forget about the king of chill rap, Drake. I'd recommend listening to Nothing Was The Same and Take Care for a good look at the music predebut rapline was listening to and learning from. Drake's flow and lyricism, while a little overhyped, is really moving and powerful. If you like some of their ""harder"" stuff, eg RM or the cyphers, the above artists are still worth listening to, but I'd also add Kendrick Lamar to the list. To Pimp A Butterfly is on the chiller side, while DAMN. is a little harder hitting. Kendrick, like the other artists on this list, is a master of telling a story and inspiring emotion through rap. This is in no way a comprehensive list of every single thing that inspired BTS's rapline, but I listed some artists I think are really great for exploring hip hop further than just BTS if that's what you're into!",0,1682,301

"People love the balls to the wall gritty/hyper-conceptualized stuff, and then they build their expectations around that. The S version pics from Answer is actually my favorite set of BTS concept photo's ever because of it's blatant themes, but honestly there's no need for that type of image to be recreated over and over again. What's the point? All these concept photo's need to do is portray the themes of the album, they're a visual companion to the style of songs we'll hear on the tracklist. And the lack of darker colors might be because that type of imagery doesn't belong on this album. If they're dressed up all pastel and colorful then they're telling you that's what you should expect of this album. ",0,712,124

"Sticking to K-Pop here since I only listen to a bit of J-Rock/Indie stuff (which is almost worlds apart) and occasionally stuff on the regular US/U.K. charts (which most people would probably already know) otherwise. üòÇ If you like their old ballads such as ÌïòÎ£®Îßå/Just One Day, Coffee, Ï¢ãÏïÑÏöî, etc. then I‚Äôd recommend; - Let Me by GOT7; this was composed by one of the members and has a very 00‚Äôs RnB/Hip-Hop vibe. - NCT‚Äôs Limitless EP - in particular, the tracks Angel, Back 2 U and ÎÇòÏÅú Ïßì. Angel definitely has a very similar sound and feel to ÌïòÎ£®Îßå in my opinion. If you liked Ma City, Am I Wrong and Ïó¨Í∏∞ Î¥ê/Look Here (not sure how to describe these but they definitely have the same fast-paced not-quite-jazzy-but-similar style), I‚Äôd recommend; - Shall We Dance by Block B - Show Me by KEY - Dramarama by Monsta X (a lot of their other discography is good if you liked Not Today but it‚Äôs a bit too heavy for me a lot of the time hahaha) ~~- EXO‚Äôs Tempo and Growl because I believe in inter-fandom and world peace.~~ If you liked Stigma and Singularity, I‚Äôd recommend; - Jonghyun‚Äôs She Is Album, in particular Orbit and Moon. Orbit has a very jazzy instrumental and Moon has a similar vibe due to Jonghyun‚Äôs vocals. - Jun.K‚Äôs discography - especially No Shadow, Mary Poppins and Mr No. - NCT U‚Äôs 7th Sense and Baby Don‚Äôt Stop. - TVXQ‚Äôs Something, Mirotic and Truth. I kinda wanna include Champagne too due to the vocals but I feel like that gives more of a J-Hope dance track vibe, especially with the rap verse. - Four Seasons by Taeyeon. Not usually a big fan of her music (it‚Äôs ‚Äògood‚Äô but kinda generic to me a lot of the time):but her latest single is really really catchy and well sung . If you liked their happy ‚Äòpop‚Äô tracks like Euphoria, I‚Äôd recommend; - ASTRO‚Äôs All Night album. Favourites are Moonwalk, 1 in a Million and Merry Go Round. (Moonwalk isn‚Äôt very similar Euphoria but it‚Äôs my favourite track from the album so I‚Äôm including it anyway.) Their old music has a similar happy style but is the instrumentals are more similar to what you‚Äôd get for softer rock music than pop. - JJ Project‚Äôs On&amp;On and Find You. - A lot of SHINee‚Äôs more recent discography, especially songs such as ÏÖÄ Ïàò ÏóÜÏñ¥/Countless, Chemistry and Îç∞Î¶¨Îü¨ Í∞Ä (no clue what the English title for that one is). Chemistry kinda borderline reminds me of BST for some reason too. - Print by HOTSHOT - Home by SEVENTEEN If you‚Äôre a fan of their faster hip-hop/rap based tracks (e.g. Mic Drop, Î±ÅÏÉà/Silver Spoon, No More Dream, the Cyphers, etc.), I‚Äôd recommend; - MINO‚Äôs solo album, especially Trigger. - ATEEZ‚Äôs discography, especially HALA HALA and Say My Name - Rewind by GOT7 - Stray Kids‚Äô I Am Who album, especially Question and My Pace. A lot of their discography is focused on topics that BTS also touches on so I‚Äôd recommend them if you like BTS for that sort of reason. - Lay‚Äôs older solo stuff (although I‚Äôd be a bit careful since a lot of his stuff ventures into the type of lyrics you‚Äôd find in typical American hip-hop these days). Most of it is a mix of English and Chinese but he separated the two for his recent album (which has a more tropical sound).

I'm not even kidding, I don't know what it is but I've only seen pink, blue and green haired students in my Japanese classes. Anyway, I remember at the beginning of the year in my first lecture, we only had 40 ish students so my professor went around and asked what everyone's reasoning was for taking the course. Most said either Japanese media (including manga/anime/other tv shows/music), food or the culture in general. Surprisingly a lot of people were bold enough to say they took it because of manga/anime. In that class, however, when a person replied with anime/manga, my professor nodded and laughed it off casually. I guess it's common. My point is, it surprised me that everyone felt at ease saying their real reasons. Where as in my Korean classes, your almost an outcast if you mention BTS or the more popular groups (some people in my classes are ridiculously elitist.. aka, only the ""old generation groups have any talent"" and BTS is just a fad etc.) It's shocking the difference between the two classes actually now that I think about it.

"Agreed. I'm teaching myself Korean and I love the culture but it's not because of BTS. They started my passion-the first time I ever heard Korean was through their songs--but I fell in love with the language and people on my own time, in my own search and studying. I have no idea why but Korean just ""clicked"" with me and I've been hooked ever since. I've studied and learned other languages, and I've always been interested in other cultures. But Korean everything hit me and somehow it feels like home to me. I love my country, I love my culture, and I will never not be American; but there's something about South Korea that just feels right in my soul. It's a weird sensation and it's very hard to explain to others. I once looked up ""Why am I learning a language I'll never use?"" in Google because I wondered if somehow I was wasting my time on a pointless pursuit, despite getting joy out of it. I came across a forum post that asked that very question and the replies were what I needed. Countless people were encouraging the OP to keep going and that nothing is by chance, including your interests. People were saying they loved a certain culture or language only to live or do business with that culture years later into their careers or maybe they met and married someone from that country. So now when I get comments about my love for Korean things, I just think about how my passion will make sense one day. One thing I've learned over 28 years is that God always has great things planned for us where and when we least expect it.",0,1543,286
"That's true. What irks me the most is when people think I chose my Degree/Major due to being a BTS fan. Not that I'm learning Korean specifically, but that I chose to spend my an important part of my life doing Korean at University level (or any language) for a boy-group (or other form of entertainment). I know a lot of people who study Korean, Japanese etc purely for kpop/jpop (or Japanese for the manga/anima and Korean for the kdramas). Even I started learning Korean because of my interest in the music (the rap/r&amp;b side surprisingly), and I started out learning as a hobby. But soon realised more to the Korean culture, hence deciding to further my studies. Same goes for my Japanese language studies - I don't even watch anime/read mangas. Boasting about loving BTS, for me, is something I want to keep separate from my studies because BTS isn't the reason I started learning. Sure, they're a factor in what kept me motivated, but that's not the whole story. However, as soon as I tell someone in my university (who knows my degree) that I like kpop, they jump on the ""crazy obsessed fan"" bandwagon. And it doesn't help that when BBC (Radio 1 I think) did that documentary, they decided to put the interview of the girl who literally moved to South Korea for BTS despite not knowing the language. That documentary got shown in my Modern Korean History lecture and literally everyone laughed. I admire her for her passion and love for the boys and I'm more than sure she is a lovely person, but I think moving to another country purely for a boy-group is too much. ",0,1577,282

"[  Here's an excerpt from the link: **The Birth of Tragedy** **Summary** Artistic creation depends on a tension between two opposing forces, which Nietzsche terms the ‚ÄúApollonian‚Äù and the ‚ÄúDionysian.‚Äù Apollo is the Greek god of light and reason, and Nietzsche identifies the Apollonian as a life- and form-giving force, characterized by measured restraint and detachment, which reinforces a strong sense of self. Dionysus is the Greek god of wine and music, and Nietzsche identifies the Dionysian as a frenzy of self-forgetting in which the self gives way to a primal unity where individuals are at one with others and with nature. Both the Apollonian and the Dionysian are necessary in the creation of art. Without the Apollonian, the Dionysian lacks the form and structure to make a coherent piece of art, and without the Dionysian, the Apollonian lacks the necessary vitality and passion. Although they are diametrically opposed, they are also intimately intertwined. Nietzsche suggests that the people of ancient Greece were unusually sensitive and susceptible to suffering and that they refined the Apollonian aspect of their nature to ward off suffering. The primal unity of the Dionysian brings us into direct apprehension of the suffering that lies at the heart of all life. By contrast, the Apollonian is associated with images and dreams, and hence with appearances. Greek art is so beautiful precisely because the Greeks relied on the appearances generated by images and dreams to shield themselves from the reality of suffering. The early, Doric period of Greek art is dull and prim because the Apollonian influence too heavily outweighs the Dionysian. The Greek tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles, which Nietzsche considers to be among humankind‚Äôs greatest accomplishments, achieve their sublime effects by taming Dionysian passions by means of the Apollonian. Greek tragedy evolved out of religious rituals featuring a chorus of singers and dancers, and it achieved its distinctive shape when two or more actors stood apart from the chorus as tragic actors. The chorus of a Greek tragedy is not the ‚Äúideal spectator,‚Äù as some scholars believe, but rather the representation of the primal unity achieved through the Dionysian. By witnessing the fall of a tragic hero, we witness the death of the individual, who is absorbed back into the Dionysian primal unity. Because the Apollonian impulses of the Greek tragedians give form to the Dionysian rituals of music and dance, the death of the hero is not a negative, destructive act but rather a positive, creative affirmation of life through art.",0,2609,417

"As I get older, I care less and less about what others think about my hobbies and interests. I've just started to feel like it's ridiculous for me to feel self-conscious about things that bring me such genuine joy and happiness. And BTS is no exception. I've only been ARMY since November but I've been pretty open about how much I love them with the people around me. I have gotten some of the typical reactions you would expect, and I just shrug it off. It's funny because I'm the kind of person who spends way too much time worrying about what other people think of me, to the point of social anxiety, but this particular aspect is one that genuinely doesn't bother me now. Growing up, I never ""grew out"" of things that most people think a guy should grow out of, like collecting action figures, watching animated shows, and playing a lot of video games. On top of that, I used to be self conscious about my music taste as well, because pop music gets looked down on a lot if you're a guy. Not to mention how I tend to pick female characters in video games way more often than the male ones. So I guess I've just had a lot of experience defending my hobbies. After a point you just get tired of feeling ashamed of those things.",0,1230,232

I tried introducing BTS to a couple of other casual friends (a girl and a guy) but they already had this pre-conceived idea that their fans are psycho because of the Burn The Stage chaos, so their judgemental reactions to the boys, my taste in music and guys mostly angered me and it's safe to say we don't hangout anymore.

"since DNA every comeback was a rollercoaster :( No offense to Bighit and their work but this sort of concept is overused and seems to be lazy. Since the concept is :Map of the soul : Persona I thought they would utilize different camera angles and mirrors to showcase each members different personas. For example lets imagine a concept photo with RM. He is standing in the middle of a room full of mirrors and wears typical idol flashy clothes. But he is surrounded by 20 different mirror reflections and each reflection shows a bit of his persona. Lets say one reflection shows Namjoon as a hardcore rapper, the other one shows a vulnerable Namjoon who is trying to find himself, the other is a proud Leader of BTS.

"In terms of today's concept photos, I'll repost what I wrote here: &gt;I'm wondering what the aesthetics could mean thematically? Being at home and being yourself without pretense? Being comfortable with yourself. &gt; &gt;Anyways, I'm loving the difference between these jammies and those naughty BST ones. Whereas the BST pajamas were silken, expensive-looking and represented sensuality and excess, these Persona concept ones are just comfy. I love it! The other concept photos seem to have to do with simultaneously recognizing and reconciling different ""images"" (see: versions) of ourselves so that we can know ourselves well. That's what I took from the different cameras, visual depictions of happiness, the film stills of the group and each member, etc. That's my best guess at the moment. Musically, I think they'll incorporate a lot of their past genre concepts. Getting to know the different facets of the group, how all these different sides are good, important, and equally a part of them, could serve as a reflection of how we should get to know each of ourselves. For instance, don't throw away the past, but treasure and learn from it. This includes the mistakes and the missteps. Each moment was intrinsic in making you who you are now, yet it doesn't wholly define or limit you because your present and your future and who you will become in those moments are equally intrinsic to your identity. I think that kind of concept, while of course psychologically interesting, can help a lot of people reach a place of peace with themselves. And, as a lot of people have said, I would love heavier hip hop elements, as well as the subtle rock elements we got from Skool Luv Affair and Dark &amp; Wild. I also think we'll get a lot of contrasts, both musically, thematically, and aesthetically. It'll be artistically fun for them to do so, but it will also be a good callback to the concept (we as people are complex and multi-faceted, made up of seeming contrasts). I'm just really excited, guys.",0,2008,340

"Answer wasn't even slightly similar though...There are thematic ties but that's pretty much it. Visually they have almost nothing in common. In fact these pics expand on that theme in quite a satisfying way in my opinion. Answer versions S and E may have been visually more interesting, but I think these pics actually have more to say between the lines than those did. With that it was basically just ""look cameras and eyes you GET IT PEOPLE ARE WATCHING US. Look we're marionettes and in bubbles GET IT WE'RE ISOLATED AND CONTROLLED BY OTHERS."" The execution is better, I agree, but when you think about it its also pretty literal and not that deep. And don't forget that those set of concept pics had some of the worst duds of the bunch, versions L and F are just phoned in pics of them in uniforms. These pics make me think a lot more and I think also a lot more consistent, I like them all. The pics here are much more simple but personally they resonate with me much more on an emotional level. Like, them getting ready and putting on their earrings and doing their hair is super evocative of what all of us do every morning to put on our ""personas."" That set of pics in particular is relatable and emotional in a way Ive never seen from them before. I also think that Bts ARE pushing boundaries here, and even if they didn't they don't need to. These pics are.....well to put in bluntly.....really gay, and REALLY feminine. I get that people want them to like....crossdress and go all out if they're gonna do that, but that wouldn't fit the theme. Campy and big would have been cool but it also would have been a poor interpretation of what they're trying to say. Again, just them getting ready in morning gets across that core idea better than an elaborate set and costumes ever could. I also actually don't think that Bts has ever been about pushing boundaries, their goal is to express themselves and make what they want to make, and often coincidentally they end up pushing boundaries in service of that.

"&gt; \*I just read some comments from the concept pics thread and I‚Äôm overwhelmed by how people aren‚Äôt seeing how concept 3 is a dollhouse.

This whole dollhouse concept kinda reminds me of Fake Love. I know the song is more geared toward a romantic interest, but almost seems to fit with people trying to control them, tell them what to do/what not to do, etc. &gt;""For you I could pretend like I was happy when I was sad. For you I could pretend like I was strong when I was hurt."" &gt; &gt;""Love you so bad, love you so bad. Mold a pretty lie for you. Love it's so mad, love it's so mad. Try to erase myself and make me your doll."" Maybe they are moving beyond relationships and are going to speak more on society as a whole? Like not just on how to love yourself, but actual criticism? Just a thought. &gt; The strawberry difference for 2seok from the rest of the group who‚Äôs holding up grapes is intriguing. I mentioned a theory in my other post on the concept photo thread about this but not sure if you've seen it. I'll post it again here: **So in regard to the strawberries and grapes in the 4th concept photos, there's this quote by Paracelsus which was in the introduction to the book ""The Art of Loving"" available on BigHit's website.** &gt;**‚ÄúHe who knows nothing, loves nothing. He who can do nothing understands nothing. He who understands nothing is worthless. But he who understands also loves, notices, sees ‚Ä¶ The more knowledge is inherent in a thing, the greater the love.‚Ä¶ Anyone who imagines that all fruits ripen at the same time as the strawberries knows nothing about grapes.‚Äù** Maybe BigHit just threw it in there to mess with us, but maybe it means something deeper. ~~2seok subunit.~~ &gt; The album covers seem to be tying into LY, we‚Äôve moved on from that era and this era is connected but is also supposed to be new, so I don‚Äôt know why they went so similar. I noticed that as well. Like I mentioned, they seem to be expanding on how people view them and how they view themselves. In a way, all the albums connect in the sense that they are detailing the journey through adolescence into adulthood. I'm guessing that this new album will refer back to their previous eras (we already got that through the Persona intro) in some way so I wouldn't be surprised if we got hip hop Bangtan again. Like you, I'm hoping that it's not too close, sound-wise, to the LY era since the album art seems to suggest that. Guess we'll see what happens. ",0,2808,518

"Ok, so what, in your eyes, was Bts and Bighit doing right before as opposed to ""nowadays?"" What's changed? Because in my eyes, production value and creativity have only gone up. Did you have these same issues with BST and Spring Day comeback pics? By your metrics, one of those was just them looking sultry in various dark sets and another was just them covered in paint. Not exactly ""original."" BST concept pics are my favorites they've ever done but they aren't exactly boundary pushing or special either. It's pretty basic ""dark and gothic"" stuff. Again, I think you're limiting yourself by looking at surface level details. You can draw a line between almost anything if ""holding a flower"" is your standard for things being derivative. I've NEVER seen a group do this kind of ""Ken doll in a box"" aesthetic they're doing in Version 3, for example. Especially a boy group. It's boundary pushing precisely BECAUSE it comes off as plastic and shallow, that's the point. It's the same thing I loves about Version S of Answer, it's saying ""Don't like it? Feel uncomfy? Think about why that is."" From a purely artistic perspective these pics are fascinating. The pastel aesthetic and set design, how two dimensional and dollhouse like everything feels....creativity is bursting from the seams here. Minimalism doesn't equal bad. Often the most cluttered, high concept stuff is the most unoriginal, imo. And again, sorry to keep harping on and continuing this line of text, but I truly think that no one would be saying anything if these pics were traditionally masculine. Everyone shit themselves over Tear pics because they were masculine even if they were the most boring. Its perceived as shallow because feminity is infantalized and treated as lesser.

It really will be the culmination and step forward of the Love Yourself series. Since it‚Äôs most likely going to be a series, Persona might talk about them accepting their idol-selves? Like what RM raps about in the comeback trailer, how he is all the personas that he and everyone else makes of him, and how he has come to accept that it is part of who he is. I‚Äôm assuming the other 2 albums will focus more on the other layers in the theory. The concept photos might not really suit the hip hop vibe of the trailer but it does suit the Persona album theme. If you look at all versions of the photos, they‚Äôre very bright, colorful, and gaudy. Much like what you do when you put on a mask/persona: you make yourself look happy and unbothered. Granted this doesn‚Äôt mean they are faking the smiles, I just think the concept photos are showing off their idol side more than anything else. I would love to have hip hop take a forefront in this album mostly because it‚Äôs been so long since their last big hip hop album. But also, add a couple pop or vocal focused song for the vocal line as well? I think BTS does pretty good in allowing all their members and their unique styles to shine so whatever is released I will accept with much love. (: ",0,1406,263

"I‚Äôm curious as to why Yoongi and Jin, our eternal roommates have slippers on whilst the others dot in the concept 4 pics, it makes it seems like it‚Äôs their home/room the others have visited. Then there‚Äôs also the strawberry difference for 2seok from the rest of the group who‚Äôs holding up grapes. The album covers seem to be tying into LY, we‚Äôve moved on from that era and this era is connected but is also supposed to be new, so I don‚Äôt know why they went so similar. Last time with Answer, none of the concept pictures even hinted at Idol, their look for it, concept and song iirc, so I don‚Äôt think these new concept pictures mean they won‚Äôt have a more hip hop style title track, lol actually the fact that the cb trailer was that way is what makes me think we‚Äôll be deprived of a hip hop title track. I really want the new eras album to be free creatively from the LY era, be musically open more like D&amp;W and Wings, so still holding out hope for that.",0,959,184

"As much as that sounds amazing, I don‚Äôt think BTS is looking to make hit songs so much as they want to get a message out to the public.

"Well i think a lot of people are reaching anyway to pull these into the Persona theme when they've done this kind of stuff a million times. I've seen Joon hold a flower to his face in that exact same way at least 5 times (one was for LY:Her concept). And the Greek God theme is obviously part of what they're going for but they didn't commit past having the members eat fruit and lounge around on a light colored set. I'm sure someone could connect the boys wearing dramatic dresses somehow. Putting on an elaborate costume = Persona. If we're going to applaud them wearing slightly elaborate jewelry and more effeminate clothes, then why not go all in? But overall, that's my biggest problem with bighit these days. They never seem to fully delve deep into anything for concepts. They skim the surface while still giving fanservice as their highest priority. That's what I think a lot of fans' problems with the more effeminate styling is - at least that's my problem. I think it's fanservice to appeal to younger fans or fans who want the members to look 'pretty' as opposed to being really daring and trying to say something. I love when BTS is daring and pushes the envelope, but these days the only really daring part is in their music not in their image.",0,1260,228

What do we need to learn after we learn how to love ourselves? A lot of people say that you can begin to love others, but what happens if you keep it introspective? I‚Äôve been stuck on that for a while. The idea of which self is great. I really hope that is the direction they‚Äôre going in. I have a lot of faith in their message and the direction BTS has taken over the years so I‚Äôm not really worried. ",0,538,105
"But the concept is ""persona"" or how they are perceived. Would a big elaborate Elizabethan concept really match that? And I personally don't think Bts has done this before, at least not like this. They haven't ever leaned into this dollhouse, pastel Wes Anderson look. They've used stuff like flowers before but those are just surface level props, EVERYTHING is derivative if you look at just that stuff. I also struggle to see people comparing these negatively to the Tear concept pics. Like.....one version of that was just them in denim in a white room and two others were just them in school uniforms. I don't think those were bad either, but if you had to call something lazy and derivative....those would definitely be it. These are spectacular in comparison, imo. All I'm saying is that people wouldn't be talking about this if they were masculine concepts. If they were styled like the we're in Tear, even if it was almost identical, people would still be raving about it. It's only a problem if it's feminine. ",0,1018,176

"I've looked at the 4 concepts, and maybe I'm just an over-thinker at this point, but I thought all 4 versions had stories to tell. Version 1 is selfie mania. Vanity/ego. Selfies, IMO, are egotistical...everyone wants to look good in a selfie. Everyone tries different faces when taking a selfie. I'm guilty of the same lol Version 2 is BTS being goofy with their friends, getting ready for an event, everyone putting on earrings or styling their hair. It's very ""Look at me!"" Version 3 is like Barbie World. Everything is bright, simple, soft. No sharp edges. Everyone is cute and shy and romantic. This version is the most idol-like of all. Version 4 is darker, more grown up, sensual. The colours are sharper, louder, less in sync with all the different patterns on the sweaters, the hot pink pants and loafers, the big costume jewelry etc. It's very flashy...almost bordering on tacky. But it's also showing them lounging about with an IDAF vibe. It's very indulgent, from the outfits to the fruits, to the bedroom eyes. All 4 versions show different facets of BTS...of every person, really. We all have ""faces"" we show to the world. Not necessarily pretending, but most people always want to show their best side, sometimes according to the people they are with. We don't show the same face when with co-workers vs. with friends. It's the same with BTS. There's been many discussions about how we don't truly know them beyond what they show us, and we don't have the right to know, tbh. But what if these photos are them showing us they can be vain and superficial? That they can be like many 20-somethings who like to party and look good all the time? That they can also be romantic and dreamy and sweet? And that they can seduce you with just one look? We've watched them grow over the years, but this is the first time I've felt they're truly owning the concept. The photos may be too simple for some, but to me, there is so much more to analyze and look at since LY era when BTS started sharing their journey to loving themselves. The question ""Who the hell am I?"" is all over these photos. I think it's the true concept. You can learn to love yourself, but which self? Can you love all of you? ",0,2203,398
I understand where you're coming from but i don't completely agree. I don't mind high style and taking stylistic risks in any form but unfortunately that's not what bighit is doing here imo. I do consider these safe and boring bc bighit has done all these before. I've seen them pose in gucci and with flowers on flat sets many times before. I think the amount of stuff they could do is endless- imagine them going full Young Thug in Elizabethan dresses or something. Or going full camp into the greek god theme with robes and sumptuous sets. Now *that*would be really pushing boundaries and doing something truly interesting,0,625,109

"I honestly hoped for another independent album like Dark &amp; Wild or Wings. I feel like these huge multi-album concepts are just limiting their creative freedom and possibilities. With how many western artists want collabs, couldn't they just make an independent album where they just try to make as many hits as possible with international collabs like Zedd, Shawn Mendes, etc. and just go full mainstream. I wonder how this Persona era will be, and if it will finally maybe also answer questions from the BU (if they still plan on answering the questions from here, because at this point it seems more complicated than the plot of Game Of Thrones). All I really care about at this point is if they make good songs that actually have hit potential. ",0,752,130

"I agree in terms of Jin's likely having old-fashioned values in some ways. He's shown chivalry in several instances, mentions his mom, continued his higher education like a good son, and is not as expressive with his inner thoughts and emotions as other members or young people. Or rather, those he chooses to display are the more ""positive"" ones. He's also been referred to as ""Manners Idol"" by the Korean public for some time, as well as ""Nation's Son-In-Law."" His clothing choices, like the simple Thom Browne ensembles, also indicate a more structured, old-fashioned values system (though he does leave on price-tags to be hip-hop). My point is that his style of dress is more reserved than someone like Tae, Hobi, or Jimin, and he genuinely felt shy when he was made to wear a top with a sheer insert across his upper chest. I obviously don't know Jin personally, and since he's a bit more reserved, that also can make him harder to figure out, so I may be way off base. But like you, I have also felt like Jin is a little more traditional and not as open as many members of the younger generation.",0,1103,198

"So I was doing some brief research on the theory of personality from Carl Jung and how it ties in to these photo concepts/album theme and I think I sort of understand? So the first theory is self and deals with our own identity (2nd concept), which is represented through each member looking at themselves in the mirror introspectively. Second is persona, which is the phony self that we show to others/public (1st concept), which is shown through camera selfies and premeditated poses. Third is anima, which is defined by the feminine side of men. The 3rd concept pics show that side using the roses, and it also looks like they‚Äôre in a bedroom so maybe it can also mean intimacy? Fourth is shadow, which portrays the cruel side of us containing animalistic urges and feelings of inferiority. The 4th concept pictures literally shows their shadow reflecting against the walls and they‚Äôre seen eating fruit (forbidden fruit representing the urges?). This is just my wild guess.",0,977,166

He who can do nothing understands nothing. He who understands nothing is worthless.

"Biiiissssshhhhhhh........the symbolisms! Most especially, the GRAPE symbolism! GRAPES (in the greek mythos) symbolize WEALTH, POWER, VICTORY, HAPPINESS. But there is also a connection to a god called Dionysus, who is the god of wine (and funny enough a recurring motif in GUCCI, which is the band's brand of choice). Dionysus is not just the god of wine, but of harvest, fertility, and madness, ecstacy and theater (or flambouyance). He is visually depicted as a god with man with womanly features. Grapes...when taken with a human subject, symbolizes birth or rebirth. So does this mean they are giving rebirth to their true selves? Or giving birth to a new era that we will have to explore ourselves into? Also, Dionysus is also called Eleutherios, meaning ‚Äúthe liberator,‚Äù because his wine, music, and ecstatic dance freed his believers from restraints from society, therefore reveling in their true selves. So my only (art history amateur) conclusion, is this new concept photos depicts Freedom, revealing their true selves or living life authentically and happily. Ugh, so much and that is on ONE FRUIT!

"It's guaranteed someone will always be unhappy with their photos, it happens every time, they can't please everyone. Everyone has a style they prefer. If they like their more risky concepts, they will feel a bit underwhelmed by the simple ones. And the ones who prefer it simple might roll their eyes at the weird, dark and edgy concepts. But in the end, they are just photos and people will be buying the albums anyway. We will likely never look at these photos ever again until the album arrives and we open the photobook then close it again to store it away. So if someone says they don't like the photos, that's alright. We don't have to like everything. Last time, version S and E got a lot of bad reactions from the korean side, didn't they?

"I think it‚Äôs a matter of scale. Super Bowl performances are much more of a make or break than any award show. Americans can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but isn‚Äôt it the most watched event of the year? And people expect to see their absolute favorites performing for the half time show. BTS would be getting extremely harsh criticism from the moment they were announced. I just don‚Äôt feel like the audience would appreciate them at all and tbh, it would hurt their popularity more than it would help because it‚Äôd be a full week of memes and hating on social media; people love to hate what‚Äôs popular to hate. Non fans who might‚Äôve given them a chance could just go ‚Äònah‚Äô from that point on. Not to mention the risk of performance issues - bad mic, back track issues, choreo mistakes from bg dancers, prop issues, someone‚Äôs sick and doesn‚Äôt sound good, someone‚Äôs injured and can‚Äôt dance/perform, yadda yadda yadda.

"ENFP here and I have no friends, associative or close. Some days it's not bad but every so often I get hit with the reality of it and it hurts. I just wait it out until the next day. If he's serious, there may be quite a few factors at play here: 1. He's an introvert *and* also shy. It's like a double-whammy. Makes it hard for him to put himself out there and meet new people. 2. He seems more conservative than the others. I mean, I could be completely off base here but he seems more reserved in demeanor, like he was raised or chose at a young age to behave a certain way: more polite, doesn't make the wrong move, etc. He's got a strong sense of old-fashioned values in him, a layer of etiquette that resides under the surface of his behavior. I believe this is one of the reasons why many fans (whether they know it or not) love him so much. He has this lovely mix of being silly and free and yet regal at the same time. However, these traits can make finding friends his age difficult as our generation doesn't tend to uphold those types of values, instead putting value on expression, independence, and pushing boundaries. It also makes it difficult to know what you (as a person) can of can't do. 3. Age. We have to remember that Jin is 26. This isn't old by any means BUT many people our age are settling down and having kids. It's hard to meet other singles because we now have to factor in each others' work schedule, personal plans, and their/our time with other relationships. For Jin especially this has to make keeping in contact with any same-age friends difficult as he might have the only free moment in a week but his friends are all busy. I'm not sure how it is in SK but in the South (at least my side of it) it's pretty common for people my age to be married with kids or at least married. Finding friends sometimes feels like finding a needle in a haystack. Anyway, he may just be joking with us but if he's being serious then I've listed why it could be. None of these things are bad, and I don't believe he should change anything about himself to please others. He's still very young, handsome, and above all, really sweet and a cool guy. He has plenty of time to meet people who he can connect with at a later time. Jin, if you're reading this: you're fine--just keep being you. You are a Bentley in a world of Kias. Everyone wants you, but very few have the bravery to test-drive you, and only a select few can afford to keep you. You are a rare treasure in this world and not everyone is going to understand your worth. Don't ruin yourself to look and be like everyone else--your Creator designed you just as you should be. Just keep being Kim Seokjin from Gwacheon. Accept your name and accept it's meaning. Everything will work out for you, I promise. üíú",0,2785,528

" I am like that myself. I am very social when required and have enough friends but hardly very many ‚Äòbest friends‚Äô. The only best friend is a best friend because she always makes effort with me which encourages to make me effort. It‚Äôs mainly because I am very outgoing and friendly when I am with people but I never feel the need to ‚Äòtalk to friends‚Äô when I am alone. I prefer to keep my problems to myself as well and rarely seek advise or feel the need to confide in people unless it‚Äôs happened organically if we are catching up and the topic comes up. I feel Jin might be similar (which is probably why I relate to him), he has time and again talked about how he doesn‚Äôt talk about his problems or confides in his members. It also seems like other members such as jk/Jimin seek him out first to socialise such as having dinner in his roomotherwise he is happy doing his own thing. He also mentions in LY Seoul DVD how other members confide in him since he is easy to talk to but he doesn‚Äôt talk about his problems unless it‚Äôs huge.

"Frankly, as long as it's not a cutesy, bubbly concept (not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just not my thing. Nor do I think that's in the realm of this album), I'll be happy no matter what. I would definitely prefer some more old school stuff. Not necessarily hip hop, though that'd be cool, but less poppy (if that makes sense). Have the rappers do old school hip hop, and the vocalists do stuff similar to GOT7's ""If You Do"", which to me gives off an 80's vibe (the darker, not Madonna side). I feel like that would mix with the old school hip hop well to have a variety of song types without straying from the central tone/theme. I'd prefer that at least a few songs aren't hip hop, so I think a mix would be good.",0,730,140

"The super bowl question/item has come up a few times and the arguments against them performing always seem to boil down to two points: 1. This is an American event, so an American should perform with American music. 2. Super bowl fans are racist and would hate them and it would be horrible etc... My feeling is this - on point one, American identity has always been fluid, with the capability of individuals to continually question what indeed might make an American event American. Likewise American music spans a wide expanse of sound, culture and audiences. BTS's music has been played at sports events now for the past 2 years, they have performed at American awards shows and in US Arenas and will now perform in stadiums. The music might sound different, but that's okay to because what exactly is American music supposed to sound like? Point 2 - When BTS was first invited to the Billboards and there was discussions of them performing, many people on this forum and twitter said they were glad BTS would not be because of the hatred and racism in the US. These racist people exist but fear that they would destroy BTS somehow did not happen. I don't think it would happen if they performed at the Super bowl either. I don't see this come up in the Super bowl discussions very often - but why do we as Army/fans feel that BTS should limit themselves because people will say things? They have had horrible horrible things said to them already, and we can all see how strong they are. They also have immense support from the US television media. If BTS became the subject of racist feedback after *any* show at this point, we as fans would just need to tweet some talkshow hosts (you know who) and it would be news. I didn't mean to throw this all on you- so sorry! It's just every time the Super bowl comes up I think about this. &amp;#x200B;",0,1849,335

Frankly, considering they weren't meant to be dolls of the actual BTS members irl, but based on how they looked in the Idol m/v, they didn't actually turn out *too* bad. I will say that Mattel seems to have run out of gas, so to say, halfway thru the set. What I mean is that for V, Jin, JK, and J-Hope, the dolls weren't *too* far off.

"My biases are the three members of BTS that consistently surprise me and that's JHope, Jimin, and Suga in no particular order. JHope's personality comes out here and there and I'm still putting all the pieces together. He's serious, hard working, has bounds of energy, and just puts forth this cool vibe that goes deep into his bones. It's totally at odds with the variety show version of himself. I just want to know more about him and I can't look away from him whenever he's on stage. Jimin I just refer to mentally as an angel. He's so lovely - lovely is the best word I can use to describe him. The way he moves, his face, and his personality are just so effortlessly sweet and captivating. I can never not notice Jimin and that's so powerful. He was definitely born to be stared at on stage and he just glows in front of other people. Did I mention he's literally beautiful inside and out? And then Suga... where to even begin. He's one of those people that when they talk you shut up and listen. Nothing frivolous ever comes out his mouth. He's insightful, brilliant, and deeply compassionate and it comes across in his work. I identify the most with him because I'm a pretty reflectively person, I love expressing my opinions and have a nack for seeing the bigger picture. Suga appearance is oddly porcelain doll like, which is a direct contradiction to his rapper from Daegu persona. His face and body is thin like a cat and he's very pretty yet so imposing. He's just great and he conveys his thoughts clearly and effectively every time. I really do find him fascinating. So yeah I don't think I could choose between these three - they all tie for my number #1 bias spot. Number two would be Jin and Namjoon and number three would be Jungkook and V. Not that I don't utterly adore every single one of them, but Jimin, JHope and Suga just make me feel some type of way when I see them or hear them talk. ",0,1913,354

People like that give energy to other people but have to come by their own energy organically. So when he's down, he's really upset.

"Yoongi, and I don't really have any bias wreckers lol, even though they all cause me pain. Not because I don't adore the other men but because Yoongi has just messed me up, and then when life was the one to mess me up Yoongi was one of the major factors that helped me put my life back together again. Taehyung was my initial bias for mostly superficial reasons (I mean, he really stands out in ""Boy in Luv"" amiright?), his energy, and his gritty, grungy, deep voice. I fell in love more when I learned about the boys' personalities on AHL, but that was also when I started to notice Yoongi but it wasn't until their next comeback that he devastated me like a ton of bricks. At first I was mostly curious and intrigued about what makes him tick; he simultaneously is subdued while exuding so much charisma. I distinctly remember watching the dance practice for ""Danger,"" Yoongi's legs gleaming brighter than my future and thinking, ""Just who is he? He's fantastic but seems understated? Is that by choice? He seems like such a thinker...does he write?"" Little did I know... Anyway, as an introvert, I could relate, and when I found out that he was also caring and an artistic visionary, I was hooked. Even before he dropped the mixtape that shook the world, his lyrics in ""Intro: the Most Beautiful Moment in Life"" and ""Nevermind"" resonated with me so deeply and a moment in my life when I was extremely indecisive, anxious about my future, and felt like I was a hollow person without a dream (you can see why BTS hooked me in general--I was first year in college during the Boy in Luv era). I didn't even realize he had become my new bias until the point where it was undeniable and I couldn't look back (still have such a soft spot for Tae though). Everything after that just solidified his position in my heart and don't even get me started on how I felt when he dropped AGUST D.",0,1882,346

They just seem to enhance his strong, royal features without it looking like he‚Äôs trying too much. His hair looks nice in many colors, whether blonde or just darker than pastel (especially if his clothes are darker). &amp;#x200B; **Jin:** [any expensive or pretty versions of regal colors‚Ä¶](  Whether it‚Äôs pink, red, or violet, they just highlight his beauty. I think they let his face shine as the center of attention, and highlight the color of his cheeks and lips. Effortlessly like a prince. &amp;#x200B; **Yoongi:** [rich, deep versions of whatever color &amp; black](  He hasn't met a hair color he didn't agree with, but I think deep, warm colors (red, hot damn) are best ‚Äòcause his natural features and coloring are so high-contrast. For instance, he‚Äôs great as a platinum blonde, but works a rich, saturated blonde even better. &amp;#x200B; **Hoseok:** [warm reds and browns. maybe autumn or earthy colors in general.](  I just think warmer tones complement him so well. Earthy fall colors (and even green) too. They make him look very healthy, both intense and soft. &amp;#x200B; **Jimin:** [I totally agree with you on pastels.](  They really seem to complement his softness. Any light colors actually. When he has light or bleach blonde hair, his hair looks lighter, gives that ‚Äúangelic‚Äù effect that fits him. &amp;#x200B; **Taehyung**: [vibrant colors &amp; white](  He looks wonderful in everything like all the guys (obvi) but pastels wash him out a bit more I think.

Especially if it‚Äôs a pop of color matched with black and white. &amp;#x200B; **Jungkook:** [softer versions of bright, warm colors](  I think he looks so vibrant and youthful in soft oranges and yellows.

"I was genuinely impressed with this video. One of the guys has been following RM's career since he was Runch Randa and I thought it was really cool to get the perspective of someone who knew of RM from the beginning beginning especially since RM is discussing his persona and shadow. I did watch the DKTV? (if i spelled this wrong sorry) explanation and I generally liked it but I will say that I do agree with those who felt that he was looking at ""personas"" with a bit of negative point of view when it is just a facet of ourselves that we need to accept and understand. I really like how these guys picked up on everything so quickly and then relayed that information in a very easy to understand manner. A+ in my book (I also watched their Fake Love reaction after this and the guy, who knew RM since Runch Randa, says more about that in that video).",0,854,162

The other members were either shy or acted ridiculous (Which was super-entertaining. Yoongi cracked me up.) [  Jin also makes special efforts to include people in the fun during TV broadcasts when they're a bit left out: [  Jin's 24/7 kindness is really important to me.

"I love them. I'm not *in* love with them, but I still love them all dearly. Love comes in all shapes and sizes. Do I know them personally, or know exactly what they're like off-camera? Nope. They've only shown us glimpses of who they really are, but that's enough for me. I love them, and respect them, and admire them. I wish the very best for them. Their happiness genuinely makes me happy. That's love. It's not the same love I feel for my friends or family or partner(s), but it's still *a* love. Honestly, I think you're making a bigger deal out of it than than it actually is. First of all, they *want* us to love them. That's the nature of kpop. Hell, that's the nature of the entertainment industry, period, and the goal of anyone in it. They need to be loved to thrive in the business. Artists don't make it very far when they aren't. As for people lusting after them...what's wrong with that? Sexual humans beings are allowed to find other human beings sexually attractive, aren't they? I'm pretty sure Jungkook (for example) knew exactly what he was signing up for when he green-lit the shirt-lifting part of the Fake Love choreo. I'm sure Hoseok knows exactly what's going through our heads when he does his epic hip thrusts in Baepsae. The list goes on and on. There's one thing to sexually objectify someone--that is, to reduce them to being sexual objects only--and it's another thing entirely to be sexually attracted to someone. For the most part, fans tend to be in the latter category. Those who aren't...well, they get blocked, simple as that. ",0,1564,279

"Jin. I disliked him when I first saw him in Danger MV because he kind of looked like a typical shy flower boy, and looked sort of awkward when dancing (he is still 100000x more amazing than me). Then I watched a short 10min interview on ASC and his personality shook me. I think all of them made the impression that they were not shy or awkward in front of a camera, but Jin really stood out as he carried the flow of the interview. When I misjudge someone that badly I tend to fall for them straight after lol. Also, I always find the little moments whenever he is on-camera to be super entertaining because he is either embarrassing himself or the others. He truly blossomed after Fire/Young Forever came out and since then his constant barrage of hilariousness has kept me on the line.",0,788,146

I‚Äôm definitely not going against this, but I think it could be argued if it‚Äôs ethical or moral (despite bts validating the behavior) to ‚Äúuse‚Äù bts (or others) as an emotional crutch. Would we have the same view point on a relationship with someone personally close to us? Or a friendship? But them being a celebrity brings a whole other complex and dynamic relationship that can be explored. I‚Äôm not sure if you could ever be ethical with a celebrity because the position in of itself could be unethical and inhumanly impersonal? I think the relationship between a fan and celebrity is formerly unhealthy when you dissect it down to its barest form.

"&gt;I also would like to cover a topic of people utilizing BTS to get through a rough time in their life and abruptly distancing themselves/unstanning when they‚Äôre in a better point in their life. Could we say they‚Äôre using them in a sense for their own self gratification? Could people argue the validity of their being a fan, or could you argue that there is nothing wrong with utilizing them as a coping mechanism for a period of time. I'd argue this is something they are not only aware of, but validate. Namjoon has addressed it quite directly a number of times, such as in his now-famous [ment from The Wings Final](  &gt;Everyone that has acknowledged us, in everyone‚Äôs dreams or lives, our existence, music, pictures, videos, even if it‚Äôs just a little, let‚Äôs say the pain is at 100, if we could at least make it 99, or 98, then the value of us (being here) is enough. as well as the ment from [a Love Yourself concert](  where his message is pretty on the nose: ""Please use me, please use BTS to love yourselves."" After their emotional MAMA speeches at the end of last year, Jungkook also talked about something like this in a fancafe post. To paraphrase, he said even when we have ""let go of each others' hands"" ‚Äì basically not their fans anymore at some point in life ‚Äì they will be glad as long as they have been able to provide us some happiness, no matter how small. It's not uncommon for people to find and stan BTS at a point in their lives when they need some kind of emotional support, the sense of belonging in a fandom or just a momentary haven of good feelings their content provides. I used to feel guilty about using them as emotional first aid and spent a lot of time wondering what kind of a give-and-take relationship this actually is. A bit after that, Hope World was released and Hobi also made his perspective pretty clear in P.O.P pt 1. These are only a handful of examples, but to me it's obvious from the way they speak that they have a very clear understanding of how they are being ""used"", and even encourage us to siphon energy from them in this way, regardless of what we end up giving back or how quickly we may move on with our lives. Lately they have emphasized it even more; though it has always been kind of a part of their ethos since day 1, they have seemed to feel more responsibility about being a positive influence now that the audience responding to their ripple effect is considerably more massive. As long as we don't act entitled to their energy, demand more than they give, or rely on them in a way that crosses a line into unhealthy behavior (remember kids, kpop isn't a replacement for therapy), I wouldn't be too cynical about it and just take what they are willingly offering.",0,2732,503

"I think it becomes really hard to separate admiration from romantic feelings especially when one is in their teens and early adolescence. Atleast it was for me. I remember 3-4 years back (when I was 20) I started following a popular travel blogger on Instagram. I loved what he wrote. Over the next 3-4 days I went through his 4000 Instagram posts and concluded that he was what I wanted in a guy. He had gone through so many hardships to follow his dreams and had the ""underdog life"" backstory. I had a boyfriend yet there I was daydreaming about some random guy. I was convinced that he was the ideal guy for me and would really like me if we ever met(Where he lived was just 6-7 hrs drive from my city and I even tried planning a trip with my friends to go meet him). Eventually my fangirling and fantasies mellowed down ( because yeah college does that to youü§∑) but I still admired him and really wanted to meet him someday. A couple years later him and I happened to be in the same place for a couple of months and I decided to DM him. We hung out a dozen times and yeah no surprises, I didn't like him and I kinda hated him. I still follow him since he writes really well but yeah that's that. I am sure he's a good person even though he behaves like an entitled a**hole at times but yeah he was nothing like I imagined he would be through his writings and photos. My disappointment was obviously my fault too since I constructed this persona without even knowing the person. I realised there's a reason they say never meet your heroes. Had I not built expectations around his personality I am sure I would have liked him better. ",0,1636,309

"I think my bias is Jin after reading that 'cake analogy' below. &amp;#x200B; The first people that attracted me to BTS was Jungkook's singing with Charlie Puth followed by his Rainism dance cover. As a dancer myself, I loveeee watching good dances specially when they put in the perfect expressions to go along with it. So after that when I started watching their songs, BST, etc my eyes would always go to Jimin thanks to his expressions or sometimes V (war of hormone). At this point I was loving BTS but didn't have any bias or anything and I respected them all for their different talents. &amp;#x200B; I never even thought of 'stanning' because I am always only a 'casual fan' of entertainers, even in real world I don't have any people that I look up to or want to be like even though there are so many people I 'respect'. (Only time I 'stanned' someone before was a female Bollywood actress for a limited time.) &amp;#x200B; However, as I watched more and more of their content and listened to more of their B sides/solos (no videos so focussed on singing only), Jin's voice always made me feel emotional, oh and V's when he sings in his low range. I never even realised when Jin creeped up on me and instead of firmly looking at Jimin everytime, I started looking for Jin in videos. His personality had a huge part to play because initially I didn't get the hype about his looks. As much as I am a strong OT7 and really respect them all for their craft and attitudes, I don't think I could 'hang out' with a lot of them if they were just someone I knew unless both parties put in a lot of effort. However, I can imagine getting along with Jin like a house on fire. &amp;#x200B; I am ok with his dad jokes, I am impressed by his sassy humour, I love his serious side and how much he tries to be strong for people around him and never complains and I really, really respect his big, kind heart. He believes in working hard but rarely talks about how hard it is for him. He is kind and laid back but never a pushover. He knows how to get his point across or put people in their place if needed but he manages to do it without causing confrontation. He makes mistakes and goes overboard at times but always handles the aftermath well. He is self aware including his shortcomings but doesn't let that depress him and instead focuses on where he can improve. &amp;#x200B; I know many people who are successful, talented, intelligent, hard working or funny and confident but I rarely come across people who are all of that and on top of that kind without forgetting their roots.

"Totally, I think that‚Äôs a whole other thing to unpack. Utilizing BTS as a coping mechanism can be both healthy and unhealthy. (I also would like to cover a topic of people utilizing BTS to get through a rough time in their life and abruptly distancing themselves/unstanning when they‚Äôre in a better point in their life. Could we say they‚Äôre using them in a sense for their own self gratification? Could people argue the validity of their being a fan, or could you argue that there is nothing wrong with utilizing them as a coping mechanism for a period of time. I‚Äôm not sure myself. It‚Äôs a very complex topic.) But with hyper-sexualizing, I would assume that BTS are aware of the risk factors and these fantasies that are projected onto them.

"I think there‚Äôs really no way to find that perfect balance when you‚Äôre a public figure like BTS. They‚Äôre essentially selling a fantasy, especially when being in the idol market, which is hyper-fixated on selling a particular wide-spectrum fantasy to fans. There will be people who take that idealized fantasy (sexually or romantically) and project it onto BTS and those people (as harsh as it seems) could have a disconnect with reality in a sense. Kind of straying off topic slightly, in another sense, people also utilize BTS as a coping mechanism and this could also blur the line of blending their own fantasies onto BTS in order to disassociate from their reality as well. This can both be sexualized fantasies or it can be other fantasies related to what they‚Äôre not able to obtain from their own reality. It‚Äôs not always malicious. Realistically, there will always be a certain level of projection onto BTS no matter because we don‚Äôt know BTS intimately.

"Every idol's public persona is deliberately constructed to be the *ideal*, with enough gaps to project whatever you want in. That's their whole deal. Being there to be romantically projected on is literally their job, and what the companies capitalize on to keep the system running. So this phenomenon is kind of boosted and blatant with idols, but it happens in normal life as well. It's easy to fall in love with the idea of someone. I had a big crush on a gentle looking manbun-sporting oversized-offwhite-sweater-wearing uni acquaintance of mine and fantasized about napping with him in the evening sun talking about poetry or some shit ‚Äì until I actually got to know him and learnt he's an elitist asshole who despises art. I got to be on the other side of it too; there was a guy who knew me for a full year, was madly in love, yet made no attempt to actually get to know who I am. He gave me a nickname of a high-ranking military officer, because that's the kind of persona he wanted me to be and the projection he was actually in love with. So, it's a human thing. BTS are part of the idol system that capitalizes on it. They protect a more private side of themselves, as is healthy, while showing us some (presumably still genuine) sides they want to show. There's nothing wrong in being attracted to that. As long as you are aware of this dynamic, don't fall into the delusion that your projection is real, and treat actual people in your life with the respect they deserve for all their rough edges and flaws, it won't be harmful.",0,1541,281
"HOBI!!!! Look at him go, it's so cool of him to give like this! So inspiring. ",0,78,16
"As far as the members go, I think those silly comments are mostly harmless as long as the members have fulfilling personal and professional lives. They knew they‚Äôd be objectified to some degree as idols, but they do also mitigate that relationship with their own videos and messages. Also, the members tend to not say things that imply there‚Äôs any hope of a relationship with a fan. And Jin even tells fans to stop asking absurd things, like for marriage. I think saesangs and obsessives are an issue, but that‚Äôs not most fans. And honestly, that they have parts of themselves we don‚Äôt and can‚Äôt know is not a criticism. It‚Äôs the nature of life, because people are complicated and multifaceted. It‚Äôs healthy that BTS has their parts that are theirs alone, because that means they have identities and self-worth completely separate from us. They deserve that.",0,858,147

I don‚Äôt see anything wrong for seeing an idol in a sexual way (when it‚Äôs not done to an extreme) it‚Äôs kinda the same with women pining over Channing Tatum or any celebrity. Obviously idols only show what they want to show and are sometimes limited to a contractual degree but I don‚Äôt doubt that they show tiny glimpses of their personality or the things they are interested in. I don‚Äôt know tae personally but I do know that he enjoys and at times has purchased art, listens to classical music as well as a broad genre and I can appreciate that and know it‚Äôs a pretty genuine side of him because of how passionate he shows himself to be. But yes apart of them being idols and remaining single is that they‚Äôre built up that way to essentially be idealized and romanticized, the perfect boyfriend, not everyone can agree or feel that way but it is what the business model is built around, hence the non dating rules, no female idol interactions.

Namjoon is up there too like please don't get me started how admirable the man is. He carries a huge weight on his shoulders as the leader and translator for the group. And his musical abilities are on a league of their own. BTS is special to me because they all stand out as individuals. And with so many boys groups out there, for me it's rare to find group where I want to know about all the members individually and not just a bias. ",0,1070,212

"Since there are just so. many. superheros, I narrowed it down to BTS as X-Women. RM - Storm - Beautiful, Intelligent, Very powerful and in touch with nature. When she's given the chance to lead a team, she's an excellent leader who supports and challenges the people that she has to lead. She's diplomatic, regal and despite all the challenges and tragedies she's seen as a member of the X-men, she stays strong and helps other people work through it. She speaks several languages and very well could have decided to stay in Africa and be a weather Goddess but instead chose to help the world not just with her powers. She also takes fashion risks, which is appropriate. Jin - Wolfsbane - At first she was just a shy Wolf girl who had trouble opening up to people, but her time with the X-Force helped her open up and learn to trust people, have a little fun and be herself. Wolfsbane worked incredibly hard to help her team, to become an important member and to open up to the people around her which I think suits Jin really well. She also initially didn't believe in herself or her abilities but worked really hard to become the Wolfsbane who helps her team and cares about / is cared for by the people around her. Suga - X-23 - At first, X-23 seems like this silent yet beautiful killer devoid of much else but a beautiful face and some Wolvie claws. But in reality, she's kind of a goof that wants to help people, laughs a lot but is pretty scary when she wants to be. She also cares for the people around her so deeply that you can't always tell (like her Dad). She's powerful and she honed those skills by training really hard and overcoming her upbringing to become an awesome leader. As an aside, in the Logan movie, she fully pretended to not understand or speak English for like half the movie until it got to the point she had no choice. Jhope - Dazzler - At first glance, you might think I robbed Hobi here but Dazzler is awesome. She's a singing and dancing machine and her pyrotechnics may seem weak but that's just because she has an awesome amount of control over them. Despite readers kind of thinking she was a goofy, stupid mutant for a lot of years (Dazzler got clowned a lot), there's a reason the X-men have been courting Dazzler since the seventies. She can be a smiley, happy Disco Queen on stage but when its time to get things done she has no problem getting to buisness. Jimin - Pixie - Half human and half faerie, Pixie is beautiful, smol and very friendly. Initially people really liked Pixie, but her true powers came from her ability to protect the people she cared about without any worries about her own safety. She's super noble, really strong and despite some of the bad things that have happened to her as a member of the X-men she never leaves. And of course, she's a literal Faerie. V - Jubilee - Don't underestimate Jubilation Lee. She started out as a goofy, weird kid with firework powers and was commonly accused of being useless but through a lot of hard times she became an invaluble X-man. I mean that! She survived great loss, she's an amazing leader and despite being a Vampire now she doesn't let it hold her back at all and though she knows how to get serious she hasn't let life stamp out her youthful optimism and pursuit of justice. Also, I firmly believe that she eats Panda Express. Jungkook - Kitty Pryde - Shadowcat is the golden maknae of the X-men and always will be. She's really powerful, she's incredibly hardworking and she's not just a girl who pops through walls at all (and frankly has not been for decades). She's good at anything she tries, be it hand to hand combat, magic stuff, or traveling around space and leading a crew in cosmic MU shennanigans. Also, when she was recruited, she only joined the X-men because she looked up to Storm. Despite being the youngest X-man for a long time, she learned a lot from the older members and has become an amazing leader in her own right. Also she has a very cute little dragon. ",0,3991,734

"From my comment history, it's quite obvious to say that Kim Taehyung (V) is my ultimate bias. When I pick favorite members/bias of a certain group, it's usually who I think has the best voice or my favorite voice as a primary criteria along with whose stage presence attracts me the most as secondary criteria then personality comes in as optional or bonus points (to be honest, idols' first priority is promoting their talents/artistry, personality is much more of a marketing technique to attract fans to the group or even the idols themselves LOL!). In this case (in my opinion-I'm probably part of a devil's advocate sort of type lol), it's Taehyung (my favorite among the group (what makes it much more interesting is that he's the only lyric baritone vocalist in a tenor-majority vocal line and pop industry overall) and most appealing stage presence to me (his facial features LMFAO!)). Not only that, though we're quite different in terms of personality (nothing conflicting, more like Yin-Yang sort of thing), I relate to him the most out of all the group (along with Jungkook) and he reminds me a lot of my more extroverted-friends, especially my two best friends (he actually has exactly or almost exactly the same personality as my best friend before college!

"Jin. I don't have any bias-wreckers. As a parent and eldest sibling, I appreciate caretakers like Jin. In a video from years ago, Tae and Jimin were annoying the other members while they were trying to sleep. Every member except JK (the baby) told them to go away (which I'm perfectly fine with). Yet, Jin, the oldest, and who was actually asleep, woke up to Tae and Jimin messing around, looked at them sleepily, and smiled and showed that he was happy to see them. He let them play their game with him, and he smiled the whole time. He looked like a doting father who always has time for his kids, no matter what. When I saw this, I felt Jin must be a very kind person. Jin later impressed me with his singing in Crystal Snow. I had assumed his high notes were created in the studio because I thought nobody in the group could sing them. When I saw the live performance, I was shocked to see it was Jin. Jin also told Namjoon that he finds his happiness in making those around him happy through laughter and humor. That's why he acts so comedic. I also most prefer Jin's voice and songs like Epiphany, Autumn in Front of the Post Office, Awake, and the Japanese tracks he features on.

I love how his voice can be gangster-rap, but be totally sultry in the next verse. I admire how he is always visibly growing in maturity. He's one of the most natural English speakers in the industry too. I float between my #2 bias... Jin and V fight for it. üòÇ - Jin looks and sounds like a Disney prince. When he has something to say with conviction, it's so beautiful -- Epiphany, Autumn Post Office, most of his solo covers. I can't relate to him too much as he has a secretive persona as we all know, but I appreciate him anyway. I hope he gets featured in a drama someday since he initially wanted to act. - V's low bass voice always gets me (üòç) and Singularity is one of my all-time favorite songs now even outside of K-Pop. I resonate with how V has a different, unconventional way of doing things; I was always made fun of for not being a linear thinker so I know what it's like when no one takes you seriously because there's always this wall between you and the world.",0,1171,226

This is why she's my bias!!,0,27,6
"Imo, no catch right now, like most have stated in previous comments. Also the fact that the US has 3 stadium locations and each with 2 days, compared to the other countries with 1 location and 2 dates might be a factor in why there are still face value tickets available. Many ARMYs were expecting sales to be very similar to the last tour with scalpers getting way too many and bumping the prices sky high. So, if they were like me, they may have bought one or two tickets more than they needed just to be safe. Sometimes it was for a friend who may have decided to go with a different seat or was able to get one themselves. But I‚Äôm so glad to see that so many of us resold them to other ARMYs at cost. This time, I think the 2 different sales dates, no confirmed price list, and short notice also kept out and deterred scalpers (mostly from round 2) since there was an immediate decrease on day 1 resale prices right after day 2 was announced. So maybe some of this (in addition to other previous suggestions) is also way we see more lower prices than we saw last tour. ",0,1073,206

"Namjoon is my ult bias. My story is pretty typical I fell for his voice first when I heard him rap, he has an incredibly unique vocal color especially amongst idols. And as I became further acquainted with the group I began to realize how vastly encapsulating his mind is. He's one of the most evocative spoken people I had ever come across, and his mind is sort of just this rich inner world of ideas that he emotes perfectly through his music. Furthermore he's somebody that's just so easy to look up to, and his existence simply garners one's attention? Namjoon is this person who just wants to help and do right by people, he's so resolute in his morals and those goals that he won't let anyone stop him or tell him he can't. Sometimes when I look at him I can't help but think he's just this really cool guy who respects and loves everyone around him so openly, and that's just a good way to go about living your life.

Yoongi is my bias. I forget how he became my bias. It started out with Jungkook then JK and V. I think it was one of the Yoongi savage moments compilations on YouTube that brought me down a spiral of Yoongi clips. Each clip slowly made me fall in love with him more. I began to seek out his lyrics and his solo songs (AgustD) and I just think he is absolutely incredible. Taehyung is my bias wrecker for sure. His low voice does it in for me. ,0,443,88

I‚Äôve gone without meals before, bad for me, but it was hard to get out of the habit...

"When I discovered BTS, J-Hope instantly stood out to me. His intense passion for dance shone through in every MV and after 7 months of getting to know the boys, I‚Äôve found there is so much more to him than what‚Äôs on the surface. People tend to not look further than ‚Äúsunshine angel Hobi‚Äù, and miss out on a lot of his true duality. Like with Mang, most of what we see of Hoseok is a mask. He‚Äôs a performer, and he holds his true thoughts, personality, and interests close to his chest. A portion of the real Jung Hoseok shines through in his Hope World mixtape. Piece of Piece and Daydream especially. And I remember in the behind the scenes of Spring Day he mentions the blurring of the J-Hope character and Jung Hoseok, the performer. I relate to him in that way, working in customer service as an introvert is hella difficult. I have to force myself to be someone I‚Äôm not for a shift in order to make others feel more at ease. I remember one member saying that Hoseok gets tired easily when he has to be ‚Äòon‚Äô which I instantly recognized as minor social exhaustion. He can be cynical, lose his temper, think pessimistically. He gets zits, indigestion and gains weight. It‚Äôs these flaws and contradictions that attract me, because it‚Äôs so imperfect. As fans we tend to put these boys on pedestals, but I find it much easier to love a human than a god.",0,1353,251

Why you ask ? Because Firestorm is literally two people in one. Coincidentally, namjoon has talked about how he needs to differentiate between RM and Kim namjoon..two different people ! Suga- daredevil. Daredevil has a very strong and woke mindset and view in life that is really like yoongi, he also has a very good sense of humor. I was going to put yoongi as Hawkgirl just for the sass but I think daredevil is what I‚Äôm set on. Taehyung- Bart Allen aka kid flash aka impulse what ever you know him as. BART Allen is very charming and boyish and very taehyung..in a superficial way ! Tae was the hardest to think of a super hero for I blame the fact that‚Äôs it‚Äôs 3am and my brain isn‚Äôt working at all Jhope - starfire ! She‚Äôs outgoing and so positive and encapsulates jhopes agenda of spreading hope and joy ! Especially since she epitomizes the joy seeking aspect of tamaranean culture. she‚Äôs also very flamboyant!

"****Warning: Spoliers ahead!**** For Jin, I was thinking of Spiderman, especially the Tom Holland version. Spiderman, especially the Tom Holland one, has a sense of humor &gt;!(and you see in the Avengers Civil War movie when he‚Äôs the comic relief in the movie)!&lt; and a youthful vibe to him. With his dad jokes and his youthful energy even as the oldest of BTS, Jin is pretty quite fitting for Spiderman, especially the Tom Holland version. Maybe Captain Marvel (the female one, not the DC one) for his dry wit, sassiness, and rebelliousness-especially with the dad jokes, playful bickering, and JinHit entertainment joke (like in his Eat Jin! Vlive during the American leg of the LY tour he indicated on how he doesn‚Äôt follow what the agency says when he tried to drink wine in fron of the camera LOL! üòÇ) For Taehyung, I was thinking of Wonder Woman (yep my ultimate bias with my most favorite DC superhero ever! üíú), especially his evolution as a member of BTS and an idol. Wonder Woman came &gt;! into ‚ÄúMan‚Äôs World‚Äù !&lt; as a na√Øve idealist (not thay she was dumb, but it‚Äôs just that it was a whole new world for her as she grew up in an all-female somewhat-utopia world) but her experience as time passed made her a wiser and more introspective person &gt;!(especially in the war in the Wonder Woman movie)!&lt;. I think it‚Äôs the same for Taehyung as well: he came into BTS as a seemingly na√Øve and very youthful boy (not that he‚Äôs dumb (he‚Äôs pretty intelligent) but he came from a rural upbringing that was immune to the intensity that the idol life and city life provides). However, as BTS became more famous, we got to see his growth in maturity and his more introspective side more. Both Wonder Woman and Tae are loving and quite idealistic in their beliefs. For Wonder Woman, she‚Äôs willing to fight for those who she cares the most &gt;!(avenging for Steve‚Äôs death in the movie)!&lt; along with her beliefs in justice and equality. For Tae, you can see him hyping and caring for the members (maybe bot as outright as Jimin, but in subtle ways such as praising Hobi for his looks and telling him that he likes him too much in Hobi‚Äôs B-day Vlive, buying RM the gift that RM has always wanted in BV3, stepping up to mention Jin‚Äôs graduation from colleg when the staff (I think) was talking about Jungkook‚Äôs graduation in the Spring Day comeback show iirc, hyping up Yoongi‚Äôs rap, buying the thread for Jimin in BV3 when Jimin needed some and praising Jimin‚Äôs artwork when the members were praising Jungkook‚Äôs artwork and paid no attention to Jimin who also did as well (second time bringing Jungkook in, I‚Äôm sorry, JK), and got Jungkook out of his shell and became his first close friend when Jungkook was at his shyest (especially the showers)), and his idealism as well (his famous OT7 quote-love all 7 members and don‚Äôt leave any of them behind iirc). I think he‚Äôs also a bit of Captain Marvel as well with the surprising amount of talents that he has in store (he‚Äôs the secret second ‚Äúgolden maknae‚Äù as well...shhhh) &gt;! just like when Captain Marvel tried to free herself from captivity by her former fellow Kree civilizations, she unleashed all the power that she had resulting from the alteration she experienced (which also resulted in loss of memories) when she crashed into Kree but was oppressed by a device in her neck that she freed herself from when she was freeing herself from captivity !&lt;. I think it‚Äôs the same for Taehyung as well: as a singer, dancer, contemporary artist, photographer, saxophone player, piano player, stage performer, composer, producer, intelligent and creative thinker, etc. Also, not to be haughty or anything, but I think I put this idea (BTS to superheroes) under a Shazam post under this subreddit the other day. Thank you for creating this post! üíú",0,3806,667

"&gt;I had thought I‚Äôd gotten over much of my shyness but coming to Korea and not knowing the language has hit HARD. I used to say every day I lived in Japan felt like the first day of school, so it's funny to see your comment on a post about first-day of school anxiety! The feelings can be very similar; like you're not 100% sure how to fit in or what to say, you're intimidated to talk to people because you're afraid of making a mistake, and you feel like everyone is looking at you all the time. The worst mistake I ever made language-wise was trying to order mushroom pasta, but getting the word for mushroom flipped up and accidentally ordering ""shit tree"" pasta. When you think about ""what's the worst that could happen?"" that's pretty much the pinnacle, right? Cursing while trying to order pasta. But thankfully, the waitress giggled and explained the word I wanted. It's been 10 years, and though I doubt the waitress ever thinks about that incident (and if she does, I bet she's laughing, not offended). But for me, that mortifying mistake turned into a good memory and a funny story. So I hope OP continues to push forward in class and I hope you'll go to that macaron store. You'll either breeze through it like a champ *or* come out with something the clerks won't remember in 10 years but will be a great story for you! I wish both of yall good luck!",0,1365,252

"That's a good point about the previous attempts made in English by kpop artists. I just don't think Wonder Girls or CL had a strong enough base in the US to begin with, or at least nothing close to what BTS has now. (Boy groups tend to spark more interest/passion from fans in the US) I think previous forays into the US market by Korean artists were made prematurely, without any demonstration of success preceding them. Our boys, on the other hand, are at peak growth in the US right now, with proven marketability and sales via concert tickets and music sales. But the truth is, at this moment, BTS' influence in the US and the western world is largely confined to metropolitan areas with large numbers of minorities. They're not yet a household name, though I believe wholeheartedly that they can be. I just don't know if it'll happen with so much resistance to them singing in English. And now's the time for Big Hit to really think strategically about BTS' growth here, while their momentum is at the highest it may ever be. Things change quickly in the entertainment world. And thank you for the encouragement :) I understand that many people here just want to protect BTS, as do I. Maybe speaking from a more business-focused standpoint comes off a bit cold, but I love the boys and just want them to succeed. &amp;#x200B;",0,1330,237

My take was just an attempt to see how perhaps Bighit/BTS might feel from a more personal standpoint, knowing that BTS themselves have mentioned their participation in the direction of the group. But definitely we have no absolute idea their personal takes on the issue. Would just like to add on the ""don't fix it if it ain't broken"" mentality- past advances of Kpop artists with English singles (Wonder Girls with Like Money and CL with Lifted) have not done as well as expected, and I do remember many accusations about how the singers are losing their roots by conforming to generic American pop in favour of mass appeal; it is likely that Bighit wants to be more careful.

"I think ARMYs, what with our history of having to defend ourselves for years, are fairly good at trying to stop massive spread of misinformation. If there is misinformation spreading, we'll try to flood it with corrections and there is an attitude of trying to not engage unless it's defensive. There are few bad apples, but we try to not spread wrong information in massive organized way. The other fandoms that hate us don't do this though. If they spread wrong information and they get caught, they don't put out the correct information. Sometimes they even post it on their large twitter accounts with English translation, and when it's proven they're wrong, they pretend nothing's happened with no corrections. I'm assuming it makes it difficult for their international fans to actually find the correct information sometimes unless they actually go to other fandom sites. I think they will catch up though. Especially as new groups come along without the old baggage. I remember international fandoms were saying BTS was not popular in Korea, only internationally, for like a whole year after everyone in Korea agreed BTS was popular in Korea.

They achieve good balance in that we are invited to suspend our disbelief - it would have worked if these were fictional characters in a film - but the context precludes that, effectively making us more aware of the camera and the reality that this is all a photo shoot.

"Thank you for such a civil response :) I'm sad to see that so many fellow ARMY have downvoted my comment, which is just my opinion from a business standpoint. I want BTS to have as much success as possible throughout the world. We can't presume to know the boys' individual feelings on this issue. But Big Hit is a business and they need to make money, so my comments are speaking toward that. Until now, the kind of success BTS is seeing in America is something k-entertainment companies have only dreamed of. That's why they put an English speaker in just about every group. (They've been doing this since the mid-2000s at least, when I first got into kpop.) BTS is the first one to really gain a foothold here, so they're the first with the potential to really profit from creating songs in English. The argument of losing their identity is tough to believe given that they already released WIOM, which is fully in English. And though I agree that singing in Japanese has been normalized for Korean singers, I don't agree with the other fans saying this is because the Japanese and Korean languages and culture are similar. The languages may be closer to each other than English, but the cultures and identities of the Japanese and Korean people are very different. If we don't remember this, we risk encouraging the ""all Asians are the same"" stereotype that artists like BTS are helping to break. Korean artists have been singing in Japanese for so long because the Japanese market is highly profitable. And now BTS is the first with a chance at that same level of success in the US market. That's why they're the first to be confronted with this decision to (or not to) sing in English. And if they want to become a household name, it's something that should be re-considered. (P.S. I'm sooo proud of the boys' success thus far. Back in the mid-2000s, I never would've believed a kpop band could blow up in the US like they already have. It's a huge testament to their talent and hardwork.)",0,1995,357

"Miss Right. It's a sunny day song we hit the road early with the windows down and enjoy the breeze. We'll go to a little restaurant and pick up lunch, then head over to the park and eat it on a blanket in a grassy area. We talk about silly scenarios and how we would react to them, tell each other dorky jokes, relive fun memories of our pasts, and discuss interesting facts with each other. Before we leave, we chase each other around, hiding behind trees and peeking out, only to end up out-of-breath and laughing in a heap on the grass while looking up at the sky. Head to a bookstore afterwards and search the shelves for something new to read. As we look around we talk about our favorite books, authors, and subjects we enjoy. As the discussion goes on, we end up tugging each other deeper into the shelves where no one can see so we can steal kisses from each other. We leave the store with only one book but a lot of sweet memories. Then we hit some clothing shops, not really buying anything but just trying on outfits that the other person has picked out. Some outfits look silly and cause us to giggle while others blow us away because the other person looks so good. We leave the clothing stores and head to a home-goods store. As we walk around and look at decor, we talk about our dream home, how we would decorate it and what it would look like. This leads to conversations about our ideal future concerning spouses and family-life. One of the sales-clerks mistakes us for a newly married couple and we go with it. We hold hands as we walk around the store. It's getting close to sunset now so we decide to head out for ice cream. As we sit outside the parlor and watch the sun fade, we talk about our dreams and goals. The night ends with us realizing we're more alike than different.",0,1800,340

"Following up from what other people have said about the comeback trailers being the Intro track of an album, BTS have been using Intro, Outro and Skit as their own distinct album structure since debut. When I say distinct I mean among K-Pop Groups, because it‚Äôs actually inspired by older generation hip-hop mixtapes which we all know they were initially trying to emulate. By keeping the album structure this way, they‚Äôre effectively able to thematically organise their discography in a way that enhances the listening experience. The intro was initially only performed by RM because he was the center of their group, the draw or talent. Therefore, his rapping was forefront and center; firstly as the opening solo rap, and secondly as the marketing material - the comeback trailer. Now that their music and group balance has branched away from a RM-centric structure, the intro, and therefore comeback trailer, has become the somewhat iconic album teaser that it is regarded as today. Because of their roots, you don‚Äôt really see other groups with this particular kind of trailer. I hope this answers your question!",0,1117,184

"I think of a comeback as the time period before the release of a new album. Included in a comeback is the release of things such as: comeback trailer (a.k.a. the intro/first song of the new album), concept photos, album tracklist, MV teaser etc. So if somebody says ""this is my first comeback"" it's the first time they're part of the fandom during the comeback period, so they're here to experience anticipation/hype of releases in real time. Does that make any sense? So if I say Persona is my 2nd comeback then it means my first comeback was with the previous album, LY: Answer. And you could probably take it as I joined the fandom after the release of LY: Tear but before the release of LY: Answer. I hope my explanation is sufficient, otherwise just ask :) ",0,762,138

"Its really silly to think that BTS, Bang PD, their producers, all the staff, and the years of preparation that goes into all of their comebacks would cause anything previous to ""go away"". going back to their roots does not mean the same. Do you speak Korean or have you seen the Lyrics for the comeback trailer? Its so beyond different then the begging. That man has grown, hes different and the music is different. Also to touch on your point ""the amazing singers not getting to show their talent"". what does that mean? SLA, O!RUL8,2?, Dark and Wild has A LOT of singing. Hip hop isnt just rapping. Besides rapline only songs they always have singing in their songs. they have put SO MUCH work into this comeback, the storyline, the theme, the connection to their past selves, past music and more then we obviously even know yet. Nothing bighit and bts does is on a whim and not planned out. If anything it sounds like you are disappointed with the trailer and you are afriaf its gonna sound like that because you prefer the songs with minimal rapping (which is totally fine you are allowed that opinion). to say going back to their roots would be a mistake or to make everything a waste makes me sad.

"I have to agree with you on this one. I think it would be more honest if they were to say that singing in English is just not something they're skilled enough at right now. I'm sure RM's statement originated from their PR and management teams, and I think it's a poor decision on their part. Big Hit is putting great time and effort into promoting BTS in the US already, and the market here is the biggest in terms of potential profit. Learning English and one day singing in it would do a lot to help the band grow here in the states, and it would make the fans here feel even more loved as well. Singing in English doesn't mean that anything about the band and what they stand for has to change. It would be a means to spread their message even further and touch the hearts and minds of more people, just like they do in Japan. I get it though. Most of the members' English pronunciation just isn't proficient at this time. But again, the company should just be honest about it.",0,980,187

Rookie King was one of the first things I watched when I got into BTS, it has some iconic moments - Jimin breaking chopsticks with his ass, Cross-dressing from most of the members (Suga as a maid, Jin as an elegant lady running on the treadmills, RM as the most hardass Sailor Moon you‚Äôve seen, Jungkook as a fairy, and V as a ladybug), Vhope recreating a kiss scene from a Frozen Flower, Suga summoning the east wind to help his archery (which he referenced later at ISAC), etc.",0,822,148

"I nearly had an internal meltdown yesterday morning (Sorry that's so dramatic). I'd been looking forward to getting the LY DVD since before they announced it into existence, which was me just hoping they would come out with one before hand. When it was announced and pre-order's went up, a friend and I decided to order it together to save a bit on the shipping. Little did they know, BH cancelled the order and they didn't check their BH account until the day of release. At that point BH had already sold out of the DVD's on their online shop. So we emailed them and got a refund with little explanation of what happened. A few days later, a local GO was happening and were taking bids on the remaining stock on a merch site that was selling it for the same amount as BH. It just so happened that we were on that same merch site debating on whether we should purchase it. After getting led around by the GO site, we were told we wouldn't be getting the DVD. The moment they informed us, the remaining stock on the merch site went out of stock, which led me to believe they were ordering from the same place we were looking at. It was really frustrating and in hindsight, really unethical of the GO to host a silent auction for an unknown amount of stock and taking advantage of that fact. In that moment, my heart sank to the depths of where ever it could go. I had been wanting the DVD because I got into BTS in 2018 and went to their LY concert last year. It was something to remind me of the wonderful memories of the show I went to. The good news is, I managed to find another site still selling it, but wouldn't be releasing it until early next month. Maybe there will be another round of order by BH, but at this point I'm not taking a chance. Crossing my fingers the DVD's arrive safely to me. Also, bought the Kim Youngdae BTS Review, english version, same day for retail therapy purposes. Looking forward to all my stuff coming in after the DVD fiasco!",0,1963,371

But I don't think I've ever seen a major conflict initiated by ARMYs. Occasionally the other big fandoms try to defame BTS or ARMYS (often with manipulated info), but over the past year, the backlash against them have been getting bigger so they have been happening less and less frequently. I remember even about 1 year ago, there were frequent hate still against ARMYs. But it's less frequent now, and I think the last significant attempt to defame we got was when they did illegal voting in January for Golden disk and attempted to say ARMYs did it.

"&gt;If they say that it is inauthentic to sing songs in English, a language they don‚Äôt speak, why isn‚Äôt it inauthentic to sing songs in Japanese, a language they also don‚Äôt speak. I‚Äôll like to hear what they have to say about that. I didn't think they were. The above is specifically what I was addressing, not the value of them potentially singing more in English, but why they feel doing so would be ""inauthentic"" at this point in time vs. their singing in Japanese. I was trying to touch on the history of Japanese-songs in the K-pop industry and why it's different and not ""inauthentic."" The point was never that BTS said they don't want to sing in a foreign language, it's that giving into the pressure to sing in English would only be just that: giving into industry pressure. They could very well decide some years down the road that they want to create all-English tracks, and if they do so it won't be inauthentic because it would be coming from a place of organic creativity. Right now they don't see the point in terms of their identity, so they don't want to do it. Even if it means sacrificing further commercial success (which has been the selling-point of a lot of those in the industry who are encouraging them to do so). Creating music in Japanese may help boost their finances there, but Japan as a stage for K-pop has been present for a long time, and singing in Japanese must feel less contrived than singing in any other language. I thought that's mainly what OP wanted to discuss more, not why BTS doesn't want to sing in English specifically.",0,1565,283

"I totally get why that moment of Jimin touched you so much but I feel every single person‚Äôs improvement shows how much they all commit to being better.

Tae as well, I recently saw their wings commentary again and when Tae‚Äôs solo came on, he talked about how much he wanted the audience to focus ONLY on his singing abilities and how he gave it his all. He said he didn‚Äôt focus on expressions or anything and just wanted his voice to do the trick. He didn‚Äôt break down or get upset but the simple statement and expressions revealed how much he wanted to be taken seriously as a ‚Äòvocalist‚Äô. I guess Jimin has just always been open about his insecurities which is quite a beautiful thing in itself as it‚Äôs not an easy thing to do and makes him strong in his own way. ",0,1090,206

"Another small personal example: I am tri-lingual and find it easy to translate in between the two non-English languages as they share same grammatical construct and many of the words can be directly translated, allowing for meaning to be conveyed without much loss. Any kind of translation, regardless of the effort put into it cannot capture the intrinsic meaning of words, the wordplay, the cultural significance of certain phrases, the imagery invoked. Reading something in a language and then reading it's translation often makes you realize how difficult it is to even think of conveying the meaning with context. I really admire the wonderful talented people in this fandom who translate all BTS media content for us viewers, without whom we would have been lost. If you have a primary language and you learn another language later in your life, you get into the groove of translating sentences because you think in the language you are comfortable in. BTS is involved in the process of creating their music. They pen down their emotions and this is what resonates with the audience. If they don't feel comfortable in English, if they feel that they will be unable to convey their emotions through that medium, who are we to judge? ",0,1238,208

Of course, I don't really pay too much attention to any of BTS's footwear choices in general that often, hahaha. \^ \_\^; And poor Jimin.

"Wikipedia would like to disagree. There's a page called ""Slave contracts"" in reference to K-pop contracts. &amp;#x200B; SM is known for terrible conditions. You might know that Kris, Tao, and Luhan sued to get out of EXO-M, citing restrictions on their living conditions, treating them differently from the Korean sub-group, and, in Tao's case, multiple injuries that were mistreated and swept under the carpet. I agree that the term ""slave contract"" is a little much, but hey, that's the term for it now, i guess. ",0,515,85
"I do think that there is a larger overarching era, that ties in different eras you mentioned. And I do think that Persona is probably last part of the bigger overarching era. I'm not convinced they planned this from the start. I feel like they probably just tried to finish the School era at the beginning, and I wanna almost go back in time and pat them on the back for not going bankrupt and finishing the School era. Around Wings, it was clear that they were really making this thematically connected, instead of episodic. Not sure if they planned it around the contracts, but it makes sense that they would have loosely worked the schedule to finish one story before enlistments start, etc. BTS is so fun. Each song tells a story. Each album tells a story with a beginning and an end. Albums bundle to create an era that tells a story. And even eras bundle together to tell a story..that seems to now have something of an intro, progression of story....and are we getting the denouement?

We‚Äôve known each other and lived with each other for 4 years. We were discussing increasing diversity in the workplace and about Asians getting hired and such. I, however, cannot believe she told me ‚ÄúAsians aren‚Äôt a minority,‚Äù and then proceeded to argue that her people (she‚Äôs a different minority) are truly minorities. I hate it when people try to compare struggles and downplay mine. I got so mad, I walked off and heard her whisper about me to my other close friend about how I won‚Äôt ever understand because I‚Äôve never been in poverty and that my parents were both college educated while hers were not. That‚Äôs not what it means to be a minority?!!? And how does that mean Asians as a whole are not a minority in the US??? Thankfully, my other friend backed me up and tried to convince her that she misinterpreted my anger. When I retreated into my room, I heard them whispering more. My other friend asked her if she will talk to me but the mean friend said ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want to,‚Äù and walked off. Today, she‚Äôs acting as if nothing happened. I understand that I come from a place with more privileges than her, so I always accepted it when she downplayed my anxieties, struggles, and stresses for the last few years. She‚Äôs struggling with clinical depression and I know what that feels like because I was there at one point in my life. She‚Äôs confided in me about how her mental health issues are seriously diminishing her quality of life.

"Just like all the other CEOs of Entertainment Companies in Korea, he has a hand in everything. How much may differ form project to project. Music wise, right now with BTS, I'm pretty sure its less compared to the involvement in the past. BTS are seasoned pros now but I RM has said countless times, he still gives his input when needed or asked. I remember RM talking about Mic Drop and how much angrier it was before BANG PD got involved and suggested a change in tone that J-hope gave it a different vibe. Music wise with TXT, I'm sure he has more say so since they are new to the scene. However, BANG PD is about developing his artist to do things on their own. So with each new project, as TXT finds their own unique voice, he will let them take more control and become a back seat driver like he is with BTS and step in when needed. Overall though, nothing gets put out with the approval of him. You'll definitely see him on more projects for his artist in the future because he is a producer/song write before anything else. Like his artist, he is always creating and he gets to share that work via his artist and others in the industry. Outside of music, he is definitely involved with the storytelling of each group and helping them get whatever their message is across through various contents too.",0,1307,243

But because BTS has been able to do it and has reached this insane height of popularity, stans of other groups view their success with offense just because it wasn't their group. Never mind if BTS is actually talented and worked hard--they don't care about that. BTS's success isn't enough to make other groups popular aside from making the market more open-minded.

The old fandoms that used to bash us had their bad behavior in trying to defame BTS all aired out, now that ARMY is so big. And the fandoms of newer groups are happy that BTS is paving the way. I've seen people from other even say that they're happy that ARMY kinda ended the tyranny of the older larger fandoms - because they used to bash other fandoms a lot too, and they were often too small to fight back. The international fandoms are so slow to update. It is no longer fashionable to hate on BTS and ARMY.

"I remember being in middle school or maybe early high school when I saw Wonder Girls perform on TV (on America's Got Talent if I recall correctly). While I did listen to some K-pop back then I wasn't familiar with them at the time. Later on, I started really loving Sunmi after ""Full Moon"" and rooted hard for Yubin on Unpretty Rapstar. Looking back, it kills me to find out that their US debut went that badly. I really thought ""Nobody"" was such a bop but it's so hard for international artists in this market if they're not British, Canadian, etc. So, yes, BTS's success is so significant and if anyone has the right to boldly declare that from the rooftops, it's Sunmi. It took so long for a successful K-pop debut to happen in the West and it's unbelievably hard to break that inertia. I mean, it's been like 40+ years since Bruce Lee's death and we're still struggling for Asian representation in film. In some ways I'd say it's even more difficult for music. Aside from being an ARMY, I'm just so happy to see things going in the right direction as an Asian American.

"100%. I hate when people weaponize legitimate problems/movements to justify their fandom hate. So much of the hate BTS receives from Western non-Kpop fans is aimed at their perceived lack of masculinity or an old belief that ""boy bands"" have no depth. When a girl group tries to debut in the US, I'd argue that the bulk of the obstacles they face aren't necessarily because they're women, but because they are Asian, not English-fluent, people are prejudiced &amp; judgmental towards other cultures, etc. I don't think it's all that different from the difficulties boy groups face (except, like you said, for the gender standards K-pop boy group's also challenge).",0,664,109

I'd also like to address how BTS's journey and personal priorities might have contributed to the similarities and differences of this track duo. But that might only be good for an audience only made up of ARMY's haha. If it was just an average audience, I think a presentation on the storytelling of the HYYH trilogy would be engaging.

"Ooh, I forgot the other most important skincare of all. SUNSCREEN! Every day, rain, shine, or indoors. Use sunscreen, and use the right amount, which is about a teaspoon for your face. Is that a lot? Yep! Which is why Asian sunscreens are your best friend. Unlike American brands, they won‚Äôt leave you looking like an oil slick. And they protect from both UVA and UVB, so you get anti-cancer and anti-aging benefits. My absolute holy grail sunscreen is the Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence. They updated the formula this year to a crazy new tech that creates a micro net on your skin, so no microscopic cracks appear and let harmful rays in. It goes on light and smooth, dries down to a soft satin matte, plays well with makeup, and leaves no white cast at all (Armys of color, rejoice!). Seriously, it‚Äôs magical. I would buy giant pump bottles if I could. But whatever kind you like, wear it every day. Take it from your nice Auntie SonomaVegan, kids.

"Keep in mind that the bulk of the Japanese songs they release are only Japanese versions of pre-existing Korean songs. Even then, it's is extremely difficult to rewrite your song in another language, and practice them for live concerts. Imagine how arduous this is for the Rap Line in particular. And, yes, relative to English, making Japanese songs *is* exceedingly easier for them pronunciation-wise. They grow up already more familiar with Japanese terms, etc. just like English-speakers in the US can grow up learning some off-hand Spanish. There is also several years of history where the Japanese market has been closely supportive of K-pop, be it because of their receptiveness to the Korean market or their own history with J-pop. It's not just a BTS phenomenon. Speaking of other K-pop groups, they can aim content towards the Japanese market while knowing that if they want to hold a concert in Japan, they will be welcomed and it will be a success. Not so with English-speaking countries (just look at all the failed US debuts of other K-pop groups in the past). In that regard, BTS is indeed an exception, and even then only a recent exception. More so, making English content would feel like an attempt to appease an expectation, rather than a genuine choice that comes from passion or gratitude on their part. Besides, putting in the effort despite their busy schedules to learn English in interviews is something we should be very grateful for. I personally think that's a lot to ask already, but it's meaningful to them that they do it. If you say they should release English content for their fans, by that logic they should do the same for other fans all over the world. Obviously, that's not practical or feasible. If doing solely Korean content means quality music and a genuine satisfaction for their creative drive, then that quality over language quantity is preferable for me. If they think doing all-English songs detracts from their personal authenticity, then it does. I think it can be a matter of personal integrity and, whether we understand their reasoning or not, it matters to them. As fans we just have to accept that.",0,2152,366

"Magic Shop ‚Ä¢ Song details It‚Äôs a fan song, Jungkook wrote and helped produce the song. ‚Ä¢ RM‚Äôs verse There‚Äôs a lot of references to past things RM‚Äôs said (i.e. everyone has their own galaxy, ‚ÄúSea‚Äù, one of Joon‚Äôs past tweets). Namjoon and (sorta JK in extension through the rest of the song) references Joon‚Äôs last ment on the Wings tour and that speech of his has always sort of hurt me LOL. In the ment, he talks about how they‚Äôve gotten fan letters saying that while the fans are happy and proud that BTS has gotten all these achievements, they feel as they haven‚Äôt progressed in the same way and that sorta distresses them. Joon then goes on to say how in the beginning, the members didn‚Äôt think much of themselves. They didn‚Äôt think they would achieve much at all. But then, here they are now. ARMY is the one that saw that potential in them and gave them wings. I sort of understood it as ‚ÄúYou gave us this ability to succeed, you also have that power within you to succeed, BTS will try and support you through your endeavors (with our music and performances)‚Äù. And there‚Äôs lines in the song where it seems to directly reference the ment (‚ÄúYou saw us, You recognized us‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou gave the best of me, you‚Äôll give you the best of you‚Äù). And then the last line of his verse, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the last reason as I stand at the edge of the abyss‚Äù. It‚Äôs sort of a dark line when I first read it, but as we now know contract negotiations were coming up and during one of the end of the year award shows Jin mentioned how they considered disbanding. Which is sort of a crazy thought, but considering how they really blew up in the US after LY: Her, they must‚Äôve felt an incredible amount of pressure to get it right. And we know from Jimin‚Äôs recent log that he was feeling pretty down before LY: Tear‚Äôs comeback. He wondered why he was working so hard for and realized after watching a video of ARMY singing ‚Äú2!3!‚Äù that ‚ÄúAh, this. This is the reason‚Äù. ‚Ä¢ Suga‚Äôs verse Here, Suga talks about how in the beginning he thought all he wanted to do was to succeed, but in the end he only wanted to comfort fans. And you can definitely see his growth from the August D mixtape to songs like Paradise. I also sort of think it‚Äôs interesting how this change in him is paralleling Eminem‚Äôs, who I believe is one of his favorite rappers. ‚Ä¢ Theories Magic shop is also the name of a psychodramatic technique where the therapist/shopkeeper barters with the individual in order to figure out what they truly need. This technique was shown in the first teaser for Fake Love in regards to the members‚Äô characters in the BU universe. The next Muster is named Magic Shop. So it could be referencing how BTS‚Äô music and performance is a sort of therapy. I‚Äôm sort of interested in how the muster might add to the ‚Äúlore‚Äù of the BU. The technique is also sort of in line with the whole message of the LY series: knowing yourself, respecting yourself. tl;dr - There‚Äôs a lot of layers to the song. The boys work hard for us. I‚Äôm sad lol I sort of wonder if more people would like the song if it was structured more as a ballad or something. ",0,3100,582

"Sounds a bit like gatekeeping to me. Anyway regardless of whether you consider him an ARMY or not, I think it‚Äôs important to have a viewpoint of someone who is not that deep into the fandom as well. Like you said there are videos from other k-army fans as well that can provide a viewpoint of someone who keeps up with all the drama so it‚Äôs good to have another viewpoint who doesn‚Äôt just it from the lens of someone who knows the drama. Sometimes having too much info can also be misleading. For example, for Idol I watched the dkdktv video which explained a lot of Korean culture and idioms and wordplay and I also watched another video by a female fan who seems like she keeps up with drama because she picked up things like RM‚Äôs face changing filters (apparently fans told him off to use filters) but didn‚Äôt cover some other deeper symbolical stuff.

And I absolutely LOVE the irony of their successful venture into the Western market: the fact that they achieved it *without* catering to the typical expectations people have of what it takes to break into the US music industry. By being true to themselves. By keeping their concept the same as it was from the beginning. I hope they continue to grow even though the road ahead seems daunting.

"I would say Trivia: Love. I'll say it now, I'm Namjoon biased which probably heavily weighted my choice in song. I often feel like some lyrics or concepts seem to go over people's heads. Why: There are many things I like about this song, from wordplay, to the feel, etc; but I'll emphasize on Namjoon's more poetic and philosophical thought process. On the poetic side, RM saying knowing love is like knowing how your fingernails grow or that the way trees shed their leaves is very beautiful. The comparison of love to fingernail growth is saying that it's just something under your notice, until it becomes something you can't ignore anymore. That is what love is like to him, something that grows overtime to the point it demands your attention. With the tree lyrics, he's saying that love is natural, just like the seasons - but just like the seasons, love can be cyclical. Your love can grow, plateau and fall. There could be cold winters, blooming springs, and sweltering summers. He's also saying that love is inevitable and with following how he defines love (not just romantic), anyone and everyone will feel it. I also like how he points out how similar love is to live in English and person in Korean. To live is to love, and to love is to be human (Fun fact, Love is the same word as Expensive for me, haha!).",0,1321,237

Also, with the different scenes and outfits in persona that wasn't just his idol persona; such as his rapper persona and leader persona.

And ofc the dynamic of friendship, and time travel just makes it more interesting. I honestly cant think of any artist(Kpop or American or anyone) had the vision to create an entire universe using a bit of their own personality/experiences with fiction spanning over albums. Most of all, the BU doesn't seem like they are going on a fluke and deciding things. Seems planned and thought out.

I think it might be a weird misdirection of concern, a big splash of 'kpop companies are evil so BH must be too', and a love of drama and using public forums to tell BTS what they should be doing(while claiming they're telling the Co not the band). That 'company stan' kpop accusation is no joke, too.

I am a fan of exo for example, I know their music, I watch their content, even members individual ventures tend to get checked out by me, I physically own their album and I would be ecstatic if I met them/had my hand held by them, does that make me an exo-l? No it doesn‚Äôt. The same way many people who call themselves army are not imo. I don‚Äôt think knowing everything about them makes you more of an army, but there is a certain level of connection and dedication I‚Äôd say that does, to me a fan who hasn‚Äôt bought an album, been to a concert etc but has been keeping abreast with them is more of an army than people with the lack of knowledge not only David but most of the people on YouTube who claim to be army have.

"Let me just list out everything as short as possible 1. Kpop is Asian. Japan is an Asian. Therefore it isn't inauthentic to sing in Japanese because it's still connected to whee they come from. English is a completely different thing. Very seperate. 2. If they did it everyone would start accusing them of betraying Korea and selling out and becoming Westernised. In fact this would just be more ammo 3. Everyone has said this but kpop artists translate to Japanese. The all do it its how they roll. 4. Pronunciation is a huge problem. They have a Chinese song. One. Why didn't they continue? Because they don't speak Chinese and from what I know Chinese people barely knew what they were saying. If that happened now with English who even knows what would happen. 5. They, and especially Namjoon, would spend time on this rather than taking a well deserved rest. RM would have to translate Korean songs into English in such a way that suits the beat. Lyrics that he himself spent ages getting just right so that it sounds beautiful and perfect in both Korean and translated in English. Now he has to mess with that. Or the actual beat. Or do you want him to write a whole song from scratch? 6. Do you also expect them to translate/write songs in the other 6 497 languages of the world? You know there are Spanish ARMY and Indian ARMY and Thai ARMY. On every tweet they tweet out I always see what I think is Arabic ARMY. What about them? 7. They've already sung fully english Songs. RM has I think one on Mono and a few other songs I can't remember. They've covered songs like ""Someone like you"" and JK sang ""Oh Holy Night"" completely in english. And there's more. Speaking of JK there's this song called ""Waste it on me"" taht came out last year sung by JK. Is all this seriously not enough? You guys want a whole official album?

"It‚Äôs pretty easy to translate a song from Korean into Japanese and vice versa. I don‚Äôt really know how to explain this well, but a lot vocabulary of the two languages is ‚Äòshared‚Äô due to the influence from Chinese. The Japanese equivalent of a Korean word will have very similar connotations and usages a lot of the time whereas the same can really not be said for the English equivalent. A lot of words also sound very similar - e.g. ÏïÖÎßà and ÊÇ™È≠î used in BST. This happens a lot between French, English, etc. too due to Latin roots except it‚Äôs even more frequent for Korean and Japanese since there are fewer influences on the languages (both are made up of mainly ‚Äònative‚Äô words and Chinese ‚Äòloan‚Äô words but now also some English/Western ‚Äòloan‚Äô words for the modern language). The grammar is also almost identical and both are more or less the opposite to the way Eurocentric languages like English are structured. **Since grammar and vocabulary wise the languages are very similar, translating a song into Japanese from Korean takes relatively little effort compared to the amount of effort it would take for English.** You can literally do a direct translation and just adjust here and there where it sounds a bit awkward. **So it‚Äôs a pretty low effort job with the potential for a lot of profit.** For the authenticity part, I think because you can more or less directly translate the Korean into Japanese, you can keep the meaning of the lyrics. It‚Äôs not just the meaning but also other things too like the flow and feel of everything. I can read the Japanese and Korean lyrics for their songs and they ‚Äòmake sense‚Äô unlike many of the lines translated into English which just look extremely awkward. Namjoon has been criticised by Western journalists and whatnot for the way he phrases some of his English. I think this is because when he tries to say something longer and more complex (without prior planning unlike his UN speech) he thinks in Korean, directly translates and adjusts as he listens to himself. With Japanese, even if he did the same, it would more or less come out sounding fine 90%+ of the time. I get what you‚Äôre trying to say with the authenticity part with them not really being fluent in Japanese, but because you can phrase yourself in very similar ways in Korean and Japanese, and because culturally the two countries share many more similarities, they lose far less of their original meaning when they make Japanese versions of theirs songs so I think they still keep some ‚Äòauthenticity‚Äô. ^(Besides, even if it wasn‚Äôt the case, the entire world‚Äôs economy doesn‚Äôt revolve around America, Europe, etc. Just like the Western economy DGAF about catering to Asian countries a lot of the time, Asian countries don‚Äôt have to for Western countries. They‚Äôre free to make songs in whatever language they like and not have to provide reasons or excuses for picking one language over another.)",0,2908,505

I know Japanese really well - I play games and read books in it at this point, and I studied Korean a bit so I have an idea how similar/different they are, and it's still a whole other language/culture to learn. I don't think English being super different from Korean more than Japanese is a good argument here. Also, I mean, the only reason why they release songs in Japanese is not because of Japanese being similar to Korean, it's because there is so much yen to be made by going to Japan cause the music industry is so big there. ",0,692,127
"The big one I was waiting for DKDK to comment on was the dogs, pigs, pearls lyric. So interesting to learn about the traditional korean idioms. There could be a double/triple entendre here too. It could also be a [pearls before swine reference](  from Matthew 7:6 in Jesus's Sermon on the Mount: ""Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces."" I think this has the same meaning as the idiom- the strangeness of rewarding him (namjoon) for the celebrity persona of RM, when his true self (namjoon) doesn't understand what he's getting it for. Another annotated [genius translation](  gets more political and says *The mention of dogs and pigs could be a reference to the the controversial comments made in mid-2016 by the head of Korea‚Äôs Ministry of Education‚Äôs policy bureau, Na Hyang-wook. He claimed that 99% of South Korea‚Äôs people could be treated ‚Äúlike dogs and pigs‚Äù because they had no ability to move up in the world, therefore were simply being fed and kept alive. This caused an uproar in South Korea at the time and drew attention to the extremely classist and elitist structure of their government. This topic has also been addressed by BTS in their song ‚ÄúAm I Wrong?‚Äù off their 2016 Wings album. By questioning whether he falls into this system or something else entirely, RM continues his own self reflection to discover his identity.* *Have ears but don‚Äôt listen Have eyes but don‚Äôt see Fish live in all our hearts Its name is selfish, selfish We‚Äôre all dogs, pigs, become dogs because we‚Äôre angry* TLDR: namjoons sexy brain ",0,1641,286
"I'm suspecting the language's idioms and stuff are easier to translate since Korean and Japanese do have Chinese influence and like how the most beautiful moment in life (HYYH) uses Korean hanja (Chinese text more or less, sometimes with different meaning but alot of times similar) actually has the same meaning in chinese. This is my thought though so don't take it too seriously, since I doubt I can speak their thoughts. ",0,425,72

"When I watched this video, I also realized I had a very different first impression that did a 180 afterwards! And I can see why Danny would predict a dark-sounding album. I think there are a lot of visuals/lyrics that kind of highlight the ""darkness"", like the Namjoon figurines shattering at the end of the video and also words like ""die"" and ""cry"". Since the song is all about the Persona, or the outward mask, maybe the ending of the song is not an acceptance of the persona, but more like being defeated by the persona? Kind of like how DNA was about the very misleading honeymoon phase of a relationship, this song could also be Namjoon putting on the RM mask and pretending that he wants to achieve more and be everyone's support. Don't know if what I said made sense, still trying to gather my thoughts after watching the video! hahahaha",0,844,153

"I'm gonna cheat and pick two so I can talk about their interconnectedness but **Road/Path** the hidden track from 2 Cool 4 Skool and **Sea** the hidden track from LY:H. I'm sure I've written before how much these tracks mean to me, Road/Path being my favorite BTS song of all time because it is *the* song that convinced me to stan BTS back in 2013. I had never seen a kpop group make a hidden track before and I don't know if I'd ever heard a Kpop track be so... vulnerable (I'm not saying they don't exist I just hadn't heard them). It is every fear of a rookie, every struggle they've had to get there, and the strength they have created to make it where they are (debut) Suga writes ""I thought I was alone but I've learned that we are seven / No longer barefoot, wearing shoes called Bangtan."" As an audience I can go back and hear that vulnerability from all those years ago every time I listen and it brings tears to my eyes each time. And what is so resonant now is that they had *no idea* what was heading their way and how much they would have to survive together and the heights they would reach. They had faced so many trials and finally were debuting and could not possibly foresee the depth and breadth of their coming trials. Which brings me tooooooo Sea their second ever hidden track 4 years after the first. And you can see suddenly, they have reached those insane heights, they rose through the ranks, the won daesangs, they had the weight of expectation on them, they were already reaching heights that no other kpop group, and few stars in the world have ever achieved. And the result is that they still have so many of those fears, and are now also shouldered with an incredible amount of pressure that in their rookie days was simply not the same. Everything is heightened, everything is 10 fold, everything has been dialed up to 11. This track contains my favorite line of any BTS song ""Where there is hope, there are trials."" to me it speaks of that great weight they have found pushed upon themselves. When they debuted it was with a starry-eyed hope that they might one day win a rookie award or a music show and now, it is the hope that they can influence their millions of followers and fans in a positive way, that they can bring joy and self reflection and remain authentic even when people are pulling them in all directions. And what is truly *TRULY* amazing is that Sea was nowhere near their peak. They have surpassed every single record, every single expectation, all possible metrics in the year and a half following it's release. What I love about both these tracks is they are so tied to their deepest thoughts at the moment of recording. Their fears, anxieties, and dreams. Every time i listen to them I can hear those thoughts and also look back and know all of the success and difficulty they have had in the time between. Every listen adds something new, every listen makes them more meaningful. Road/Path has been in my rotation for 6 years and every single listen gives me something new to appreciate about how far they have come as artists, and as human beings. That is why they are my favorite BTS songs, and the day they release another hidden track I'm sure I'll add a new song to the ""automatic tears"" list that I already have. (Thank you for coming to my ted talk) ",0,3315,611
"Paradise There are certainly other songs I love more than this one, though this one is definitely in my Top 20. The lyrics just spoke too true to me as a high school senior applying to college...I felt like I'd been pigeonholed into chasing a very specific path in life that the other students in my school were also somewhat blindly chasing. I was constantly questioning what I wanted out of my life, and why I thought it was so important for me to ""do well"" when there were an infinite other methods to happiness. Paradise's lyrics comforted me so much during these tense months, telling me the opposite of everyone else has been saying - ""It's alright to stop / Theres's no need to run without even knowing the reason / It's alright to not have a dream."" Things ended up well for me but I still like to keep these lyrics in mind. I'd talk about the above and the Marxist theory that's related, because I'm a sucker for philosophy. I think it's just a great song to share with people when they're in rough spirits and it really follow's Bighit's motto, ""Music for healing.""",0,1075,197

"Either BS&amp;T or Fake Love Dance Practice For me personally, and for other people as well. The moment I fell in love with BTS‚Äôs dancing, was the moment I fell in love with BTS. I think their choreography is something really special that most other idol groups can‚Äôt compare too in terms of complexity and meaning. As time went on, (and I watched more BTS dance practices and such), I fell in love with Jimin‚Äôs dancing. Something about how he hits each beat is so unreal and feels just amazing to watch (kind of euphoric). But what also had me fall in love with Park Jimin was a short clip of him backstage after a Spring Day concert. He was crying about his voice cracking during the performance and saying he wasn‚Äôt good enough. Even too this day, during an award ceremony he talked about how he will become a better singer. His commitment to becoming better, despite really being on top of the world, is something all other idols lack. So with that last paragraph I might change my answer to that clip? Or perhaps if people are wondering why I like Jimin so much specifically, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd show.",0,1102,201

"Yes. For me, personally, I'd prefer that BigHit style him with the more adult look. He's closer to 30 than 20. I think people sometimes don't take Jin as seriously as they should, and I think it's in part because he's often still styled as a teenager. Just my opinion, of course.",0,279,52

His browline and high forehead, when exposed, show the overall harmony of his face and the shape of his eyes. He looks more his age rather than as a teenager. At a few concerts and awards shows, when his bangs were styled up, or away from his face, he legitimately looked like a cover model or a perfect painting.

"In my opinion, I'm sure there is a balance between ""this would look cool; Army will love it"" and in-depth creative thinking. Never forget that Bang PD has a degree in Aesthetics, which in my understanding is sort of philosophy and art theory combined. They also work with professional artists - their choreographers, MV directors, photographers, etc. Maybe some of those people just mechanically go through the motions, but most artists want to understand the history and theory of their work - imo they're not artists if they don't have an understanding of their craft beyond the mechanical. I don't think the people making these decisions are just generic staff members. It also is totally plausible to me that they intended at least some of the effects mentioned in the article. As a former art history major, I think about effects and perception with everything around me. While I don't create, if I did I would be extremely intentional about creating effects that most people might only get subconsciously if at all. I don't necessarily think in jargon terms, but it's the ideas that matter, not the words used to express them.

"I have a lot of feelings about this. English as a language has been almost forced upon many other countries through distribution of culture with very little room for other languages and cultures in English-speaking countries; in the rare case that other cultures and languages are highlighted in English-speaking countries, they are usually pigeon-holed as novelties or 'others' with little to no distinction between the 'others'. Probably the most popular example of this controversy is Shakira being chosen to sing the World Cup anthem for South Africa, despite being Colombian. BTS's identity is linked with their language, and their language is linked with their culture. The more people are exposed to it, the less likely they are to be pigeon-holed, and the more likely it is that the 'English vs. others' dichotomy will start to fall apart.

But I've been following kpop long enough to know that the Hallyu Wave in Japan was dead up until recently and Japan was mostly tired of Korean singers even though they were singing in Japenese. Even Boa had a couple of rough years there in terms of sales. Japan and Korea still have tons of political tension. So when BTS still sings in Japenese, I wonder if it's because of that conflict because when it comes to America and subsequently everywhere else besides Japan, they are very adamant on being authentically Korean.",0,696,119

"First Jimin than Hobi, now Joon... all of these logs make me both happy and sad. Okay so another rough translation, which I hope is helpful: &amp;#x200B; Joon says this album (LY: Tear) was difficult to make. He started four days after getting discharged from the hospital, and he mainly worked on the lyrics... a lot of things happened but Joon's proud to have been able to work on the album. It would have been nice if he had participated more with the melodies but he's satisfied with the work he put in for lyrics. This album (LY: Tear) is abour sadness, and Joon thinks the album-making went well because he used his own experiences with sadness. Joon says sadness isn't just 'sadness' (he's talking about sadness having multiple perspectives &amp; aspects), so it was nice to work on it. In the beginning he had a hard time conceptualizing, of how to make the album... A lot of things happened, but he thinks they were able to make a great album again because of the other members' efforts and their contribution to the team. Joon really likes 134340 and Paradise. He believes, without doubt, that if he believes in himself and improves himself there will be an answer. There's a lot of things that make him happy (members, family, Army, clothes, figures, cafes, parks, nature, etc) and Joon hopes to treasure all of them and fill his life with those things. He wants to say to himself: you're doing good, and you'll do good. Don't doubt youself. Kim Namjoon fighting! He also talks about preparing for Billboard, and that he won't forget he's speaking on behalf of BTS. He'll maintain a positive outlook; they say there's 2 ways of changing the world, first being a revolutionary and second looking at the world with positive outlook. Joon wants to do both. People say he doesn't have to do everything, but Joon wants to hold on to what he has and live trying hard. He says to himself: I think I'm living well, with these thoughts and concerns.

"That intro with explaining Carl Jung‚Äôs theory really helped shed light on the topic. Their interpretation of the song is a little bit different than what I first interpreted it to be. But i‚Äôm super curious if his prediction about this upcoming album being dark will become true. Danny keeps talking about how RM is taking up too much of who is Namjoon which makes Namjoon confused as to who he really is. But it seems like at the end of the song, Namjoon knows and is okay that he is going in the direction of RM. He‚Äôs okay to be labeled as RM the idol. But i‚Äôm not sure if that means he has to give up the shadow of Namjoon or that as long as he knows his shadow is always there to remind him he is Namjoon, then it is okay. Hmmm ",0,731,145

"This is all such interesting and endearing stuff. &gt;Yoongi said that personally, the credits that can be seen externally, who contributed more, the credits, or who holds more rights, etc. Yoongi doesn't pay much attention to such things because ""music is not only about what is visible to the eye"" that things from behind-the-scenes such as the discussions that happen, the process of making the sound, each and every one of these decisions although not visible on paper, all come together to become good music. ""If I can play a part in this, that's enough for me, regardless of how many parts I get or how much rap goes in compared to the past, rather than such things, I would just like to focus on making good music."" I wish I could beam this to the mind of every ARMY. The line distribution or even the credits are never the whole truth. Their contributions and system of making music and performances is more organic than that. He seemed to be pretty enamoured by everything Yoongi had to say in general, which is the fate of every interviewer everywhere. Yoongi's thoughts are always fascinating. Kim noting how he was so frank it even felt difficult to publish ‚Äì that's not a thing you hear about an idol too often, hehe. &gt;But Kim says Seokjin's gaze was really intense. Seokjin sat directly across from him, and apparently Seokjin, with the gazehe has when he's speaking or doing ments at concerts, gazed at Kim for the 30-40 minutes, continuously. So he felt a bit ""flustered"" (he said this 3 times LOL) ""No, he didn't wink... Is his expression usually like that? A very intense one"". He says they exchanged a lot of words but he remembers the intense gaze the most. ""He did not do a hand kiss either"" Understandable. I didn't have big ""wow is this what he is like irl"" experiences about any of them when I saw them at the concerts, but Seokjin did catch me off guard with his intensity. I still remember the moments when he stood at the edge of the stage and stared in my general direction for a few seconds, and how intense he looked ‚Äì being exposed to that in a room for 30-40 minutes must really be something. &gt;What was most memorable of what Hoseok said to Kim: Lately, he truly recognized the importance of communication. To speak and express himself - in the past, I hadn't thought deeply about these things and he regrets them. And he posted on fancafe around this time. Hoseok felt really sorry that although he is aware that you must express and speak constantly to understand one another's feelings, it's often difficult to say so. Hoseok said this to Kim with hopes to deliver this to the fans, which is why Kim is telling this message to us. Kim said Hoseok is very well aware of his gratefulness for the fans and emphasized that he will communicate with fans. Hoseok also said that no matter how much BTS succeds and as BTS grows and reaches higher peaks, all the more, he will communicate even more with the fans and will express his gratefulness to the fans. I have a lot of thoughts about this, but ironically struggle to express them. The importance of communication is something he has talked more and more about the past year or two, and an effort that has not gone unnoticed. Being unable to fully convey the depth of gratitude is relatable. Honestly I'll just end up copy-pasting the entire thing if I continue to pick out especially interesting stuff; it's all really good and endearing. Jimin and Jungkook talking about how none of the members compete with each other, and they have no qualms about asking for help. Namjoon being the thoughtful leader he is and giving credit for Tear's success to the vocal line's evolution. The way this critic talks about this group and its members like he really wants us to have faith in them ‚Äì and then literally saying just that. It's like validation.",0,3832,686

I think it's probably a mix of what he explained in this video as well as a clever way to reclaim the phrase.",0,400,77

And wow, did they discuss a lot. Yoongi didn't hold back at all, and I love him for it. From how they always motivate each other to grow, to line distributions, to contributions in their albums, to just loving music and making it, to exploring new things with their music and not just doing what they think people will love. I think this answers a lot of people's questions. Namjoon praising the vocal line touched me a lot, and I agree that they were all incredible on Tear.

"It's not traditional fondant (which I've never worked with) but something called marshmallow fondant. It's meant to serve a similar purpose but taste better than the standard kind does. Yeah, I agree with your thoughts because I know I didn't actually knead it quite as long as the recipe said, but it LOOKED right, and felt right (going by comparison with video tutorial) so I thought I could take the lazy way out hah hah Next time I would knead it longer, have it cooler in the house and get it put together more quickly so it didn't dry out as much.

"Is video gaming considered a hobby? Lol idek since so many people tend to look at it as a pointless waste of time. So, I've been playing Overwatch for a long time (thanks to BTS actually...!) and I'm a console pleb, but that doesn't mean I try any less hard. None od this will make sense to those who don't play Overwatch but jdkdkkdkd I'm really proud. :') I'm a support main (but I often flex to tank and off-tank) and back when I started, my aim was bad from not playing PvP shooters ever before (girls don't play shooter games, silly) and it was all too fast for me. So I played a healer which required zero aim (Mercy) for like...40 hours? Before I tried someone else? I eventually jumped around a lot, dabbling in dps for a bit and *finally learning how to aim* lol before accepting my fate as a support main. I barely touch Mercy anymore though. So anyways, after putting over 80 hours into Ana, I finally got Play of the Game with her. A good one too, killed a Tracer, nano-ed and saved the life of my Orisa, before pumping damage into a Zarya and taking her down. This was big for me because I feel like I'm just - good with her. I have comfortably solo-healed some matches, shut down high noons, dragon blades, death blossoms...and she has the highest skill ceiling. From one-tricking Mercy and now knowing how to aim to finally getting good at Ana, the one who heals with a sniper rifle. FeelsGoodMan.",0,1412,263

"So my best friend definitely is ARMY and V is her favorite. She has been accumulating a few items which feature Tata. I wanted to surprise her with a BTS-theme cake for her birthday. I already had the heart-shape baking pan, so it was an easy start to this idea. Cake is just a chocolate cake mix which I frosted the edges and top of to make the decorations stick. Red part is marshmallow fondant, tutorial and recipe for which I found online. It was really easy to make and seemed to work out well for this purpose. In the future I would work with it quicker as when it warmed up, it tended to droop off of the sides of the cake and slip downward. Also, it kind of dried out as I worked with it, as you can see by the texture on the top of the design. Had to patch it in a couple of places. It was my first try at using marshmallow fondant and I enjoyed working with it. I think that it really has potential and I have offered to make a cake of Cooky for her son's 10th birthday in June (her other son likes Shooky). I have pretty much beginner-level cake decorating skills. This friend is the one who initiated me into the wonderful world of BTS by dragging me with her to see the BTS World Tour Love Yourself in Seoul just a few short months ago. I wanted to do something meaningful to mark that along with the occasion of her birthday. I kept it a complete surprise until I unveiled it to her and I think she was really surprised and truly loved it. ‚ù§",0,1455,286

"I love them so very much :') My favorite thing about the Love Yourself series is how, despite many people thinking otherwise, it isn't preachy at all. If you actually think about the lyrics, they're just sharing the story of their journey with us, of loving themselves, of their struggles, like they've always done with their music. This is perfectly summed up in one of my fav lyrics ever from Magic Shop ""I won't tell you cliche things like *cheer up*. Instead, I'll tell you my story"" And Namjoon constantly sharing how loving himself is his ultimate goal and how he hasn't figured it out either. Most recently in Persona, he acknowledged how he might never figure out the answer to who he really is. It's that bit, of them not claiming to have it all figured out, but telling us they go through all these things too. That is what touches and reaches people's hearts. ",0,871,156

"This is a very important topic BTS is discussing that is hardly ever addressed and is always swept under the rug by somebody or any country's society itself. In the past, I have been many times vocal or have ""let out"" a mental illness I suffer from and I do note when speaking about it when I tell others of it that one would never notice that I have it because the medication I take for it works so well for me concerning it and masks it almost completely. This admittance of this truth of mine is usually positive because I am a friendly person in general and am open to discussing my mental health condition to anyone who is interested in hearing and learning more about it and how it mat affect me if that question does come up. But some people do see it as a negative thing because of Hollywood's or the media's portrayal of it or ignorance about mental illness and mental health in general shared by other people or in most society's that exist in the world today sadly. I think it's pretty important to be vocal about mental illness and even depression because as I mentioned earlier, Hollywood and television media usually make people with depression or people suffering from mental illness to be monsters, crazy, freaks, and what-not which is absolutely terrible and is not doing the people who suffer from these conditions any favors. And when people watch this stuff, they ""learn"" about this ignorance surrounding mental illness and mental health in the entertainment they consume and think what must be on the screen is true about mental health or a said mental illness when it is not. It's really sad and it's not going to end any time soon I am afraid. : ( But it is always wonderful to hear of other famous people such as the members of BTS talk about mental health and achknoledge that it is not something to be ashamed of, but that it affects many people all over the world and there is always help for anyone suffering from these conditions if they need it.

Luckily, we got great tickets for day one so we're not too picky about day two. I wouldn't worry too much. I think when fans don't get the seats that they want that they will eventually settle. Plus, the tickets that are available all seem to be nosebleeds and there are maybe a few hundred left? A few hundred may seem like a lot but considering the capacity, it doesn't seem all that terrible to me. I highly doubt that the stadiums are going to be half empty.

"This. I appreciate this so much. It is very hard to speak out about mental health issues, let alone acknowledge your personal struggles in front of millions. Not only have Yoongi and Namjoon shared their personal journeys through songs like The Last and Always, but the overall message of embracing your mistakes, growing, and taking care of (loving) yourself in BTS' music resonates on a personal level. These things that they are talking about are so relate-able (no matter the age) that it makes you feel like you are not alone, and there is a way to make things better. Not only that, seeing what BTS has accomplished serves as a hopeful reminder that even though you may be going through a hard time or struggling, there is a way to find strength, push through and achieve or work on things that matter to you. Also, I am so glad Yoongi talked about treating depression/ mental health as a medical condition.

"So, I'm not a humanities person, and a lot of the jargon eludes me too, but I am an academic, so maybe I can help weight in on a couple of your questions. \[And this turned into a mini-essay, sorrrryyy\] First of all, it's helpful to detach *intent* and *effect*. So the author need not know about a choreographers/directors *intentions* to talk about the symbolic *effects* of a stage. If you take a look at this sentence: &gt;In the ‚ÄúE‚Äù concept photos for *Love Yourself* *Áµê* *Answer*, BTS are depicted as marionettes, whose broken bodies can only be kept upright by ribbon, desubjectifying the members and constructing them as passive objects of the \[male\] controlling gaze. The author *doesn't* state that the creative team behind the performance are having conversations like, ""Hey! Let's create a mise-en-abyme in which the members shall be passive objects of the male controlling gaze in order to embody of their alienation!"" But they are claiming that the way they are depicted has the *effect* of desubjectifying the members, etc. This point is itself debatable (why is the controlling gaze male, idgi?), but, it makes sense to me that if you have a performer posed like a marionette, a message is being communicated that the performer's 'persona' lacks agency in that moment. But even though the directors might not be going around saying ""Let's use mise-en-abyme to portray the members as passive objects etc"", I think we can also assume that some of this effect is still intentional, even if it wasn't articulated in the same jargon used by the author. I think we can agree that there is more thought put into the symbolism of these stages beyond, ""Wow, this will look cool!"" As for why the author uses terms like 'mise-en-abyme' and 'desubjectification'... Well, it definitely makes this piece pretty inaccessible, so it makes me question who the intended audience for this piece is. But jargon in any field is used as a helpful shorthand to identify any concept/idea/method, for those also entrenched in the field. It's also a way to connect your ideas to others' ideas. By using the term 'subjectivity', the author is on some level inserting their ideas into an existing conversation/body of literature that uses the same terminology. ....This was not intended to turn into a whole-ass essay, but apparently you can't take the academia out of the academic.",0,2373,399
"I really hope more non-fans read this article. It really helps to convey what so many of us treasure and respect so much about them. I just have so much respect for all the boys.

The way they are always so raw and normalise MH means so much to me. They are so incredibly strong to do so and they always give me so much comfort and reassurance.

"Unsolicited I told a coworker that I used to cut myself because of depression. How depression is not about feeling sad but wanting to feel something. But I did it with a straight face with no emotions. I tried to say it plainly as possible to make a point that this is A FACT about my life and what I think this other patient is feeling (I work in healthcare). One would think I would say that to seek attention to myself so that I can be comforted. But that's NOT what I was trying to do. I was simply trying to normalize depression to make a point that ""it's okay to talk about this."" My point is I'm a noona to BTS yet it's because of them that I can feel so comfortable talking about depression. Forever I've been wanting to look up to someone, a celebrity, and have them do what I truly want a celebrity to do which is HELP their fans and inspire.

"&gt; They express themselves much better in Korean. Man, there's a real art to writing a good song where the lyrics blend seamlessly with the melody and the beat to make the overall song aurally satisfying but still convey the meaning you're aiming at. There are places where a word in a different language ""fits"" better, like I'm thinking about ""Bapsae"" which expresses a Korean idiom using a blend of Korean and a partially English chorus because ""They call me bapsae"" fits better with the beat than if you said it in Korean. And ""chase em"" fits the rhyming structure and meaning right were you need it to. I love that they blend languages to find the best words for the lyric and it makes me happy to see plenty of artists (including western artists) doing the same. In short, OP, let the songwriters be songwriters. They'll choose which language is best to express an artistic feeling and match the melody + beat. Translations, with rare exception, will *never* be as good as the original, and songs *forcibly* written all in another language can feel, well, *forced* or like they're missing something.

They are keenly aware that they have a platform, and they try as much as they can to use it well. I stan the right people. I also think that what Namjoon is talking about, how broadly applicable the ""Love Yourself"" message is, is KEY to understanding Bts' ethos as a group. I've seen a lot of people deride ""Love Yourself"" as being a shallow and cliche message, but I think it's just indicative of how conscientious they are. As Namjoon said, they know they have a wide audience, and they can't in good conscience give any ""advice"" because they know their outlook and experiences are limited. For example, telling one person to ""just cheer up and work hard"" might be what they need to hear, but for many others (especially those with depression or those on the receiving end of systemic issues like poverty or prejudice) it's insulting and damaging.

Maybe they will make a conscious decision to record another song or two in English in the future, but I would not say their doing so would be a result of avoiding ""hypocrisy"" or past ""klutziness."" It would be because they believe they had reached the point to where they can do it WELL and it's the right sound for the song.",0,667,121

As for learning English to sing‚Äîthere‚Äôs a difference between learning song lyrics and learning an entire language. Jungkook does it all the time for his English covers, and that‚Äôs as an extra-curricular activity. Absolutely the Korean language and culture deserves the same respect as any other culture. Asking why BTS can‚Äôt do one song in English when they do entire albums in Japanese is not to disparage Korean culture, nor does it disregard the band‚Äôs workload. It questions the disconnect between their goals and their approach to solving the problem of cracking the U.S. singles market.

"Personally I think there's no point to it if it's not up to their usual standard and I hope they would agree. For example what's the point of having rappers like Suga and J-Hope if you're going to handicap them by making them rap in English? Mic Drop Remix was the most that they've leaned into English for a group song and what happened was that the fans thought the lyrics were cringy and bad, and the locals could barely tell that it was English or what the lyrics were. I thought Fake Love and IDOL had a really good balance Korean lyrics and English lyrics for the English-speaking audience to grab onto while still keeping it comfortable for the members to perform. In general I don't think English songs from kpop groups are the game changer people seem to think they are ‚Äî the only group that I could see doing it successfully rn is Blackpink and that's because it would feel authentic to *them* as a group.

I respect people that sing in English, but for now I'll keep my Spanish."" They probably feel more comfortable expressing themselves in Japanese, and English is much harder to rhyme/flow in compared to Japanese, so they're stuck with very limited options to make it fit the song's rhythm. Even more closely related languages like German or Spanish end up with wildly different lyrics in English just to force the words to rhyme, fit the line length, and not sound too awkward ",0,760,130

They still feel like Bangtan when they sing in Japanese, probably because the countries are so closely intertwined in both language and culture. However they feel like they are being shoved into a mold that doesn‚Äôt fit them if they try to sing (rapping is probably their main concern) in English. I respect that and don‚Äôt have an issue with it. Japanese and English really can‚Äôt be compared. Imagine if a French artist sang in English compared to singing in Korean. Not comparable.

So what you are proposing is multiple songs ""in English,"" with unclear pronunciation. And do you really think BTS is not interested on non-English markets, given their touring locations over the years and the huge fanbases in non-English-speaking countries? They are interested, they are simply not superhuman. You are saying they must learn Japanese, learn English, and sing them well, AND learn choreography, write songs, produce, film shows, eat, sleep, work with other artists, promote, do photo shoots, do Musters, do Festa, travel, perform concerts, and have some semblance of personal lives? For what? In all seriousness, your comment makes me angry. The Korean language and their culture has just as much worth and deserving of acceptance around the world as English.

"I think the large part you‚Äôre missing is that Japan and Korea are culturally similar, so it‚Äôs way easier for a Korean act to get into Japan. Also given their history of the two countries... Also Korean and Japanese are quite similar grammar and sound wise, so it‚Äôs easier for them to speak and sing. How many big Asian singers are in the US? Especially foreign ones... Not a lot, so it‚Äôs way harder than you think to just make it big. Just because the total market is big, doesn‚Äòt mean BTS will take a large part of it. So if even Japan‚Äôs market is small, at least they have the opportunity to be a large part of it. If you watch some of their English interviews there‚Äôs clearly an awkwardness with their cultural and language barrier. The Western world is just not use to their style of quirky. It‚Äôs not racist. Look up what racist means. Considering your idea of it, it would be racist if they didn‚Äôt make songs in every other language as well. They did make a song in English ‚Äî Waste it on Me.

Not English, and they shouldn‚Äôt have to bend over backwards for English-only people. Domt you that‚Äòs a big entitled? Why dont English singers make Korean or any othet language songs? Why do only non-English people have to specifically please English people? The Western market is so multicultural, we should not be afraid of songs that aren‚Äôt in English. Heck, Despacito blew up, so why can‚Äôt a Korean song? We already know we don‚Äôt need to understand the lyrics to appreciate a song. Look at mumble rap, non-lyrical songs, etc...

Well, kpop artists tend to either make Chinese or Japanese versions of their songs because it is an easy way to break it into the Asian market rather than just the tiny country of South Korea.

BTS is praised and so well liked worldwide because they are themselves and don‚Äôt try to pretend they are anything but. Please don‚Äôt push this ‚ÄúBTS has to sing in English to be popular or they are being racist.‚Äù Not everything is about the Western world. P.S. You already have Waste It On Me",0,969,176
"kpop groups and japanese version releases have always been hand in hand and it was so normalized(?) in a sense that i didn't even think about this lmao. with that in mind though, i think since it's more or less a sure thing they'd have japanese songs in their lifespan as a group that they're more prepared for it? unlike having english songs. &amp;#x200B; but who knows! waste it on me is a thing. english versions of songs are becoming common. maybe we'll get there eventually.

"I wrote a comment about this exact thing in a  thread so here it is: They do include some English in their songs, that's a part of their DNA even maybe to a larger extent than a lot of other kpop groups, so there's no ""anti-English"" mentality there. Like RM says in the quote, it's about identity, both from the perspective of the group (who yes, probably does feel closer culturally to Japan, more comfortable with the language etc.), AND from the point of view of fans. BTS know their fanbase really well and they're aware that 1) most fans of kpop groups are into it precisely because it offers something different than Western pop and that includes Korean language, and 2) sincerity and lyrics are very important points to Armys, and if BTS were for instance to release a full English album in hopes of reaching a broader audience, they might very well lose a big part of makes them appealing to their core fanbase in the process. I think most fans see Japanese albums as extra, optional content and it's pretty easy not to pay much attention to them, their impact is very limited outside of Japan. Full English group releases on the other hand would attract a lot more attention, scrutiny and would alter the image and identity of the group on a global scale.",0,1264,228

"Is not racism, they want to stay in their asian roots, since their debut they released songs in japanese (there's also a single of Boy in Luv in chinese), Japanese albuns went well so is a thing for them since 2014. They dont need to keep releasing japanese albuns at this point, but since they are all doing since 2014 it will keep that way, but english songs will be different, i also think that is a part of their charm to the western media to keep releasing korean songs and also their indentidy as a korean group, they don't want to change that and is totally fine.",0,570,108
No way... This is all I‚Äôve ever wanted. PLUTO NATION RISE!!,0,59,11
"Japanese albums were part of the industry before BTS even debuted. To not release those albums would have ruined any chance they had with Japan. If you notice, their more current Japanese albums only have a couple of songs. Their clout is now enough that they can pull back. Frankly, I don‚Äôt want them to release an English album. They express themselves much better in Korean. Also, it would set expectations for the English-speaking market. They‚Äôd have to reduce their overall output just to keep accommodating people that are stuck in a language bubble. And their message would more than likely be watered down. This isn‚Äôt about racism or one market warranting it while another doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs honestly just new territory because English markets are newer for Korean groups. So why bother when the Korean is getting such a good response?",0,838,141
It's both linguistically and culturally far far easier to translate from Korean &gt; Japanese than Korean &gt; English. The sentence structure is almost identical and there's a lot less of a gap in things like untranslatable words or things that would have to be rephrased quite a bit to sound good in English. Converting a Korean song to Japanese is a much smaller task than writing a song originally in English or rewriting a Korean song in English. ,0,452,78

"Uh, BTS wasn't huge in the US until recently. Early on, they were mostly following the standard Kpop playbook, that is, market primarily to SK and Japan, then try for the rest of the world later on. That means that of course they're going to start, early on, learning and singing in Japanese, because that's expected both in the Kpop industry and by the Japanese who consume Kpop. Further, I have seen multiple people say that BTS' Japanese pronunciation isn't the best. But I'm sure the Japanese fans accept this as par-for-the course for most Kpop idols. Do you think Western listeners would be so forgiving of songs in English that don't have flawless pronunciation? They also put out Waste It On Me, and the Mic Drop Remix was mostly in English, though the pronunciation wasn't clear. That said, I notice you didn't say BTS should sing in all Spanish, though there's a huge market of Spanish-speakers. Isn't it possibly ""racism"" on your part to expect songs in English, but not in Spanish?",0,993,173

"Recently I was listening to some mono again, since I realized that I hadn't in far too long. I love it so much. It has such a distinct tone to all of it, and the lyrics are so good, and I've built up a bunch of memories associated with the songs that are fun to remember. It was really interesting listening to forever rain again this time. Since the first couple of listens, I've always found it a really sad and like rather despairing song. The ""Forever rain"" bit especially has always felt to me like softness, kind of calm and soothing, wrapped around a plainly discernible core of something cold and hard and hollow inside. That's a lot of metaphorical language, but I feel like it expresses well how I feel about the song. It's like surface calming but then tucked under the surface is this thin edge of despair that makes me feel a bit cold and empty inside. So it was really interesting to listen to the song again and have it not come across that way to me. It felt like...letting out a breath. That's the only way I can think of to describe it. It was really nice, actually. I felt like emotionally reading it that way made it fit with the album more? Before, when it just seemed sad to me, it didn't really fit with the emotional progression of the album for me, but now it does. I just find really emotionally complex songs like this, ones where there's a lot of things going on and you can interpret it a lot of different ways and it kind of invites studying the lyrics and sound to get a better feel for it, really fascinating. And I'm so hyped for the comeback! This will be my second comeback, and I found  just a little while before Answer and wasn't really on top of all the news and stuff before that, so I'm excited to be able to follow it more closely this time!",0,1783,339

"TM claims they create a new barcode once it is transferred (through resale or friend to friend transfer), hence I personally have more trust buying when TM transfer is available. Some theories depending on the delivery method of the stub hub ticket: If it was a pdf copy or screenshot, the seller could have manually changed the seat number so the ticket barcode is still valid for entrance. They don‚Äôt scan again when you go to your seat. Better seat, higher price? If the Stub Hub ticket was an actual mobile transfer through TM, then it could be a glitch and TM fault, but given their sole business is to sell tickets, I would expect that they have measures to prevent that.

"All of them. I've known BTS for a long while, even though I only really went into stan mode around Her comeback, so it's so funny when ppl talk about Jin like he's actually like the confident chaos king persona he presents. Like, sure, that's something he is and can access but literally every single person in the group and backstage have described him as more quiet, serious, professional and diligent. Yoongi liked rooming with him cause Jin was laid-back and chill. So whenever fans go omg put Jin in charge it'd be pure chaos or smth like that it feels cringey to me cause that just doesn't feel true to me at all. Yoongi and Taehyung get the bad personality discourse most often. Not always mean-spirited but since they actually do and say stuff that idols aren't supposed to (keep it nice and fluffy for the audience), ppl discuss them often as being mean and lazy or immature and bratty. I think with Tae there's kind of been a thing where the fandom has difficulty picking a dominant trait for him in recent years, after he calmed down so much and grew more reserved. There's no clear image for him anymore. And ppl do love those TV character traits...even if fans say they want the idols to be real, that's not really what they're for. Considering the overreactions everytime someone has a bad day or acts differently than what's expected of them, there's clearly a reason why idols present themselves that way.",0,1421,253

"I definitely second this! I really wish they would stop with the ""4D alien"" and ""TaeTae language"" labels. They lead to the unnecessary flanderization and infantilization to the point it has become really irritating. The ""4D"" is supposed to be a compliment in Korean culture for having a unique personality, but the way some fans have been using it is just degrading and insulting to his personality. Same with the alien, it's quite detrimental and dismissive of the ""unique"" part of his personality. Also, don't get me started on the ""TaeTae language"": it just really makes him less educated and intelligent than he really is and is quite dismissive of his uniqueness as well-he actually talks fine imo-and as someone who was diagnosed (or misdiagnosed according to my parents) as ""autistic"" in my childhood due to social and language developmental delays, it not only makes me 100% uncomfortable, but also 100% sure that it makes him uncomfortable as well as someone who stans him. The flanderization and infantilization have gone to a point that there are some fans who see him as ""weird"" and/or ""dumb"" instead of the creative and intelligent person he really is. It actually reminded me so much (why I relate to him so much) of my middle and high school days when I was made fun of my ""unique personality"" due to the social awkward part of my personality due to social and language developmental delays from my childhood that I couldn't really help by some of my peers while I was a top student in my classes (I was a Namjoon of my high school (and Sunday School-some of the worst came from my Sunday School and Church Youth Group peers lol) back in the days) and a top and adept student in my math classes (throughout high school, I made the highest grades or one of the highest grades in my math classes (especially Calculus in junior and senior years in high school)-not to brag, but it's true) as well, and yes, my some of my classmates overlooked me as the ""weird"" and ""funny"" (for no apparent reason-class presentations were a nightmare for me (why I developed a fear of public speaking that carried on even today)-I would see at least one or a small group of kids snickering at me whenever I presented something in front of the class) kid in their class instead of a top student (in both regular and Sunday school) who was a true math geek. Not only that, but he definitely reminds me exactly or almost exactly of my two best friends: one before college and the one I have right now. The best friend I had before college actually had exactly or almost exactly the same personality of Tae and the same amount of endearment I have as well: she has a ""4D personality"" imo; she's generally friendly and gets along with pretty much everyone she meets; she contains a sophisticated or unconventional fashion sense (like Tae, she can wear pajamas as everyday clothes as well-LOL!); she has a high aptitude in language (she aced AP Spanish and even took Chinese 1 in our senior year of high school) and knowing other cultures (Spanish and Korean culture though I don't think she's a KPOP fan LOL); she also has an idealistic and optimistic view of the world and sometimes it may seem like she's in her own world; she has a tendency to be carried by her own identity and perspective of the world; when she's emotional, she can be pretty intense (like Tae-like that one time in high school she had a panic attack because she thought she messed up somewhere in one of our AP exams), etc. However, this similarity between the two of them stick out to me: like Tae, she can seem to be carried by her own world (where the ""4D alien"" for Tae comes from), but she's actually more intelligent than she actually appears (like Tae)-for instance, we were both in the same Calculus class for both our junior and senior years of high school where she slept for every single class (so it doesn't seem like she gained anything from the class), but still got away with A's (not A-'s, like actual A's) in the class every single marking period. Tae's introvert/extrovert level reminds me so much of my current best friend (some fans also seem to exaggerate his level of ""extrovertness"" as the ""social butterfly"" of the group-he's actually a gregarious ambivert or a gregarious introverted extrovert (at best)): my best friend is an ENTP (which is why we're very close to each other because I'm the ""introverted"" version of him-we technically have the same personality except I'm the quieter one lol), which is the ""thinking"" counterpart of ENFP, which is Taehyung's mbti (he is definitely a classic/textbook ENFP), and he's definitely a gregarious ambivert-he loves going out and hanging out with his friends (he has a large circle of friends) and you can always go somewhere and you would see him bouncing around and trying to talk with a bunch of people-he's also more confident in meeting new people than I am (I'm really shy around strangers, but he likes meeting and befriending them) and he definitely loves being around people-however, when he's an environment where he doesn't think he can contribute much (just like Taehyung-you can see him in interviews, variety shows, OT7 vlives, etc.), he just stays in his shell (thinks and observes what's going on) and doesn't talk much. Just like Taehyung, he's also has his long periods of introspection and can be pretty private as well. Introvert/Extrovert isn't all about being sociable or not sociable and how many friends/acquaintances you have (they're factors, but not complete), but also how you decide to spend your energy with either yourself (introvert) vs other people (extrovert)-both Tae and my best friend spend their energy in both ways, but they lean slightly more to other people. Also, ENFP's (Taehyung) and ENTP's (my best friend) are known to be extrovert-leaning ambiverts or introverted extroverts (at best) btw. Haha this is longer than I expected it to be, but this type of frustration has led me to open more of my experiences back in middle school and college that I was afraid of opening up because I didn't want my feelings and frustrations of being ""misunderstood"" get the worst of me back then, and this helped me relate to Tae and misconceptions of him (""4D alien"", ""dumb blonde"", etc.) by a lot. A lot of people in the comments are also mentioning Yoongi as well and as an introvert that prefers leading by my thoughts and logic more than my feelings and emotions with a ""tsundere"" sort of personality, I can also relate to Yoongi as well with my own introvertness and reservedness as well (I'm kind of similar to him in terms of personality as well)-we can be cold outside the exterior (I actually don't talk to people unless they talk to me first as a fact lol), but to the people we're close to, we can be quite nice and friendly people and caring to an extent (sometimes not in conventional ways). Also, people should remember that on-camera personalities and off-camera personalities are not always the same-while they're not exactly fake, there are times when on-camera personalities are exaggerated a bit or made as an extension of that idol's personality as a way to attract or please fans to the group or even to the idol himself/herself, so people should draw a line between off-camera and on-camera personalities imo, but there are some people who don't and that's where I think the misunderstanding of some idols come into place.

"\^\^\^\^\^ This! I've always disliked the way that people label him as these labels as well. In Korean culture, 4D is supposed to be a compliment for having a unique personality, but the way they have been using the ""4D"" label on Tae is just degrading and insulting to his personality. Same with the alien, it's quite degrading and detrimental to his precious and admirable uniqueness as well. The 4D alien has gone to the point that so many people see him as the ""weird guy"" of the band instead of the truly intelligent and creative person he is, and thus, leads to the unnecessary flanderization and infantilization, even if some of these people are younger and even no smarter than Tae himself. It just literally reminds me back in my middle and high school days when I was made fun of by some of my classmates for my ""unique or weird personality"" due to my social awkward personality (due to language and social developmental delays in my childhood) that I couldn't help having when I was one of the top students (I was the Namjoon in my high school back then) in the class, so I can definitely relate to Tae on this. Also, they really need to stop with the ""TaeTae language"" as well: it makes him less educated and intelligent than he really is and dismissive of his uniqueness as well, and as someone who was diagnosed (or misdiagnosed according to my parents) as ""autistic"" in my childhood due to social and language developmental delays, it not only makes me 100% uncomfortable, but also makes me 100% sure, as someone who stans him, that it makes him uncomfortable as well.

"I was recently cleaning out my Facebook and found this ""10 albums that will stay with you"" list I had done a decade ago. It had Remapping the Human Soul on it, and I thought... huh, that's still valid. It's stayed with me so long already, it probably actually will for the rest of my life too. It's a massive album but really a masterpiece. Map the Soul is one of my favorite single tracks. The lyrics of the Korean version are really beautiful, it's maybe one of my favorite love songs. I attended their concerts just a couple of weeks ago, and honestly teared up a bit when they performed it. I somehow didn't expect it to be on the tracklist. One more thing: Tablo in general has this aura of being this encouraging, idealistic godfather for baby rappers everywhere. But on Pieces, Part 1 there's this song called Ïó∞ÌïÑÍπéÏù¥ (Pencil Sharpener). It always makes me think of Namjoon and Yoongi. The album was released in 2008 when they were 14 and 15 respectively. It's like a gentle power anthem for young rappers, with [lyrics like](  &gt;The thick dreams are the first to fold but remember the first time you touched the mic fill your stomach with passion and don‚Äôt fear Everyone points fingers And tells you to follow the money Even though you look pitiful It‚Äôll be your wings fly sky high your beautiful mind Color the black and white world with your beautiful rhyme in this heartless city oh this godless city you‚Äôre an artist dont lose your confidence in yourself and &gt;In the moments of your life Where the darkness loses its opening Never forget That you become the sun for others I can't help but imagine them listening to this song.

"I've been into BTS for only about 6 months, so I'm no expert. I'll just say what I see, but I don't know how much my opinion is worth. And sorry for the novella in advance. I've thought about this stuff sometimes and wanted to get it out. Maybe others have noticed some of the same things. In terms of the public, I also think Jin and JHope are the most misunderstood. As for myself, I would say I also misunderstand Tae. Or maybe not misunderstand, but still seek to understand. As others have pointed out, Jin and JHope have fun, beagle personalities on camera. But I've read articles that describe Jin as ""quiet"" or ""brooding."" We also know he was very quiet and accommodating for Suga when they roomed together. And Namjoon, very early on, said he'd never known or been able to understand someone like Jin and that it took time to relate to him. I still question to this day what that means, as I haven't come across a clear answer. Jin is the only member of BTS (that I know of) who has a higher education. I may be wrong, though. And he has made certain off-the-cuff remarks about business and finance that make me believe he's more sophisticated than he lets on. He currently owns a restaurant and a flat, and from what I've seen, the restaurant is doing very well and provides good quality to its customers. I also believe he traveled around the world and studied in other places, unlike the rest of BTS, before joining. And he keeps in very regular touch with his mom (and has a song called ""Mom""), and it's said that his family is wealthy. We also saw Jin use expensive cookware from his home in the early days. Given all this, I think Jin may have been expected to complete his education so he'd have a foundation in case BTS doesn't succeed down the road, and I've come to feel like he has one foot firmly planted in the adult, professional world and is competent for his age in that regard. He said years ago his mother didn't praise him in front of friends, and I question whether he had been raised with very high expectations for performance as well as social modesty to not appear socially tacky. He has said that ""your hard work is for only you to know."" But I think Jin also still has a foot planted in the world of youth, so he loves games, toys, cute things, making new friends, and making others laugh. I think he has a very adult mind in many ways, and was raised to be such, but still has a young soul. It's typically the young soul on camera, however. As for Hobi, I feel like he is still very rooted in his family and his familial identity. He's mentioned his father's profession many times, his father's cooking, how his family inspires him, and his song was MAMA. He said he wishes he had learned more about literature years ago, given his father's job. He cried during his family's birthday video to him. And while Hobi often acts silly and loud, I notice that he can also show disapproval or hesitancy when he thinks other members are being too ridiculous. I believe he's very disciplined both physically and in habits, too. He's clean, he learned to rap from Ground Zero, and he's a dancing machine. I think he loves to perform and entertain, but that he also has a domestic, reserved side to him that takes extreme comfort in being with those he loves deeply and knows well. I also think he has a wicked, sarcastic sense of humor that comes out only sometimes, but when it does, you think, ""Dang, that was sharp!"" As for Tae, I've come to realize that I can accurately describe a ton of his traits, but I admit I don't fully understand where he comes from or how he experiences the world. I find him more of an enigma than any other member. I recognize that Tae experiences stimuli, situations, and social constructs in a way others don't, and that he also responds to them in a unique way. What makes this even more interesting to me is that he's completely sincere about it, and you can tell he is not merely seeking attention or trying to amuse people. He just does what he wants to do, and it's natural for him. And yet he also completely knows WHAT to do and what to say to get the responses he wants out of people. He's clever, sometimes in an even scary way. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;",0,4236,785

Tae... who looks like he could walk down the catwalk at any fashion show in Milan and spend his days walking down the Champs Elysees. Grew up on a farm! Yoongi... who gives off a sleepy grumpy vibe so often. Is the one most likely to openly tell his fellow members that he loves them. Also sounds like a professor, or maybe a music executive, when you get him talking about BTS's process, its plans and its dreams. Jungkook... Mr. Tough Guy athlete who likes to punch his fellow members. Apparently sensitive to scents and uses a fabric softener called Adorable. You get my drift. These guys are all far more complex and complicated and human than we could ever imagine.

And then you become a fan and you're like, OMG, he's like BTS personified and super super important part of the group's music, mentality, support structure, goals, and I think Bang PD once said in early days that Suga give BTS its BTS flavor. ",0,527,100
This should be top comment. ,0,28,5
All of them in different ways. People use what members have said and done to defend how they want to portray them to others in fandom. It‚Äôs a lot of projecting from everyone (even me) it‚Äôs mostly innocent but sometimes fans use it to manipulate how others view members to fit and justify their attitude/outlook of the group or certain members. I can see how casual fans or new fans may especially believe certain stereotypes and myths. But longtime fans cherry picking what they do and don‚Äôt want to see is being disingenuous. ,0,527,93
Lately I‚Äôve been wondering a lot about who Hobi is outside of being J-Hope. I also feel like his personality is hard to understand. It‚Äôs interesting to know that other fans feel similarly.

Because 3 years with BTS and I‚Äôm still very surprised at how badly misunderstood Jin &amp; Hobi are by actual fans, especially Jin, with Hobi there‚Äôs like 10% effort by some to actually understand him, Jin not at all it feels like. Both are beautifully human and say a ton with their body language and silent moments than fans allow them to with their words. By newbies, Jungkook is the ‚Äúangry one‚Äù, Tae is the ‚Äúdumb one‚Äù and some fans try to make new fans think Yoongi is the ‚Äúscary one‚Äù, fuck that noise, watch all the old content and nothing about Yoongi has ever been scary, he was a bit reserved and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.

"I think the same thing. He shows his immediate emotions well, (crying, scared, happy about something) but he kind of keeps his private stuff, well, private.

I wish people would be more open minded in understanding Taehyung more, but nonetheless I honestly think people need to more self aware and realize that other people are more complex than the image they portray on camera, he may be innocent and playful in some ways, but he is part of the filthiest industry in the world and you don‚Äôt veer through it being naive.

I did vote out BST and chose Spring Day but Spring Day isn‚Äôt on even my Top5. The fandom generally has an emotional attachment to the song.

"Jimin is a ball of fluff, our mochi, our angel and fairy, the most supportive friend with the cutest eye-smile. But is also our demon and king of duality, just when you settle into the illusion that he is just the cute he throws you a curve ball. So don't let the cuteness distract you because that man is a slytherin (the cutest, loveliest, nicest slytherin but yes still a slytherin). There is also the fact that Jimin has a certain androgynous beauty and elegance to him (especially when dancing) which makes Jimin effect really powerful to the point that gender and sexuality is no longer a barrier and everyone just loves him. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, welcome to the fandom.

Even for people new to the fandom, the most recent material/interviews/shows all have Yoongi being his dumpling self, it's usually older pre-2017 videos that perpetuate this image anymore due to cherry picking videos that show him as cold.

"Hmm I think it's natural for any of the members to be misunderstood at some point, especially by new fans and/or the general public. Some that i can think of at the moment: Jin - it could be easy to misunderstand him as being always confident, never taking things seriously or even egotistical. But in truth, we know that especially at debut he had low confidence, he uses jokes to make others feel comfortable and his 'worldwide handsome' thing is confident but humorous (not egotisical). Suga - as people have already said, at first he can give the impression of being cold and aloof but the more interviews / Bangtan bombs / v lives etc. You watch the more you see that he can be quite soft, he's just introverted, is clear of his own mind and is a music genious. Also has a gummy smile :) J-hope - he is someone i misunderstood at first! He can be very over the top, extroverted and 'in your face'. I have to admit the first few things I watched, I found J-hope a bit much. It was only as I fell deeper into BTS that i really began to admire him as the 'hope' of the group and see his more mature/leadership side. Jimin - i think he can be misunderstood as needy or attention-seeking, whereas really he is just a perfectionist who doesnt fully recognise how talented he is! V - I think there's a quote somewhere from Namjoon, which says V is sometimes misunderstood as a clown / silly but is actually a genius.

"Yoongi as ‚Äúcold‚Äù when he‚Äôs literally the brother that would hold the umbrella for his other brother while getting his shoulder rained on to make sure the umbrella covers his brother. How if he argues with Tae, he would hold his hand. How whenever someone does hi5 he ends up holding their hands instead. Yoongi works so hard when he‚Äôs awake that he sleeps to recharge when he can and it‚Äôs often misunderstood as being lazy bc that‚Äôs all they see in vids. He works on music off camera and sleeps in the comfortable company of his BTS family. He‚Äôs the softest his gummy smile is ü•∫ And Taehyung, the adjectives that still stuck to him till this day are the ones he expressed he didn‚Äôt like. ‚ÄúAlien, weird, strange‚Äù There‚Äôs more but the intention behind those words changed from being cute things during early debut to being mocking bc ‚Äòfans‚Äô still label him as that despite how observant, caring, gentle, and warm he is. His mind works differently and to others that‚Äôs perceived as weird and dumb. He‚Äôs intelligent and worries too much x.x remember the book? He wanted to learn how to communicate better. And Jungkook, there‚Äôs a portion of the fandom(mainly composed of new fans or misguided or just plain rude) that dubbed him as a legit brat and spoiled. The boy started working at 15. He spent his middle school/high school training and honing his skills while others his age were out playing and being spine breakers. He earned everything he got bc he paid for it with his own blood sweat and tears. He‚Äôs good natured, well mannered, and dedicated and passionate and thoughtful and he‚Äôs surrounded himself with good influences in a good environment to grow as a person. He is a fine young man! Yet there‚Äôs ppl that misunderstand/judge him to be brat and spoiled. I wish people would think first before casting judgement on anyone they do not personally know in real life. Especially when it is in demeaning way and disrespectful. And Namjoon. If haven‚Äôt noticed, he‚Äôs the punching bag for everyone in existence whenever anyone decides to target BTS. A young man like Namjoon is a gem. One that learns and grows and doesn‚Äôt shy away from his mistakes. But the thing is, people don‚Äôt want to see his growth. The man beneath, his thoughts are so, soft and soulful and he works so hard and he overthinks so often. He‚Äôs still so young too. And I say this for the whole of BTS, they are good people, genuine people, but other people must first step on them before they give them a chance and majority of the time, they‚Äôre scapegoated and hated on for merely existing.",0,2562,457

One thing that always confused me is that they usually release a ""comeback trailer"" and it's always a full-length song that also serves as the intro track of the album.

I think ARMY needs to open their eyes to this. I honestly accept them giving the older songs a real shot and then deciding that they don't like it because that's only fair. But being someone who is kinda going against the grain not listening to something in a language you understand, how can you seriously be shy of trying new things. I was personally reluctant to listen to old music because it was Hip hop to. I thought hip hop was only about sex,drugs, money, and women. Then I remembered this is BTS. This is the stuff they started out with and I trust them to have quality songs. And if they were able to build their careers on it then why not just check it out even if it really is just about alll those things. I don't care if songs are about sex, drugs etc but it gets a bit tiring. Surprise it wasn't about any of that at all. I looked deeper into what they said about their old albums and what they thought about Hip Hop. I'm pretty sure it was in the video of Yoongi talking about the old albums for 80 minutes that made everything clear to me. Hip hop isn't about hedonism, it's about true expression of oneself. It's about taking your experiances and your thoughts and just having a place to express them. To talk about them. Based on this I think Hip Hop is a huge part of what made BTS, BTS. Their songs are written from the heart with and honestly. That's what I think anyway. ",0,1577,300

"I just barely finished all of my assignments yesterday. It was exhausting and I'm planning on taking a few days break before diving into the remaining ones.

But during the past three weeks I've been doing roughly 5 art pieces/day (not that I would say they were my best work, but still, I made something) and I feel like drawing has become less daunting for me.

"People will get defensive about the shitting or even side-eyeing of a hiphop heavy album because that is WHO BTS ARE (one of their Personas if you please) I don‚Äôt know which music these people were listening to but I don‚Äôt remember the rap line disappearing at some point during LY era. Again people can say they don‚Äôt like their music all they want but these are the same people who will bop to Outro:tear and ddaeng and say ‚Äú I like BTS coz they don‚Äôt sound like all the other sex, drug songs found in mainstream hiphop‚Äù these fans are the same ones they will pray for a rock heavy album but guess what that genre also sings about...yes.. sex and drugs. So there lies the hypocrisy. They never bother to explore hiphop as a genre but are ready to praise BTS as outliers when what the boys are actually just staying true to the roots of hiphop. This isn‚Äôt a case of fans have to like every content their fave releases. This is a good time as any other for people to examine their bias. This isn‚Äôt a case of EDM vs HipHop. It‚Äôs more of a hiphop artist exploring other genres and rapping over said genres but still releasing hiphop tracks. Their older songs are actually RnB and hiphop heavy same with the current b-sides. The only thing that changed is BTS started to release more mainstream friendly title tracks. So if people keep on saying they don‚Äôt like the older songs it begs the question do they really even take the time to learn who BTS are as artists and the artistic journey they have taken to date. How can you even appreciate their growth if you never even listen to their older songs and explore their older eras? I‚Äôm asking this because I have seen people outright saying they have never listened to the old albums and don‚Äôt plan on doing so because they are hiphop heavy. This again is just their bias towards the genre which I don‚Äôt care for...they are no different from people who say they won‚Äôt listen to BTS coz they sing in Korean.

I‚Äôm actually looking forward to the new album coz I don‚Äôt particularly care to dismiss music based on genre but hiphop as a genre has a special place in my life. It‚Äôs about time as BTS does a throwback that people take time to actually check out their older albums and eras coz they ARE important. Even if you have to do it once I would recommend that ARMYs do it. Do that and watch AHL coz some people seem not to grasp how it‚Äôs really beautiful for us to have a throwback to all these eras that have built the members both as artists and human beings.

New ARMYS who joined during the Wings to LY era who keep saying they don‚Äôt like hiphop keep forgetting that BTS has 3 rappers who during those eras rapped over the EDM, rock inspired music.

Suga did the Nevermind intro for theThe Most Beautiful Moment in Life/Young Forever era. J-Hope did the Boy Meets Evil intro to their Wings album.

I'm not really interested in mascots in general, but they are *so freaky* I can't help but love them. If there's gonna be a plot based series, I'd love for that oddness to not be diluted too much.

I would also really love for the show to cover serious topics as well children and adults face alike such as happiness, sadness, love, anger, death, jealousy, infatuation, bullying, being different, animals (pets or not), loving yourself, taking something without asking, etc. and have each character offer their advice to other characters going through a troubling time concerning these subjects through each BTS member's own words from their character. Maybe even explaing what certain objects and events are to the audience if the viewer is not familiar with what the object or events are. \^ \_\^ It would also be really cool if our boys got to voice act their own characters! It would be so much fun to see. \^ \_\^",0,1039,186
You know how after each show BTS holds slogans? Those are part of ARMY Time. It's not funded by Big Hit and actually organized by fans! So fan bases/translators ask Big Hit if they can run it for a date of a concert and once they get approval that's when they open donations. If the donation amount doesn't get reached they either decide to run with it and only give the funded slogans to the front of the crowd where BTS will actually see it or they'll refund the money.,0,471,90

Whenever anxiety kicks in, especially in public, nothing calms me down quicker than a BTS song. Whether it's a slow song or a hyped one. Their voices just make me feel grounded and when I'm anxious their music feels like a big, fluffy blanket that I'm hiding under and that's shielding me from the world. Yoongi's voice in particular works really well for me, so I do often put on Seesaw. Hope you figured out which song(s) work for you and that you're feeling better, OP!

That and the the memes is what really dragged me down the rabbit hole. However it‚Äôs been a while, and I‚Äôve had the chance to look back at the roots and their beginning as a tentative hip hop group. While the genre is not unappealing to me, they just didn‚Äôt seem fully confident in that era. Later, during LY, confidence really shone through, and I think it has the potential to transcend genres. I feel like now, Bangtan can properly and pridefully present hip hop with their own twist, and it would not feel awkward. Honestly their charisma and confidence is what brings the house down, and they shouldn‚Äôt be restricted by genre. I will say, personally stuff like BS&amp;T and Fake Love is immediately immersive for me, most likely due to my own preferences in art( have a thirst for dramatic visuals and music). ",0,953,173

"I think I have a idea about the new album, It's long I'm sorry. In this Comeback Trailer, the black board and the room has Persona, Shadow, Ego, Who am I, Who are you, Dream, Love and Happiness written all over it (this is important later). RM raps about finding himself and others finding themselves ‚ÄòWho the hell am I‚Äô (at 1:40), ‚ÄòDo you wanna die?‚Äô (at 1:43),‚ÄòWhere‚Äôs your soul? Where‚Äôs your dream?‚Äô, (at 1:47) ‚ÄòDo you think you‚Äôre alive‚Äô (at 1:49) ""The 'me' that I remember, and people know"" ""The 'me' that I created myself to vent out"", (at 2:04) ""The 'me' that I want myself to be"". (at 2:23) (these aren‚Äôt all the examples, but you get the point) I believe that Namjoon is saying this because at the end of the Love Yourself, all the members love themselves after Fake Love where they made a fake persona for a girl they loved. But the members never lost their fake persona and throughout the album, BTS will find themselves. Also, I believe that in the Map of the Soul album, BTS will meet TXT and mentor them into love themselves and love their horns (which is why RM says, where's your soul? Where‚Äôs your dream?‚Äô, etc) as in Crown, TXT grows horns on their head and a person with wings (this is BTS) teaches them to love themselves as BTS had just finished the Love Yourself Era they could teach them how to love themselves as in crown, TXT hate their horns and want to run away and want to be saved by the person with wings. ‚ÄúWanna run away, wanna disappear. Far away also, ‚Äúare your wings the same pain like mine‚Äù and ‚Äò‚ÄôSave me, who am I, I don‚Äôt know who I am‚Äù and ‚Äòwho you‚Äô (which I think is refusing to BTS). So, throughout the album, BTS will mentor TXT to love themselves and through other experiences throughout the album they will have multiple experiences and will find themselves and who they are But, BTS will go through problems, which I believe what Map of a Soul: Shadow will be about, but BTS (Probably Jin, because it‚Äôs always Jin, just joking) will fix this. Then BTS will Almost fail TXT, which is what Map of a Soul: Ego will be about, as TXT will have too much self-confidence and develop a huge ego but BTS will stop this and teach them how to not be cocky. Thus, making Map of a Soul: Dream, Love and Happiness, which I believe will be albums to end the Map of the Soul Era were BTS will find themselves, TXT will love themselves and both groups will be happy with who they are.Ôªø ",0,2413,454

Ummmm, some specious lyrics aside, I really did and do like the wild, rough, edgy sound and tones of their earlier work. Emphasis on the ***earlier***. For a little while now, I have occasionally wondered what a more mature, and having experienced the world somewhat, BTS would do with the hip-hop and rap heavy style they originally started out with. Given what the teaser looks and sound like, I would think (hope?) this new storyline/Persona would have a mix of songs with both their debut days style and current style. Obviously, we don't know what-all will be on the new album, but I'd like there to be songs with vocal-and-rap, but if you go waaaay back to their beginnings, all of the members of BTS had some lines of rap. The return of rapper JK? For a long while now, V's been into the rap-line's stuff (if you recall, there's Bantan Bombs of V trying to copy some of the Rap Line's Cypers).

"I understand your points, and I agree to a certain extent. YT reaction videos are debatable, yes. But most of them also helped the fandom gain more fans. Some of these reactors have huge audiences who aren‚Äôt into Kpop or even BTS. Should they wait for 24hrs? Yes, that‚Äôs probably ethical. But, even if they release videos within 24hours I see it as a win-win. Also, I apologise if I gave anyone the impression that I‚Äôm ‚Äúpromoting‚Äù reaction videos.

"Thank you for your visit and kind words! Thankfully though, the focus of this campaign, Kim Namjoon isn't dealing with allegations of being a general asshole üòÖ While a complex issue, the ""But Namjoon"" narrative began around 2013-2014 when said person was accused of 1) cultural appropriation for wearing dreads and imitating hip-hop culture, and 2) flowjacking J.Cole's ""Born Singer"" and Kanye West's ""Black Skinhead"" when the band released [""Born Singer""](  and [""BTS Concept Trailer""](  respectively. It's gotten to the point where for any idea BTS released that shared similarities with other K-Pop groups, much online hate and anger would be directed towards them, and Namjoon in particular. Thankfully, this has mostly stopped but we plan to mobilize and so that we can transform the disruptive force carried by ""But Namjoon"" into an uplifting one. Again, thank you very much for your time üíú",0,896,144
"Exactly! I love their albums, but I got to miss the old kind of vibe, their LY era was feeling it was pop/hiphop songs which were mostly made by vocal lines and the rap was added, it makes sense since Loving Yourself give you soft, hopeful vibes, not like Dark &amp;Wild haha. Old BTS was mostly rap line, and their recent albums were more of vocal line, showing BTS growth in trying different stuff. So... Maybe this time the are showing their balance. Also I feel like, just like many fans knew BTS with LY Era and the ones who were already BTS fans from D&amp;W and previous album must have felt the change too and decided to go on hiatus. Now could be viceversa, but I don't feel they will leave. My prediction for this album is like BTS is reflecting on their old and present music, so they are gonna the mix of this.",0,822,156

In the book we only read each character's POV in diary form, but in Webtoon, it's comic form. I was just saying in the NOTES 1 post how the book gave us more details on the character's background, but I realize that in Save Me, they also tend to give more of a story as well, like that conversation with Jimin and his stubborn mother. I feel so bad for Jimin being in the hospital for so long in solitude. I can imagine how it must feel, because it's a tough situation to be in when even though your parents want what's best for you, they don't think you're well enough to go out in the world, because you are their child. They have a mindset that they can control your life somehow like the way they grew up.!&lt; &gt;!It is sad, though, for parents to act like they don't have a child because he's in the hospital because of seizures...The flashbacks are so curious.

"I definitely see your perspective, and it's a totally valid one too! None of us want to engage in crude fights with another fandom, reference to this section on the original post: &gt;I shall reiterate this with distinct clarity: the intent of this campaign *is not* to pick a fight and/or belittle any other artist or fandom. Rather, we are to use it both as a tool to regain power over a word that has once hurt us, and as a rally of support to Kim Namjoon himself by showing that ARMY is ready to move on from the once-painful narrative with him. I want *none* of us, as a collective to go out and spread malice to other groups. We and BTS have already gone through a lot early on and would not want the same fate to befall any other group. But, in defense of the campaign, the focus is on conveying positivity and support to Namjoon. Our goal is to root him on for taking back the power of the ""But Namjoon"" narrative. Unfortunately, being aware of the current situation that's going on amongst other fanbases, there can be no realistic scenario where someone will take the campaign the wrong way. Let us be there for them while they grieve. Let us help them cope with their loss with empathy and sincerity. Let us clarify that our intent is never to mock or spite them. If some cannot understand that and acts hostile, then I'm sorry to say but we must peacefully disengage, mute and block.",0,1395,259

While we were in line; we met up with another one of our friends who was very eager to explain to me things about kpop, she actually told me that I should NEVER get into bts or exo because they were overrated, their fans were scary, the usual sort of thing. However when I went home that day, the curiosity killed me and I ended up looking up both groups and watching all their mvs and Dope/BST got me in the rabbit hole :"")) &amp;#x200B; It was kind of slowgoing for me where I only listened to their music and was vaguely interested in a few other groups but I remember them starting their wings tour and seeing clips of them goofing around or being cute on Twitter that eventually made me become a full ARMY around the time the first bbmas rolled around :"") I'll always remember sitting with my friend so eager just to see a bit of them in the background.

It's not really fair that all the missdeeds and things that go wrong in that industry are also linked to BTS ... and on the other hand BTS has had to fight hard to get any attantion from their country now they have that attation but still the big companies try their best to stay on top... and downplay BTS hard and make it into a Kpop/Kwave is succeeding thing... ( uff this ended up in a rant) P.S BTS started out to use youtube and twitter heavly because they didnt get to promote much on varitey shows etc. so they started to use those plattforms especially ( and later Vlive ...) that direct interaction from the beginning was and I think still is not commen in that industry as Companys fear that the idols will mess up and want to controll their image etc. of course there are groups that also get the freedom but I think a lot are post BTS ... success ",0,1719,332

Anthony is one of those reactors where I actually really care about what he has to say about a song/MV and his opinion and interpretation on things because you can tell he loves doing research and learning about what some of the songs *really* mean.

It's something new for us to bond on with her becoming a teenager, which I really needed since she's really not into making crafts or watching me cook any more üòï. The little ones really like the song Fire and Mic Drop, now I just have to get my Frank Zappa loving husband in! I'm hoping SNL can help with that! Thank you again I really appreciate it!

"&gt; I remember reading once that everyone was really unhappy during SLA and D&amp;W because the concept wasn't them. Do you remember where :o? Cause I remember them struggling the most when they switched their sound up from D&amp;W to HYYH. There's an extensive interview yoongi and Joon did talking abt their struggles abt identity around this time and how they feel abt going for a more public friendly sound/concept w I NEED U and the flower boy look. Most of their unhappiness w D&amp;W seems to be cause their title at the time, ""Danger"", tanked really hard in the digital charts haha. I don't remember them talking abt the cause being abt the concept tho. Though, they do look like they get hella embarrassed revisiting their looks back then nowüòÇ",0,753,131

"I just wanna put another line of thought here. If we look at all the BTS member's solos or covers or the different mixtapes, ***I think its pretty obvious that the members themselves have different musical taste.*** Not ALL of them are so big on hip hop, specially now. &amp;#x200B; They all have different strengths and after disbandment talk I think they have mentioned several times now how different they are to each and want different things. So while they've done different genre of music in last few albums to show versatility and people say its to please different fans ***I think it was also to highlight the strengths of each member.*** &amp;#x200B; At the end of the day they are a band and a GROUP project even if they started out around one member and in order for the group to continue they need to find ways to satisfy each of the members. I am ALL for hip hop bangtan and I loveeeeee 'war of hormone' and wish it released in recent times so it got more attention albeit with slightly more mature lyrics. &amp;#x200B; But if people are saying their newer albums are more generic or about trying to please everybody, well if that everybody is the members themselves then I don't see anything wrong with it. Because as long as they all stay together I think they can and will cover any genre thrown at them. ",0,1321,239
"They weren't unhappy back then because of the music - they were unhappy about their status and not having the success they wanted. Which is why Bang PD made the change to HYYH sound, to appeal to idol fans more. Joon faced backlash bc of his history in the underground and other controversies. And no offense to your friend, but them's fighting words.",0,351,63

I went back and listened to everything, though. And I love SLA and D&amp;W just as much as everything else they've put out. So, I'm not concerned that they are going back to that sound. In fact, I'm excited. I had a feeling we were going back in time. What better way to fix the past then go back to the first concept and do it the right way? On another level, I remember reading once that everyone was really unhappy during SLA and D&amp;W because the concept wasn't them. RM specifically faced a lot of backlash over his identity as a rapper and an idol. It's a huge power move, in my opinion, to go back to a concept that you weren't totally happy with to revisit and put a new spin on it, so you are happy with it. It also fits what we are expecting this albums main concept to be, persona &gt; what's expected of you from society. Maybe I'm just talking out of my ass and I'm way off the mark. BTS and Bighit likes playing us like that. But I'm excited either way.",0,1138,221

"As someone who doesn't normally listen to hip hop, I am all ears. I'm very open-minded to whatever genre of music they will release (and music in general, actually). It's actually a good thing that they're able to experiment a vast amount of musical styles throughout. I listened to their entire discography a few months back (Aaand I might do it again soon) and I admired how many different sounds they've gone through (and not just each album, *Love Yourself: Answer* didn't stick to one genre, at all!). It shows that they're not going to just stay in one lane of music for every album they make. In a sense it gives them a chance to figure out which style stands out to them the most. From what I took from listening to their discography also is that they never ever left their hip hop/rap roots. But, yeah for someone who never listened to much hip hop, BTS opened up a new type of sound for me, even since the lyrics are mostly in Korean! It's amazing as you would say regardless of language, music breaks down barriers. Like earlier today I gave *Skool Love Affair: Special Addition* another listen and was sucked into that early 90s hip hop world of their since that Persona teaser shared that lovely sound. It makes my heart happy to hear such nostalgia from the teaser. They bring that type of hip hop era into their music and make it modern/present. That's another thing I notice about their music, and another reason why I love listening to them besides. I think based on my novel comment, I am very much excited to hear this potential original Bangtan. ",0,1566,283

"Your experience is the reason I avoided BTS for quite some time. I become obsessed about things I really like. It‚Äôs as if I need to know every little detail immediately. For example I would get a new game. Put in so many hours. Finish it and leave with that odd empty feeling. I would fill that empty feeling by writing and reading fanfics. Reading theories. Watching clips of it. Talk about it a lot. Dream about it. But that empty feeling would always remain because I had already consumed the original content. Like you, it brought me joy when I would consume this content. But I would feel a bit sad outside of that world. And in the end the fanfics I enjoyed were sad ones which reflected my mood and kinda influenced my mental health (and not in a good way) From what I‚Äôve gathered here, a lot of people seem to have gone through the same thing. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs normal though. It‚Äôs far from normal. Being obsessive might even lead to being possessive and that‚Äôs just not good for any of the parties involved. Now a few months ago I decided to finally watch a few bangtan bombs. But because I knew what would happen if I didn‚Äôt control myself, I limited myself. I have watched all the MV‚Äôs but just a small amount of bangtan bombs. I watched a few v lives. I can count those on my hand. What I‚Äôm saying is that the key to getting a healthier relationship with BTS is limiting yourself. Look at BTS and realise that they are just seven guys. Yes they are awesome people but in the end they are still human. You don‚Äôt need to have seen every video. They promote self love. Love yourself because you are worth it. And don‚Äôt do it for them! Do it for yourself. Go out into the world. Take their advice with you but let them go for a few moments. Then at the end of the day, see if there is something new. (Again. You don‚Äôt need to know every little detail. It‚Äôs okay to just be a bit more casual) I think it would be a whole lot more awesome if you‚Äôre a casual fan that takes care of their mental health than being a hardcore fan and bursting at the seams. Sorry for the wall of text. If you‚Äôre reading this I just want you to know that I really want you to feel better. ",0,2179,420

The thing with Bangtan is they usually mix and match a lot when it comes to their songs and albums. If you take any album of theirs you cannot safely place it in one genre.

"I'm kind of shocked. A comment I wrote yesterday about BTS being superheroes matches up with Namjoon's lyrics in Pers*ona*. **Namjoon said this in Persona:** ""I dreamt of becoming a superhero, now it feels like I really became one."" **I wrote this yesterday:** [  **I like them a lot for the same reason people like superhero stories.** Look at hero stories like Spider-Man, Sailor Moon, Superman, Wonder Woman, etc...they are Peter Parker (or Miles Morales), or Usagi Tsukino, or Clark Kent, or Diana. They have their ""real"" lives with their relationships, responsibilities, struggles, rivals, and trivial stuff. Just so with BTS. Jimin is always late. Namjoon breaks stuff. Yoongi just wants you all to be quiet. Jin's ""mom might call suddenly."" JHope shrieks in fear during amusement park rides. JungKook has a collection of luxury lip products. Tae would prefer to not wear shoes (and maybe not brush his hair). But when they're in costume and ""On,"" they perform amazing feats nobody else is performing right now. Like superheroes, we know the lives of BTS members through their social media and shows. Or at least, we know the story of their ""regular"" lives. But when they perform as BTS, they're basically the dancing and singing equivalent of Voltron. They come together to create something like nobody else, and they can do this because they've invested thousands of hours of practice into being excellent at what they do. Watching BTS is like watching Spider-Man swing through the sky, or seeing Usagi Tsukino change from a clumsy schoolgirl into a magical warrior. The narrative of BTS is one of transformation, duality, human potential, and fighting against society's preconceived notions of sex, gender, race, nationality, economics, and class structure. Once you get to know them and their background, you realize their story and ability to entertain are as engaging as anything you can find in Marvel, DC, or manga.",0,1929,316

"I became ARMY in 2014 when they dropped ""Boy in Luv"" (which also had rock vibes that I fell head over heals for), so needless to say I freaked out when I saw the visual callbacks to Skool Luv Affair in the Persona trailer. Naively, I assumed until recently that a lot of fans like hip hop because I've always associated Bangtan with hip hop. But it came to my attention that this isn't the case when discussing ""Outro: Tear""'s low popularity relative to other tracks. Ultimately, I think BTS needs to make the music they want to make. And if that means going back to their hip hop roots, then it'll be wonderful. They're already well-established in the West by now, so I hope they were comfortable in expressing themselves while crafting this next album. Also, the Rap Line is criminally underrated and people need to remember that the Rap Line is the entire foundation of the group, as well as being the three first members of the final lineup. In a way...if you can't accept their roots, then you can't accept them. ARMY is so huge and diverse now that not everyone is going to resonate with every single track and I think we just have to be at peace with that. And their message and lyrical themes are always more important than the genre they're framed in. I have confidence that true ARMY will give the music a chance because of that.",0,1339,245

Also, bts in general are very diverse with their genre. You can have variety of genres from one single album even from their old ones so the fear of alienating new fans bc of their potential return to old school bangtan is doubtful imo. They may have a hiphop or r&amp;b heavy title track but im pretty sure their bsides will offer something else. Hopefully. Whatever genre it may be, im pretty sure it will be of high quality regardless. ",0,625,118

I'm perfectly fine with this album not trying to please everybody. I think Tear kinda suffered a bit for that so I hope they keep this album more consistent. That being said, there's always a little something for everybody in their albums so i'm not worried about it appealing to the fanbase as a whole",0,561,103

As for the gp,considering Mic Drop is one of their most successful songs in the western market and among the gp and radio,I think a hip hop album would do amazingly well.The gp is really receptive to hip-hop.It would also set them apart from other popular musical acts because of their genre-hopping and ability to pull everything off while remaining true to themselves and their style.",0,976,168

My favorite albums from them are DnW and Tear - which are across two separate era's but what I like about both is the seamless blending of different music types to create great songs!

In the podcast interview with Murray Stein, he said that we all have many legitimate personas ... because we automatically adapt ourselves to the different roles we have to take on in life. We just naturally mirror the role models we see. But there are also times when we work too hard and change/mold ourselves too much to fit expectations. So what is the essential, core 'you' that underlies all of your personas? How do you learn who and what you really are? In order to know, understand and love yourself? And live an authentic life that is right and healthy for you? To start ... You examine (1) your past, the person you were at many points in your life ... (2) all of your influences, people and situations that have shaped you and ... (3) all the roles and archetypes that make you.

I'm glad I'm not alone on the old man/bully section, it was so specific and loaded! Now talking about it maybe they are just symbolic of their foes but also who they could be, like JK is always fighting men like that but how easy would it be to become it, and same with Tae?

But doing different things allows BTS to reach a wider audience and it makes them happy. Also, a lot of people attribute 2013/2014 to the ‚Äúhip hop years‚Äù but those albums were a mix of genres and more complex then people are giving them credit for.

"I don't know if it's ignorant of me, but I typically don't spend much time thinking about the gp reaction. I believe that when they make their music with sincerity and create the way they want to create, it will continue to appeal to people. Of course I love seeing them soar and reach bigger audiences, but for me it's more enjoyable to see artistic growth. Good art doesn't always appeal to a big population; they may end up doing something that doesn't appeal to the masses but has artistic merit and is true to what they want to express. That will always have its audience and that's what I personally prioritize. I'm *slightly* apprehensive about calling back to previous work too much. I much prefer exploring new territory instead of endlessly re-examining the past. Some artists turn inwards to fixate on past successes and do-overs as kind of a swan song. However, I have trust in them to keep doing it in a way that helps them evolve, so I'm still on board this nostalgia trip we've been on for a while. There's really no sign of stagnation in it. Anyway, their albums are always a good mix of sounds. I'm here for all the ways their interests are evolving and expanding. I'm sure the upcoming album will be another interesting bag of things too. I'm a rapline hoe and prefer their bangers/hiphop tracks, I'm probably good based on this.",0,1347,241
"I'm really excited, both because I'm a huge hip hop fan who adores Bangtan's earlier releases and really wants to see them dip into that style again with more maturity and all the skills and knowledge they now possess, but also hip hop is definitely the trendy genre where I live so I think the reception here at least will be great. If anyone who isn't a hip hop fan is feeling a little disappointed or nervous that they won't like this album I think that's okay. Just remember that BTS has a huge discography and they aren't done making music yet. They love to jump genres and try new things so it probably won't be long before they're releasing stuff that's more your taste again, and until then there's no shame in listening to the albums of theirs that you do like. I know there's often an expectation that if you stan a group you should love literally everything they ever release, and sometimes it works out that way, but sometimes it doesn't and I don't think you should be considered less of a fan for that.

"Dark &amp; Wild is one of my favourite albums so I would be SO. STOKED. if they actually did something similar for this album. I‚Äôm a huge hiphop/r&amp;b fan so I actually have a slight preference for their older stuff and the more hiphop leaning tracks of the LY era albums. They‚Äôve gone with a more public-friendly sound with the last era and I think they‚Äôll keep going in that direction. But I have a feeling they might try to blend some more of their original sound in there. I mean, I really don‚Äôt think whatever they‚Äôve got cooked up will be that big of a departure, not enough to alienate a lot of people anyway. I have faith in their production team lol, they haven‚Äôt let us down yet, IMO. Holy shit I suck at expressing myself, how do people do this",0,757,143
"I am excited. I wasn't a hiphop fan before BTS but they made me appreciate hiphop to the point I checked out other artist and their work. We still don't know for sure if the plan on going full og or not but I am excited either way. Even though it's old school bangtan, it's an ungraded version, it has the polish they have now and the great lyrics but still the fun they always were. I think the GP will get to experience another side of bangtan and will come to appreciate them even more. I have this theory which I hope is correct but I feel that with this comeback and era they are just not discussing our map of soul, they are also making Bangtan's map of the soul musically so I think this album will be their 13-14 era, and the shadow will be hyyh and wings era like and then the last ego will be ly era like. So this theory is correct then the newer fans who don't like hiphop much will have their era soon enough. There time will also come.",0,948,188

I'm ready for whatever bangtan throws at us and even if i'm not too fond of the title tracks (DNA anyone), i learn to like it and know that other tracks on the album will appeal to me because come on: BangFreakin'Tan.

D&amp;W is their best album, SLA was also one of the best, those eras also had a lot more cohesiveness and explosive energy and I think it will be Awesome to have that with their maturer and more confident selfs!!! Koreans know BIL, when you see new Korean reactors / fans listen to those eras they thoroughly enjoy them, so I don‚Äôt think a hybrid of that era will go badly with them. As for the west, idc what they think, as music is stale and repetitive and if that‚Äôs what they want, they‚Äôll pick it regardless of what BTS presents. What I need to see is ARMY a 110% behind this album and the direction they are taking. I personally have many issues with LY era, especially Tear / Answer and have come across a ton of people who don‚Äôt really feel it as well, but we‚Äôve supported them completely and found put silver linings in all of it and I hope the same is done this era. Pls none of the crap with shitting on DNA for example, that was ugly and gave fodder to antis, don‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs disrespectful to BTS and just plain nasty.

So yeah, I would probably just instantaneously combust out of pure happiness if they include some more throwback. If they do, I'm not too worried about the reception. In Korea, hip-hop and rap has been very popular these past couple years, and in the West it's also become very mainstream. Not to mention, western critics love versatility, so BTS switching up their sound a little would probably be well received. ",0,695,123

"At around 2:00, he starts rapping with his head and eyes up. Then you see the titan with him. At that point in the song, he starts saying ""me"" in almost every line, and directly making statements about himself, rather than questioning or bitterly recalling the past. Also, the titan is in a robe, rather than clothing, which is a metaphor for purity or nakedness (they can't depict a naked RM, whatever fans may want....). He bends down and looks at RM with curiosity and leans forward for a closer look. I think the titan is Namjoon observing RM. I don't mean to get too philosophical, but it's said philosophy is the study of the mind studying itself. In terms of perception, every person has their ""version"" of every other person they know, and then their ""own version"" of themselves, which is separate from every other person's version of the same person. Robed, naked Namjoon (his actual mind, or self-awareness) is studying himself, and the RM ""himself"" is speaking back to the Namjoon studying and perceiving RM.",0,1019,177

"Two hours later and I've finally regained (some) composure and gather my thoughts. I was not ready for this. At all. 12AM Korea time Thursday meant 8AM Wednesday where I live, and that's basically the time my day officially starts. Fortunately it's my day off from work today, so I am able to fangirl properly. ;) I was just thinking yesterday about how it's been *that kind* of week for ARMY as far as new releases goes (MATTEL dolls, first look at UNO cards, ""Crying Over You by HONNE feat BEKA, RM). And I pondered since they didn't air an episode of RUN, it felt like an eerie anticipation for what will come on the next day, Wednesday... Which now led us to this trailer. They really come at you with a punch, don't they?! It's my first official comeback, and I'm still reeling from everything from this video. My Twitter feed right now has been flooding with observations and theories coming true. But I'm feeling so attacked, because Kim Namjoon is my bias, and, just, damn. Everything about this near three minutes trailer was so visually perfect, so well executed. I love the nostalgic, throwback feel of it; that early 90s hip hop that I grew up with. It's also strange even for a short video, it makes you think about who you were in the past versus who you are now. I'm still figuring out who I am and what I want to do in life. I think even the older we get, we're still a work in progress, no matter whatever trials and tribulations we go through. I'm forever grateful for BTS entering my life at the time they did, and I'm very much excited for what's to come!! I just need to manage my time during this comeback for the next few weeks!",0,1651,307

"alright, ladies. Lessgedit. This is the classroom-turned-storage room, right? The one in the very begin of the Trilogy that ended with Wings and as well as from the book. Where the BU babies first meet. Also took a screen shot of the writing on the wall and on the board. Persona, Shadow and Ego as well as Dream, Love and Happiness keep popping up. Does this mean that the next rtfs of this trilogy are called Shadow and Ego? Perhaps Dream, Love and Happiness are clues to a title track? A quote about dreams: ‚ÄúThe dream is the small hidden door in the deepest and most intimate sanctum of the soul, which opens to that primeval cosmic night that was soul long before there was conscious ego and will be soul far beyond what a conscious ego could ever reach.‚Äù - Carl Jung There is also: ‚ÄúI am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.‚Äù - Carl Gustav Jung With *happened* and *choose* crossed out. There are more Carl Jung quotes but I can‚Äôt make all of them out. The above two are the clearest on the right hand side of the board. There‚Äôs still there left hand side that I can‚Äôt see too well. If you guys remember, Jung‚Äôs work was put on the BTS Big Hit store when they began selling books. Jung‚Äôs work seems to be the basis of this era, just as the work Damien informed the Wings era.

Well I‚Äôll start with intro skool luv affair since this song samples it and what am I to you. Also [Tomorrow ](  is a fan favourite for a reason. Since you like Tear, well before there was Tear, there was [Cypher part 3](  which if you watched the armypedia event you will know that it‚Äôs like army‚Äôs favourite hype anthem. The video I linked was a kcon fan cam so you‚Äôll know how crazy it is that they performed a random b side from a year and a half back and everyone knew the lyrics. Also, it‚Äôs not talked about that often but before there was Hope world, there was [1 verse](  Other similar songs would be we on and intro 2 kook for skool If you like their crazier songs, [spine breaker](  is really good and it also has a hilarious bangtan made home video. I also like look here and second grade; I think I will just recommend the entire dark and wild album. Another crazy but educational one would be paldogongsang (satoori rap) which actually inspired an upcoming variety show. If you like their softer songs, people seem to like Just one day but my personal favourites are rain and like. I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm trying to keep it minimal so I don‚Äôt overwhelm you but honestly I would say just give all the albums a go just one day when you are free.

RM made me realize this in one song. (like wth man) i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because i‚Äôve had past history with them? or if i just understand what it is that they‚Äôre trying to convey. whichever it is, i‚Äôm really here for it. personally, i think that when they said it‚Äôll be a more ‚Äúorganic‚Äù album/sound this time, they maybe mean a mash up of their old sound &amp;amp; their present sound? their sound from back then, kind of improved on &amp;amp; polished with what they‚Äôve learned since then? regardless of the hodgepodge of feelings that are running through me at the moment, it‚Äôs still at face value, an AMAZING song. (you are welcome to feel otherwise, music preference is subjective) but it‚Äôs definitely going to be a fan attractor. a.k.a be ready for another influx of new fans (this isn‚Äôt new really). the video was attractive, visuals were great, i can see it aging well as well (this is when you hear it again at a later date, it‚Äôs even better) &amp; as always, his delivery is perfect. my husband always says he swears he knows korean when RM raps, because you just really do understand him.

I‚Äôm Korean American, never really got super into Kpop and my mom would always go on about BTS and why I couldn‚Äôt bring home a guy like SeokJin so I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I was drawn in to burn the stage because I was so used to the K-variety shows with the subtitles/sound effects/replays and had never really seen an ‚Äòintimate‚Äô or ‚Äòreal‚Äô looking docu about Kpop stars. Their authenticity drew me in. Then I stayed up until 6am not working and watching a billion more videos.

"rest assured, I was shaking and ~~heavy breathing~~ not breathing at all and tearing up when I watched it at 12:01 kst BUT reddit was down so now I had time to process everything so I can deliver you my thoughts calmly, dear fellow ARMYs. ok so what the fuck namjoon. the sound is oldschool yet high quality and funky and catchy at the same time. lyrics are (based on yt subtitles) hitting me hard and strenghten my wish to be like namjoon, my idol, my role model. only thing is the biblical references, not sure what to think about those hmmm. visuals tho, he's so confident, so grown up, so so *so* SO beautiful, I basically screenshotted the whole MV and sent it to my ARMY friend. his eyes, I tell you... and it looks like he's wearing Visvim style clothes, it feels very casual Joonie but THEN at 1:52 he's casual hip hop RM and \[rest\]. btw love the animations, same as txt's ""crown"", good job bighit. if the album will be oldschool, hip hop bangtan but polished and evolved and visually modern... *whispers* maybe...

"I am not sure what you actually want to talk about but if it's your feelings about the song then I would advice you to wait a bit and let it rest. Hype backlash is a thing and there is also the fact that all of us have made all these predictions and perception of what this comeback could sound like and when it doesn't sound like how we in-visioned it we get disappointed even though it's humanly impossible to satisfy every vision of every fan for any artist. So if you are overwhelming and don't know how you feel then I suggest you take a break, both from the Internet and from the song. Don't think about it and give it time and comeback to it when you feel like it. That will help you judge better.",0,704,138

I feel like it is a much lighter spring-y vibe than his sadder and deeper stuff from mono, but still certainly in the iconic rm style. The MV is sooo chill, and not too overproduced like a lot of recent mv's of theirs has been imo. Also loved the cribbly effects they used, sort of the same thing as in the TXT video, but in a different style. Can't wait for the album!!!!! ",0,563,111

Sheesh but the stressful part of all this is that I just need top spill all this out somewhere and my reddit just wasn't working for like half an hour, of all the times to not be working it chose just when I video was released. But now I can finally take a breathe",0,761,151

The animation and the song are timeless and should have been experienced by more people when they came out. Bangtan was always so good, and the sample holds up STILL! The rap is autobiographical poetry. It's introspective, questioning, challenging, and vulnerable. And Namjoon ends his rap with telling the world that he just wanted to comfort us. I had a very strong emotional response to this. I also love the rock guitar throughout, the titan Namjoon, and the throwback to the classroom. In this one video we have both the origins of the Bulletproof Boyscouts and the titans they've become.",0,691,117

"The most recent era just ended in August. As you can imagine, we're all somewhat hyperventilating as it draws nearer! The eras are: School trilogy: Examining (and often critiquing) different aspects of school life. They had a lot to say about the Korean educational system and class inequality (3 albums) Dark and Wild: More of a hip hop sound, a lot of reflecting on society and who they are as burgeoning artists (1 album) The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Examining the transition in your twenties from youth to adulthood. (3 albums) Wings: Reflection of oneself and dealing with struggles of greed and temptation, loosely based around Herman Hesse's novel Damian. Each member also wrote a solo song about their individual struggle (2 albums) Love Yourself: More narrative. Follows the various stages of love, ultimately ending in grief and realizing that the only true love is self love. (3 albums) Map of the Soul: Upcoming!!!! It looks like they're going to follow the progression of the different parts of Jung's book Map of the Soul. There are also Japanese albums (mostly existing songs translated into Japanese with a few new original Japanese songs thrown in there) and unofficial songs released on their SoundCloud. Sometimes they fit in with the era, sometimes they're standalone, but they're all beautiful nonetheless. I think it may have already been mentioned, but three of the members have also released solo albums (one of them has released two) which are all masterpieces. Each era has a very distinct sound as well, so I'd say pick one that appeals to you and listen through with one of the recommended translators :) ",0,1639,274
"It's funny because I *always* read comments even if it's just a quick glance and for all the complaints about BTS fans spamming comment sections, I don't recall ever seeing them mentioned until that day so afterwards it was a shock to realize we actually are in almost every comment section.

I personally feel like for kpop idols, a big part of the appeal is also the personality; they almost never just sing, dance , rap, go to award shows and take some interviews, they also regularly go on reality TV shows, game shows, talk shows etc that showcases as many sides of themselves as they can. Maybe it's because many people find that to be more endearing and hence more intriguing in that sense? ",0,515,94

"All my life I only listened to rock. I had heard of people reading Anime or watching k-Drama, but I'd always pretty much laugh it off, saying I could never imagine myself getting into something so culturally different. So when my friends started brainwashing me into liking BTS, I was very prejudiced against them. But after a couple of months I gave in and watched a few of their US interviews, which made me appreciate RM's high IQ. And then I watched their MVs and realized how hardworking they must be to achieve such results, and also how they really seem to be working as a team, which differentiates them from the much more selfish Western artists. &amp;#x200B;",0,668,118

It had a good beat and one of the members looked so good in the video and I watched a few more but couldn't identify the hottie in subsequent MVs. Was surprised they changed their looks so frequently and drastically. Did some digging and got interested in how they made themselves so available through videos etc but have since found that to be super common in the kpop industry, ruining the uniqueness of that experience. Watched an expose doc on kpop and then felt bad for supporting the industry. Now I follow this sub and their twitter and call it a day. A lot of mixed feelings. ",0,650,118

"There lyrics are actually one of their biggest strengths, and yes your are correct to assume that genius isn't a good source for there lyrics. These are some of the trusted fandom translators-     There are also some video which break down their lyrics like   for bapsae   for satoori rap. There whole discography is available in spotify except for the free songs the release which are on soundcloud and predebut stuff which are kind of everywhere and nowhere. For songs I suggest checking out Singularity, Stigma, House of cards, Serendipity, Lie, Rain, let me know, Fake love (remix), spring day brit rock version, Run, butterfly for starters. For lyrics I recommend songs like- bapsae, dope, no more dream, n.o., tomorrow, spinebreaker, satoori rap, hiphop lover, Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, moving on, whalien 52, ma city, nevermind, young forever, fire, wings, reflection, first love, begin. awake, mama, am I wrong, spring day, you never walk alone, paradise, 134340, anpanman, the truth untold, trivia:love, answer love myself.

"Just go through each album starting with the most recent. The albums are themed, and make sure that you use lyric videos or read translations if you don‚Äôt know Korean. I like the Suga and Spice channel for album overviews and general intros to BTS, though it is less active now. [General intro to BTS‚Äôs music](  includes part of Love Yourself era): My favorite BTS albums in order: 1. HYYH (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life):Young Forever. This is compilation album of the era that launched BTS into stardom, has a lot of classic BTS songs like Dope, Fire, Baepsae, Save Me, Butterfly, etc. Theme is the transience of youth and the struggles of entering adulthood. The only song that I really wanted in this compilation that‚Äôs missing is ‚ÄúNevermind‚Äù but you can listen to that separately. 2. Love Yourself: Answer. The compilation of their most recent era, following the arc of love gained and lost, followed by the journey to slowly learn to love the self. 3. Wings. About the loss of innocence and temptation, based on Demian and the Bangtan Universe stories. This was also the album that grew their international popularity, especially the title track:MV Blood Sweat Tears. I personally enjoyed Wings more visually than musically, but I do think that Blood Sweat Tears was their best comeback to date. The expansion also included ‚ÄúSpring Day‚Äù which is one of their most popular songs. [Solo mixtapes/albums](  RM - RM raps over different beats to discuss him coming to terms with both his rapper and idol sides Agust D- Suga tells his life story, confesses his experiences with depression and fame Hope World - JHope offers us bop after bop while telling us about his thoughts on his life and how far he‚Äôs come Mono - RM‚Äôs most recent album, basically therapy in music form ",0,1778,307

 The following are the best translations you can find- They not only translate but also provide cultural and linguistic references to the lyrics because Bts esp the rappers use a lot of wordplay and cultural and social references unique to their experiences:      ,0,264,42

"I'm on mobile right now and for some reason it's not letting me post links, so bear with me here   often does in depth translations and has entire posts to explain a concept.   Not exactly translations, but this channel will give background information about some of their songs. BTS tends to get very political a lot, and some may get lost in translation   are also accurate   - again, other accurate lyrics I'm also aware of papercrowns on Twitter posting correct lyrics The problem with BTS is, they will oftentimes purposely give a lyric multiple meanings, which can make it difficult for any translator to know which would be the best one to use. Also, they work in eras, which is different from most Western artists. They'll release a set of albums around a particular topic or theme, or even a narrative story, as was the case with the most recent one. One song may not seem like much, but when put in context with the remainder of its era, gives it a LOT more meaning. I'd also recommend the rock versions of fake love and dna, since you specified you like rock, along with the unplugged version of young forever. ",0,1122,200

I would also suggest spring day, I know you said you‚Äôre not interested in the video but I would suggest watching it with the song just for the lyrics because half the beauty of the song is it‚Äôs lyrics (BTS can be quite poetic).

But I saw you list the genres you like listening to and I see you like lyrics and there's def many songs that you could enjoy in terms of lyrics, but for me, a good starting point imo is their Dark &amp; Wild album because it's a good mix of hard hitting and slow songs and some good lyrical content as well. Like Intro: What Am I To You is a pretty hard hitting song by their leader RM. Can You Turn Your Cellphone Off while a bit more pop-ish has a great message about technology and friendships. Rain is a bit more ""bluesy"" and has a melancholy/lonely feel to it.

"I once had a crush on my professor who was a solid ARMY. Not everybody knew about him being an ARMY, so I was gushing when he only showed me his music library full of BTS songs. And so, I started looking into them and watched their videos. I watched Not Today on its release (my professor posted it), and though I loved the video, I didnt instantly become a fan. Fast forward to a few months and the BBMAs voting happened. I kept seeing them on my timeline and so I decided to check them out again. (Sadly, I'm not seeing my professor during that time because I'm taking different classes already.) Then I just got hooked. Binge-watched BST, Fire, Not Today, and Dope. Like on repeat. Now, I'm a solid ARMY as well. And no, I dont think my prof knows that I'm a fan now and that he's one of the reasons why I became one.",0,820,159

"So I'm not an expert in this, but I read [this chapter](  once and the way it defines parasocial interaction requires ""a sense of copresence and mutual awareness (Campos-Castillo &amp; Hitlin, 2013). In a parasocial interaction, users intuitively feel personally addressed by the other (although they are not, because the other addresses a mass audience), and they experience the seemingly social encounter as reciprocal (although it is not, because it is one-sided or non-interactive)."" I don't know if this is the generally accepted definition though. However, the author also points out a phenomenon labeled 'parasocial processing' which doesn't require a give-and-take, such that ""parasocial processing captures all (social) responses of users that set in as soon as they perceive a mediated other, even if they just observe the other but do not feel observed by the other"". So maybe things like empathetic responses to news stories would fall under that category? And this all certainly seems related to empathy. Research seems to show that people with high empathy seem to form tend to develop stronger parasocial relationships than people with lower empathy.",0,1165,182

"I remember i watched one of those teens react to kpop videos (i'm not sure if bts were in the vid i watched) and i didn't look into it further than that. Then in 2017 i decided to use my dormant twitter account to see what happens on twitter and i saw a hashtag trending about bts and the ama's. So i was curious as to who they were and decided to search them on youtube. I just assumed if a non-english speaking boyband is performing there must be something more to them than just their looks, i was curious as to what it was. I got hooked on their music,lyrics and performance but what i really remember appreciating is their maturity when it came to their craft. Also with all the performances i watched i was impressed that there wasn't one obvious ""it boy"", they seemed very balanced and i couldn't see a weak link. Also at the time a lot of the interviews that came up were done in America and i wanted to find interviews were they were a little more comfortable,which led to me looking for more content...i kinda also just wanted to know their names...oops. Interestingly enough before i knew about them i had been wondering when an artist from Asia ,that doesn't perform in English, would become i guess ""mainstream"" or be taken seriously in the US and twitter was like ""Do you know BTS?"". I didn't have any preconceived notions on k-pop and i liked that their lyrics were more than the typical boyband just talking about a girl, which while i don't really mind those songs either it was nice to see variety in the topics they write and perform about. It's kinda easy to appreciate them if you look at them without prejudice, even if you don't end up becoming an ARMY. &amp;#x200B;",0,1689,312

"At first I only knew DNA(I don't remember why) it was my guilty pleasure but only because of the choreography because I tought it was freaking cool even if the music wasn't my style. I remember that one of my friends was listening to music with her sister, and her sister played Fake Love and my friend told her to change the song, I asked what song it was and she said ""that Korean boys"" and I said ""Oh I know them but I don't really like them, I'm not interested"" months later the Idol video with Nicki Minaj came out and oof I swear if it wasn't for Nicki I wouldn't have clicked the video. I remember Namjoon was the first who caught my attention and at first I only wanted to learn their names and to differentiate them but I ended up watching all their mvs, watching meme videos and by the first week I was already a hardcore fan, specially when I came across Spring Day, that song made me fall in love with then, but I was intrigued by their personalities also. It's funny because I totally refused to listen to them before, but their music is really powerfull. They are the only K-pop band I'm interested in. ",0,1117,212
"My friend was showing me music videos and clips of this Korean group, and as I make him put up with nonsense I like all the time too I was a good sport and watched the videos. I wasn't a big fan of the music, though I was impressed with the production, and I liked how goofy and cute the members all were interacting with each other in clips and videos. My friend gets all pumped because they might win a billboard, and I keep tabs on twitter while it's happening because I sort of like them and even if I don't vibe their music really, I can tell they work hard and it's a big deal to them to get recognized. I even find the short speech by the one guy who speaks English to be endearing. Anyway then my friend links me Mic Drop remix when it comes out and I am absolutely addicted to the beat and the whole thing, it's like a visual treat, and whenI figure out how to turn on lyrics I'm tickled by the bragging song of these dudes who just won an award. I listen to this one song on repeat long enough that I decide to buy it. Except oops, the version I got on iTunes doesn't have the killer intro on korean that I liked so much, but there's another version that does on some weird album that's pretty cheap, so I just grab the whole album. I didn't actually like it a ton at first aside from Mic Drop, but the music grew on me, and my friend kept showing me more songs I'd like. A month later I bought Wings bc I had been hooked on a few more songs. I showed my sister the BST MV because I was just amazed, and she asked me if these were My Boys, and did I Stan? I had no idea what she meant. It was a slow descent into insanity and by the time I realized I was in too deep my friend who hooked me had sent me a Koya cushion from the Line Store opening day. I honestly didn't want to accept that I'd gone full fangirl at first, I told myself I was too old for this sort of thing, but the more I listened and watched and read lyrics the more connected I felt, and I found myself rooting for them whenever I'd hear they broke some new record. I slipped all the way down the slope from ""oh I just like this 1 song"" to learning fan chants for a concert I'm traveling to alone and planning a tattoo like please send help I still don't know how this happened.",0,2256,456

Bighit just doesn't have that influence and connections just yet, BTS only started registering on the korean media's mind just last year, it takes time to build connection and influence.

At that time I was super into music in other languages so it would‚Äôve been *so easy* to make me a fan but seriously nothing caught my eye. I discovered BTS on my own a while later. Said it here before but the lyrics of Dope amazed me. I imagined a whole story of working professionals escaping during their break to show their pride. Then I got hooked on the HYYH universe and theories, and by the time the WINGS short films came out, I was as deep into theories as you can get ;; A month later, I thought it was natural to get into other groups, so I started watching videos of two other groups. For one of them I liked their personalities, but their music honestly sucked, and for the other one I found their videos a little boring.

I honestly don't see how charting high in Korea would be beneficial to anyone if it does not correspond with the ability to make money from the recognition the way Bangtan does. Everything gets sold out and that is anything each member touches or endorses not just the most popular members as with other groups and I have a feeling TXT is going to be capable of doing this as well, they are such a cute and adorable group u can't help love I predict great things for them.

Mommy!‚Äù He was so excited and his face fell so hard when he realised it wasn‚Äôt real. In another prank they made him think he was on his way to the airport to see his mom.

I then saw the thumbnail of BTS's song 'Not Today' and wondered what it was because it looked interesting. The second I started watching it, Namjoon's purple hair and the choreo (especially the triangle formation and their feet movements) sold me. Afterwards, BST came up in the suggestions, thought the name sounded interesting and clicked on it, and before long, I realized I spent two hours looking at their MVs (sigh) üòÇ In short, I came for the choreo, stayed for the relatably funny personalities (especially Mr. Worldwide handsome)",0,824,142

"I have heard of their name and my friends are actually pretty into them. But I only listened to DNA before and could never understand the hype and I just blindly dismissed them as ""overrated"", ""I don't get why these guys are famous"" etc. Until some time last year I was suggested I Need U from a music app, the artist was Èò≤ÂºπÂ∞ëÂπ¥Âõ¢ (Bangtan Sonyeondan in Chinese, I had no idea it was BTS's full name). I loved the song from first listening to it, the first two verses by Suga and J-Hope already hooked me, which is rare because I don't even like listening to rap. But this is different, it's like... Rapping out a melody? I don't know XD. Fast forward a few months, I started listening to their songs on a Spotify playlist, I came across Boy In Luv, I loved Fake Love and Mic Drop as well but at that point they were just catchy songs for me. Then I came across Dope and the music video...when Jin's part came on, my heart totally melted. (Insert J-Hope's: oh my heartue is.... My heartue is... Oh my god). Did it make sense to pick a bias before I even stanned the group? XD I was just like: what is his name??? (Excuse my fangirl moment) I also remember replaying Dope many many many many times because it's just so damn catchy. What really got me into BTS as a group for good was when I started watching those fanmade crack videos, I didn't even know their names but they sure are funny. Then I started watching a couple of BTS run clips. The point is, I didn't feel like I was just watching them doing what they were doing, it's like I'm there with them getting to know them during the process. Every one of their personalities is real, distinct and raw. I was pleasantly surprised that they also don't have the ""we are superstars"" kind of vibe at all, they are humble, well-spoken and on some level very relatable. I always felt that the more relatable someone is, the more inspiring they can be, and BTS really inspired me on many levels till this day.

I then started descending into the rabbit hole at first cautiously and then falling deep at an alarmingly fast rate.

I just want to say: don't be toxic and shove this in YG stans' faces and don't treat this like it's official either because the sharing of this is clearly biased. I'm also kinda skeptical because of reasons other users on the internet have pointed out; bighit doesn't have that many artists in the first place compared to the well established artists in the ""big 3"" but it doesn't mean the world that they don't have a ton of people if those select few are making so much money.

"Well, profit wise bighit is definitely comparable to any of the big 3. But having a bigger roster does give a bit more stability which the other company's do have. Like in SM's case, even without EXO (due to the coming enlistment) and Shinee they still have groups like Suju, TVXQ bringing in huge amount of cash from their tour and sales. And this is why YG was suffering a bit last year, he just doesn't have any group that is big enough to compensate for big bang. Blackpink are pretty big, they have the largest following among the new YG group and their sales prove it, they also have public interest like any other YG group and have great digitals but they are still not big bang big. Maybe in the future blackpink will become that big (it's definitely possible given their hype and popularity) but not now. I think Bighit will have a similar problem when BTS will start enlisting, TXT are pretty big as rookies but they are not BTS big, so I don't think TXT can completely support Bighit while BTS is gone.

"I thought ""Big 3"" status had as much to do with the connections those agencies had within other Korean media organisations, broadcast networks, brands etc that allowed them to keep a stranglehold on certain jobs, opportunities and guaranteed media coverage, as it did the recognition of their groups by the Korean GP. Bangtan kinda bypassed a lot of the accepted strategy for getting known (no acting jobs for members in 3 years now, not much appearing on non-Run/BV variety shows, no solo non-musical activity for anyone since 2017 I think? When did Jin go on that Jungle show?) so I don't know if Bighit has built those connections with the regular media so far. I mean, I believe they have some kind of arrangement with Dispatch but that seems to be it so far.",0,763,134

"Hear me out, this one is going to sound a little strange. I want Jungkook to sing (and possibly rap because I enjoyed rapper JK) on a collaboration with japanese rock band One Ok Rock. One Ok Rock originally had a lot of rap with their songs but they moved away from that sound when their gutarist/rapper left the band. JK cited OOR's ""We Are"" as one of the songs that he enjoyed previously. Alternatively I want just a JK x Taka of OOR duet. This would never happen, but I want a Jin x Yoshiki rock ballad collab. I think Jin can do some serious rock ballads, and no one writes an orchestral rock ballad like Yoshiki Hayashi. On the western collab front, I want an Rap line x Mike Shinoda collab. Here's why-- I see this as a western rap collab that would actually have both English and Korean rap (rather than the automatically-expecting-RM-to-rap-in-English thing that has been going on in Change and Champion). I think Mike Shinoda would be totally cool with them rapping in Korean. So Mike can rap in English, Rap line can rap in mostly Korean (with the hook in English), and it would play in all da clubs. Since I'm just missing JM and V at this point, I want a duet from just the two of them. I loved their harmony in the last part of Fake Love, and want more of it. ",0,1274,241
"I am a bit uncomfortable about CJ's continues rise and take over, some people tend to forget that CJ is bigger then all of Big 3 put together, they are a conglomerate, one of the 5 largest company of whole south korea and seem to be constantly buying other entertainment company which makes me worry if they are trying for a monopoly of the kpop world. Even SM's beef with CJ and mnet is because they tried to interfere with SM's music distribution and mess with it. I am always been a bit uncomfortable about CJ and Bighit's collab but I realised that Bighit just isn't big enough to actually oppose CJ so maybe they kind of entered a compromise to preserve itself if CJ is actually aiming for that monopoly. It's also why I don't want Bighit to do a IPO soon because CJ is definitely going to buy a shit ton of their stocks.",0,826,156

"To be honest, I think that me being a big anime fan back in my tweens really helped with becoming more open-minded in terms of accepting music/cultural exports from other countries - however I did have this grudge against kpop fans and ARMYs in particular because I hated seeing them everywhere in youtube comment sections. Because of this I swore never to be an ARMY (lmfao - look how that turned out). It was a very, veeery long process though. Fast forward to 2016 and I saw the Blood Sweat and Tears MV, and from then on it was me slowly falling into the fandom.

"Thank you for sharing your thoughts, first of all. No, none of this is ""weird"" behaviour. After all, the idea of weirdness is just some concept others have formulated to label people who choose not to fit their mold. They use weirdness like a weapon. But you? You have strength. Just the act of reaching out and sharing these thoughts with us is already strength in its purest form. I went through the same pains you're going through right now, believe it or not. Instead of BTS, I fantasized, dreamt and hoped for friends in the form of characters from an old PC game, Grand Chase. I had no real friends as a child. My father tried his best to make my living conditions better, but he couldn't fix the daily barrage of insults and bullying that went my way. I was different. I was an outcast among my society. I think differently, with abstract thoughts that dived deep into the complex and the philosophical. But I couldn't share them with others my age or older with the fear of being labeled as ""weird."" No one could understand my words, no matter how much I screamed for them. Whenever I wept, the teachers would distance other children from me because I was ""an attention-seeker."" Beyond my dad, I felt no love from the world. One day, I began imagining ""what would it be like if the Chase were my friends?"" Day-by-day, a new member would enter my conscious thought and keep me company. Lire, an eleven archer, became my moral guide and conscience. Jin, a fighter from the Silver Knights, was my motivator to keep living another day. Ronan, a magic-wielding knight, was the one whom I could express my deep philosophical observations with and we would bounce off our ideas to each other during my sleepless nights alone. There were many more Chasers; each member provided me another lifeline and another friend. Sounds silly, I know, buy it was because of these friends I had, I was able to overcome my extreme loneliness and lack of love and empathy from others. The Chase became my safe haven as a child. With their help, I began to use reason over my impulsive emotions, caused by years of trauma. I grew out of my shell and developed more confidence because of whatever support they gave me. I began to have friends, *real friends,* again. And while my situation in life was still shittier than the gutters, I wasn't alone anymore. I had both the friends inside of me, and the friends around me to help pick me up. I managed to stay strong and last long enough until I was given a fresh shot at reinventing myself in a new country: Canada. There, I took the lessons I learned from my past life and from the Chasers and began to really, truly find myself in a new land. It's been almost a decade since the Chasers have greeted me to say hello. Since those times, I have finished high school with flying colours, gained many new friends for life, but most importantly, found the answer to who I am and what my purpose in life is. I haven't found all the solutions, but I learned to love myself, at a time when no one else loved me, through the help of my old friends. BTS will help you fight your day-to-day battles. They will guide you, comfort you, and help you grow. But I urge you to reach your hand out even more. Try your best to get in touch with someone who you can trust and talk to. Even I had to utilize a counsellor, which helped me a lot growing up. You have the strength, the power and ability to change your circumstance for the better. Find your allies, those who will love you unconditionally and whom you can love unconditionally back. Don't stay silent; speak out! Oppressors find those who stay quiet as weak prey. Take action and fight back! You're not alone. If you have bullies, find your friends. If you don't have friends, rely on your family. If your family doesn't have your back, reach out because there *are* and *will be* people who will. You have BTS. You have us now, here at  as well. Don't be afraid to talk to me or any one of us here if you have a problem. We're here for you. You matter. You have potential, no matter what anyone else says. We love you. You never walk alone.",0,4120,760

When I was first listening to them I wasn't super impressed, but when I listened to songs like Baepsae, Pied Piper and Paradise I was surprised at a) how fun the songs were and b) how deep the lyrics were (as cliche as that is). \- What they represent: it wasn't supposed to be them to get this big. It was supposed to be a bigger, prettier, better group from a big company with more resources. They resonate with a lot of people ""it's not supposed to be."" A journey many can relate to. \- Entertaining and likeable personalities. Also openness and vulnerability in what they've said and their music. \- Superficial but also important: great performers. BigHit also does a good job coming up with and executing concepts with complex story lines, aesthetics, themes, etc. It all comes together in a cool way. In general they're very good connectors - from their music, their personalities, their dynamic, their lyrics, their words. They can connect. And to many they offer hope, encouragement, and something to relate to. &amp;#x200B; Hope this helps! ",0,1178,202

In the context of T.O.P from Bigbang being caught smoking weed, it was his friend‚Äôs drug use that busted him. That appalls me, to be surveilled to that extent. I feel so sorry for what happened to T.O.P. Myself and most of my friends are queer, and in our mid twenties one of my best friends who is very flamboyant and typically queer in appearance but always maintained he was straight (to the point of faking a crush on me) sat me down and told me, his voice full of shame, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been lying to you for years. I‚Äôm actually gay‚Äù. I told him it was obviously totally cool and I didn‚Äôt see it as lying and that it changed nothing about our friendship. I come from a traditional Asian background and only came out to my family in my early thirties. And my friends and I exist in a liberal, metropolitan western city and are part of a large radical queer community and were STILL closeted for years. Under the kind of pressure and scrutiny that BTS are under, I think the tight circle of trust amongst the 7 of them (I think it really helps that they‚Äôre able to share this insane experience of fame together) must be really helpful and meaningful. But god, the scrutiny. Always having to have good skin and be gorgeous and smiley. Having to look good at the airport in front of hundreds of screaming people, when everyone feels like shit after a sleep deprived 18 hour flight - even when traveling first class.

Can‚Äôt remember which MV I watched first but I remember being hooked by the time I watched fire because of 3:33 ;) Only experience I had with kpop prior to that was EXO, I even remember seeing the overdose MV on a german tv channel when it came out, but I barely noticed it was in Korean I just downloaded the song and continued with my life.

"I think you're so right about the format and length being right (not overwhelming as it could have been) ... And they've also made good choices for the webtoon. The bloody content and the repetition, in the latter, needs to go somewhere but it would never have worked in a video or in a book. The writing team have made excellent choices. I agree again that a bit more humour would be helpful. In general, its a BTS strength so it would be a nice relief to have more. The idea of them all going off to battle their own demons (and learn their own personal lessons) is a good one (and it could give us more solos! somewhere down the line) ... as long as, yes, please dear god, may they also learn to communicate with and help one another !!! If you think about it, each is on their own, individual quest of self discovery and maturing hopefully towards health and happiness. But they're also a group/unit and potential team who could do much better together than alone. I like that there are very symbolism heavy videos and the webtoon that are more fantastical than the more realistic videos and the Notes book. And I love how dividing things up like this could give them a licence to get even more fantastic and magic if they want to. They have all kinds of demons and a fairly wild array of archetypes to explore so why not get more comic/webtoon-y in some timelines. I made a joke about their becoming ninja time travelers on another thread but I was (shhh) only half joking. [The Not Today mv starts with a fiery psychedelic ?wormhole, continues with them fighting for dreamers and ends with them linking arms before we see the wormhole? again at the end ...] And Jung's hero and jester, magician, old wise man ... there are so many ... could be great masks and directions to go. Anyway, you're much better at reading symbolism than I am but you just convinced my to look harder now I'm on a second reading.

How in the Wings concept leak his pairing with the members read Inner | Outer.

So basically there was a theory that the stories of the seven can be combined, Inside Out style, to form one narrative of maturation. How? There were different takes. [The Bangtan Theory](   was probably the most advanced of them all. It hasn't aged well, but it is an ARMY theorist classic, so it may be an interesting read for history's sake. ",0,742,130
