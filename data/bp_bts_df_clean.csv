this is something i can get behind and appreciate  seeing blackpink expand their sound and experiment with their music color and genres is something that i ve wanted to see in anticipation of their future music  i m glad they didn t decide to play it safe and go for a similar sound to their  square up  album and more edm focused house style from their square sound  this is at least for me  i primarily listen to purely hip hop rnb neo soul  blackpink and bigbang are groups that i listen to outside of my lane  what they do with their sound makes it easier to digest different genres of music for me because of their hip hop  trap influences  at the same time  they re the only groups where i m willing to open myself up to different genres of music because of the quality of the music  i wouldn t even think about k pop if i were to listen to it for the sole purpose of listening to a single genre of music  whether the reception is poor or not  which i highly doubt it ll be poor   i m going to enjoy this experimentation to its fullest  ,1,1043,188
hold the fuck up   rock songs  i m considering skipping class tomorrow now ,1,75,12
what time and date is this in pdt  0 am is a bit confusing as i don t know if it s april 4 or 5 in kst lol,1,106,27
is there a list  last year i remember they streamed all the acts the first weekend  ,1,84,16
as a blink i ll wait till mv dropped  then i ll stream it on all my devices  full album i can check at any time  but help to others 1 time in a year ,1,149,33
pretty much  just refresh the page and it should be there,1,57,11
you can expect some of them to have a more mellowed out rock that leans more towards rnb  there are a ton of ways to do rock  nonetheless  i m very excited for the release  ,1,173,34
\[selling\]  2  blackpink tickets   allstate arena in chicago 04 24  amp  x200b  ga floor w  soundcheck \  selling for face value  amp  x200b  dm for details    ,1,161,25
almost all of them are rock songs  i was thinking maybe one of them would be a  stay  type of song ,1,99,21
if ros  actually comes out with a guitar for these  rock songs  then i am done  i am telling you that  pls yg  d super excited for it  i won t be surprised if this ep will contain their best song yet  and that would be quite the feat tbh,1,237,49
dead  track 1 is rock hiphop track 2 is dance rock track 3 is rock hiphop track 4 is rock ttack 5 is hiphop according to weibo,1,126,24
i meant why is there no livestream for them,1,43,9
well i probably won t wait either  but i also will buy the album so it s fine imo to listen to it before it officially releases on spotify,1,138,27
i was planning on justifying it by buying the album either physically if we ever get one  or digitally if we don t  but i like your idea better  thank s for the tip ,1,165,32
can you imagine  legs for years  decades  centuries ,1,52,8
for square up i used a vpn to make an asia based spotify account  works fine and supports bp instead of random uploaders   ,1,123,23
the album won t drop for me until 13 hours after the mv release  no way i will be able to wait that long  i m starting to like this staggered release less and less  but hopefully it helps the numbers  blackpink to the top baby let s go,1,235,46
i don t think you can speed up the video to trick the youtube algorithms  here s a [guide]   a fansite made on how to stream properly ,1,134,25
i am definitely going to wait for the vlive and mv release before i listen to any new song  after that i am not sure yet if i can wait another 7 hours until i listen to the other songs or if i will try and find them on youtube for example   cest  probably the latter  d ,1,270,57
uhm  i believe youtube doesn t count views if you put a video on loop  specifically for that reason  you d have to click replay every time for it to count  but i also heard youtube counts a view after like 30 seconds of watching a video  please correct me if i m wrong tho ,1,273,52
it just boils down to lack of information from official sources   insert classic yg meme about how awful he is at handling this stuff  but i guess at this point all we can do is wait and see what happens,1,203,40
here s what s happening according to [variety]  ,1,48,6
i ve never bought an album at release  what do i do at 12 am est  just go to itunes and spam refresh ,1,101,22
where did ros  s knees go    ,1,29,6
to me  it s confusing because the us doesn t have a standard time  there are 4 different  standard  times  it is very unlikely that it would release that way but there hasn t been any clarification  all we have is kst  then release within each time zone  it makes sense to me that it would release at est  trust me  i m not fighting you  i m just saying that the statement is confusing  i ve never encountered a release like this  ,1,431,77
i think youtube consider it as a spam when u loop a certain video  better to clear your browsing data when streaming,1,116,22
11am tomorrow,1,13,2
1st week livestreamed  2nd week curated material ,1,49,7
the tweet  after translation  so maybe room for error there  says  however for overseas markets  digital tracks will be released at each country s standard time   4 5 0am   based on that and how every other music release at least in the us has always been  it s very unlikely it will release for each time zone within the same country ,1,335,58
the reddit post i commented makes it sound like each individual time zone  same with the twitter comments  i thought it was weird too  there s definitely some confusion but the way you are saying makes more sense  but there has been no official response about this  ,1,266,46
i think there is some confusion on what  each respective time zone  means then  normal you see a music release say  12 est  but in this case it doesn t say anything  most of twitter is saying that it s 12am in each time zone  which i thought was weird too  but there has been no official response about release times  ,1,318,59
wow i just came back from a similar post in the kpop reddit and people were just plain negative over there about this teaser but everyone here is all happy  the contrast is unreal,1,179,34
only for the mv though  the album comes out at 12am in the timezones for each country  so for example  in the us it s out at 12am est  that s for all of the us  not just the east coast  so for cst it would be 11pm on 4 4,1,220,48
that s always how music in the us works  it is based on est  they don t base it on individual time zones within the country  for the us it s always just 12am est  so 11pm cst  and so on ,1,186,38
i ve never seen a music release in multiple time zones across the same country  music services serve the entire country not individual time zones  plus it says each countries respective time zone  so the first time zone to hit midnight in each country  so 12am est  11pm cst  9pm pst  at least that s how i see it ,1,314,57
wait so their performance won t be lived streamed until second week ,1,68,11
now just wait for countdown ,1,28,5
right click the video  there is an option for loop ,1,51,10
could also mean day minus 1,1,27,6
so we can watch bp live,1,23,6
why though  ,1,12,2
ego makes more sense than what i read  which was egg  ,1,54,12
how do you loop on youtube  also does it count for multiple devices  like if i use my pc  my laptop  and my tablet does that count as three  or would i need different accounts  ,1,177,35
bp  currently  isn t in the list for live stream artists       hope that changes ,1,81,16
hell ya hell ya hella ya,1,24,6
that doesn t make sense that the album would drop at 11 pm cst  it would come out at 12 cst  unless they are releasing in the states based off of one time zone  est or pst   then that s when your comment would make sense  according to this post  it s 12 am in each time zone  ,1,276,55
i m really going to love this comeback huh  amp  x200b  i love their looks so much  if fits them well  ,1,103,19
album will release at midnight in each respective time zone  so midnight for me mst  midnight for you cst  so on    mv is the one that s being released everywhere midnight kst  so for me  mv will release 4 4 at 9am  ,1,216,40
i wish hahaha,1,13,3
11pm tomorrow night,1,19,3
it s korea time which would be about 10am in central time i believe ,1,68,13
 zooms into picture of organ ,1,29,5
thank you for that  ,1,20,4
same  can t wait  ,1,18,3
countdown link   ,1,17,2
btw there s a countdown option below,1,36,6
if i guess an announcement about the physical ep will come tomorrow  it could be a nice teaser before the m v drop and probably a good way to keep that stock price stable  like you say though the most important thing is that we are getting new music  i m so hyped  ,1,265,51
speaking of military  d 1 could also refer to the french char d 1 light tank ,1,77,14
for some reason  as a huge jisoo stan and even bigger bp stan  the new song didn t surprise me as much as dddd    the lets kill this love part seems weirdly high pitched and girl for the girl crush concept judging from the teaser  and it seems like they will reuse a gun choreo but change to a massive machine gun or something this time  hope to be pleasantly surprised though    ,1,380,72
memes are not allowed anymore  for the second time  go to  or post them on the weekly discussion thread ,1,104,19
could you tell me what is the live counter  i am interested in youtube algorithms  but don t quite understand it yet  ,1,118,21
i don t get why they push jenny so much  especially in the international market   obviously lisa is the goat of blackpink and jisoo is the prettiest and best girl goes to rose  ,1,177,32
my first blackpink comeback  only one day left  yes    ,1,55,9
lol   i translated the song introductions and posted them in the chatroom    but it is still unconfirmed info so maybe it is wrong too,1,134,24
youtube only deletes views from the live counter which are not quality views  that is also the reason they freeze views  any legit view will count  there is no trolling  this is their way to make sure that they can make money  to be able to give quality control to the companies which buy ad space ,1,298,56
yeah i believe this is from weibo as the song genres are already out for each track  ,1,85,17
since my dumbass cannot wrap my head around time zones  can someone tell me when this comeback comes out in cdt ,1,112,21
yeah  gt  700  lt  is great tbf polling data for elections only generally uses  gt  around 1000  lt   at least in the uk ,1,121,19
 praying to the kpop gods as we speak ,1,38,8
yeah i absolutely feel you there  don t lose hope just yet  especially with this amazing concept  o,1,99,17
i think it drops at 4pm  with the countdown live beginning at 3pm  god bless these eu friendly times  thank god they didn t do it at 6pm in korea ,1,146,29
i had the same question  thanks for asking lol ,1,47,9
 gt either way though  imo most important is the fact we get new music anyway  true true  i m just a bit sad that there hasn t been any notice yet  i want my blackpink album photocard collection to grow   gt   lt ,1,213,36
is this video filmed for c blinks  as jennie said  thank you  in mandarin at the end,1,84,16
yes   thank you   ,1,18,4
there was a thread about this yesterday    have fun at the concert  ,1,68,12
jisoo is killing it with that pose,1,34,7
24 hrs to go omg im so hyped ,1,29,8
the visual assault continues  as always the pinks looking fiiine  can t believe in less than 23 hours we ll officially have 13 songs y all   ,1,141,24
well seems there is an album as the members themselves have just said it themselves  so i guess later this week or next week   ,1,127,24
it s happening   ,1,17,2
what time does it drop at gmt ,1,30,7
well i just don t think it would make any sense all things considered  didn t jennie say in an interview that they shot for the album pics  also the digital copy people get in the us for concert tickets  i think that would have been phrased differently  then i think i saw some article which said there will be 2 versions  just overall it would be so weird to not have a physical release when square up did so well  i just cannot see it  now i cannot tell you why there wouldn t be any news of it yet though  with preorders  etc  that is a big mystery to me as well and it certainly points towards no physical release  i will give you that 100   if they don t address this tomorrow then i ll be on your side as well though^^ either way though  imo most important is the fact we get new music anyway ,1,799,154
this should have a game of thrones tie in  i mean  it has trumpets  a queen  and slaying  pretty much game of thrones  haha,1,123,24

i wouldn t be surprised if we get some details on physical release tomorrow  for a release next friday  have faith i believe we will be getting one  ,1,149,27
no it actually drops in 23 hours  that is why they posted this as well d 1  one day left  d ,1,92,20
i very much doubt that there won t be any tbh  it is definitely weird that there are no news at all yet though  i d hope to get some info regarding that tomorrow during the vlive  or maybe even a teaser in like 8 hours  we ll see ,1,230,46
it is a military term initially  d day 8day of the attack   d x where x is the amount of days till d day ,1,105,21
they keep it spaced out so that all comebacks feel like a first for us  yg really cares about the fans ,1,103,21
2 days to go   ,1,15,4
work  what s wrong  me  4 girls ded me,1,38,8
so excited  ,1,12,3

wow i think that already makes up a reliable pooled data    ,1,60,12
it s tomorrow in the west  right ,1,33,6
i m so excited  i m literally going to be watching the music video until the album drops for me  also  it just hit me that i ll be seeing this song live only like a week and a half later  what is life ,1,201,41
i long for the days when they ll give killer heels for chaelisa too ,1,68,13

cannot believe it s almost here    it still feels so surreal  can t remember the last time i ve been this excited about a music release  i am so ready    ,1,154,29
pretty hyped but at the same time i was really really hoping to get some physical album details now but no   sadly there goes all my hopes for a physical album    i m pretty sad tbh,1,181,35
yup  i m gonna love this  these friggin outfits are killing me  i think they re more personalized  and therefore better than d4  i feel like they re sorta keeping the regal vibe of d4  but personalizing it like in whistle  ,1,223,37
screw my wig and scalp  save my soul ,1,37,8

how many people have done it so far  little teaser   ,1,53,11
i m not gonna lie this is what i thought the actual album was gonna be  ,1,72,16
[original post]  ,1,17,2
jisoo always look sexy and adorable at the same time ,1,53,10
[pic]   of her in the vid  so beautiful   ,1,42,9
yeah  that embodies black  badass outfit  and pink  delightful posture and smile  ,1,82,12
i like how her outfit is so badass but her posture and smile is soo delightful   xd,1,83,17
her eyes literally can kill us    ,1,34,7
ais uses the same green tick as yg does haha,1,44,10
first m v teaser now this  content overload  ,1,45,8
dog bless them one and all ,1,27,6
we got one,1,10,3
ur right it won t matter in a teaser   but in the full version if it s still in d minor i ll have to pitch 4d down a semitone ,1,126,28
this will be great for her career advancement  ,1,47,9
woah nice compilation u bk1155 ,1,31,4
i think maybe just increase the pitch of the 4d parts to regular and it would be fine,1,85,18
i think i need an ambulance    ,1,31,7
im not ready i swear,1,20,5
honestly another unnamed sub think mvs are shot over 3 weeks or something and never close to the comeback date   and they also think yg hires non professionals who would struggle to put together a mv   seriously so toxic over there  it s k pop industry  it s obvious they will have top producers for their mvs ,1,310,54
i bet this song will be somewhat like dddd with  soft  and  mean  parts  black and pink ,1,88,17
see u later was already my favorite breakup song of 2018 lol  the lyrics are just so savage,1,91,18
people hating yg i understand completely  but i don t understand the constant hate towards bp  it s true that they re not the most talented stars in the industry currently  but does that mean that everyone who is not the best at singing dancing rapping deserves getting hate  ,1,276,44
epic boss that 1 shots   ,1,25,6
it s me   lmaaaoooo i ve never really realized how addicted i am to blackpink so i thank you for making it obvious op    ,1,121,23
i m a jennie bias  but it seems ros  will take all my attention for this era ,1,77,16
it s the blackpink apocalypse  ,1,31,4
yeah  i hope they re actually singing on the chorus and not doing the sing talk shouty thing some pop songs do ,1,111,19
lisa in d4 wearing glasses rapping in front of the board  lisa in ktl wearing bedazzled lab glasses   she is surely getting her phd end of this year   ,1,151,29
that pose already is the iconic blackpink is the revolution  like they did in fy ,1,81,15
[source]    amp  x200b  caption  getting ready to  kill this love   in terms of supporting the queens but just wanted to claim that nobody can dare to harm jichuuuuuuu love   may god bless jisoo and continue to protect her through our prayers     [\ blackpink]   [\ jisoo]   [\ killthislove]   [\ our]   [\ will]   [\ protect]   [\ our]   [\ god]   [\ bless]   [\       ]   ,1,374,51

well that s one way to get hyped in the morning  i m ready ,1,59,11
addictive music and picture quality like hollywood blockbusters,1,63,8
and its at 89  upvotes so its getting hit pretty hard considering it has 1 6k upvotes  haters can t stop em,1,107,20
the post on  is only at 89  upvotes too lol  people really do hate bp   yg,1,74,17
anyone notice what s written on the license plate of the car  i read  ego  ,1,75,14
no i don t think so  one mv teaser should be everything already  the others are teaser videos which are not mv teaser  so there are two of them per day,1,151,30
what s that sub problem with bp  honest question   this looks very promising  one of bp biggest strength is high quality  luxurious mvs  i predict this will attract a lot of new curious persons  especially after coachella ,1,222,37
hell yeah we do  hopefully spotify gets it up on time  a lot of kpop often isn t  even from the big companies,1,109,22
i love them sooo much  i m so excited to see her with that hair style  it s probably my favorite on her  ,1,105,21
seriously  badass jisoo and badass ros   i wasn t ready for that   ,1,67,11
you have to understand that the main 3 big labels are warner  universal and sony  they have a bunch of sub labels that they own  if you re one of the big artists in the us canada and even uk  chances are you re signed to one of them  but all it really means here is that that s the label distributing you  that s about it  anyone can work with anyone they want  but yeah it could also mean nothing as the other commenter said because they may just like the group ,1,463,88
mv production reminds me of bigbang mv somewhat,1,47,8
so pumped now for their performance there its gonna be so epic ,1,63,12
so one more teaser today  they had 2 per day,1,44,10
i always love jennie s reactions  like she wants to bite you or something ,1,74,13

i cannot handle my feelings right now ,1,38,7
i got my bp tickets for 22  but then again  i bought two and with the fees 71 ,1,78,18
ok everything was hype x10 until i heard the  let s kill this love  chorus line and i just think it sounds    soft  like it sounds sung by young girls and doesn t have that rude bitch meanness to it that i was expecting if that makes sense  hopefully it just sounds soft to me out of context and in the full song  it d be a proper banger  but that s my very first impression as of now ,1,385,74
i got mine for 300  but i m chicago,1,35,8
i m kinda scared about the direction is going  it ll probably be polarizing but hope they make it interesting and not turn it into a bling bling kind of song ,1,158,29
1st song on their coachella performance with lots of flags  horns  smoke etc,1,76,13
imagine this song being their first song in their coachella setlist     ,1,72,12
fasten your seatbelt  i thought bp s hype with their february us visit was over the top  but this april should be nuts        new music   coachella   us tour        yikes ,1,171,36
omg these are soo cute   ,1,25,6
is this their bang bang bang ,1,29,6
i was literally just doing that  too  lol,1,41,8
hi everyone  i got the blessing of the mods to post this  so hopefully we have a solid response  i shortly after tickets for the la concert were available whether people wanted to meet up  i know many were coming in from out of town and people going to the concert solo  there was some pretty solid interested  so here s me following through  this is a short questionnaire to see where people stand in the meetup  feel free to ask questions  i hope to meet many of you soon ,1,474,89
it s genius really  instead of splitting the streaming between m v and music services  one part of the world can be dedicated to streaming the m v only    ,1,155,27

fair point  i hope you re right about that   ,1,45,8
it s so goooooddddd,1,19,3
i don t think so  but they ll take down full album videos ,1,58,11
this teaser is so crispy  i can just hear that delicious crunch  ,1,65,12
holy sh t   i could die if i watch their mv and they re overflowing with so much charm and swag  these are boys weaknesses like mee   ,1,134,25
i can t help but playing in 0 25x  and screenshot almost every frame ,1,69,12
i bet love is not the only thing the girls will kill this friday,1,64,14
when the bass drop it s another banger ,1,39,7
it feels like this is after they hit me with that ddu ddu du  ddu was their promise  this is their delivery  it s like  they warned me  but i wasn t ready   ,1,157,31
i died,1,6,2
wow i am really not ready for this,1,34,8
i wonder if we will see in increase in fancam takedowns now that umg is involved   ,1,83,16
i m ready to die for this war ,1,30,7
they all look so good in their solo shots   and they re bringing back the guns      hypeeeee    ,1,96,16
my phone is glitching and pausing every second but like ty you re doing my work for me  ,1,88,18
38 5 hours ,1,11,2
lol i don t wanna watch  i ll watch it after i watch the mv,1,59,13
god damn    i had my expectations high but so far holy shit    lisa    all the girls looking expensive and badass in this  as people are saying i m loving the militant sound they got going  with the blackpink revolution salute and everything  but the mv production looks awesome     people in another unnamed sub were saying it would rushed and all that but so far it s looking great to me,1,389,68
i just know that they ll yell a  blackpink is the revolution  ,1,62,11
that s like the hardest thing i ve ever heard   and that s just a teaser ,1,73,12
i will not survive this music video or comeback at all  i m so scared and excited at the same time  they look amazing  god i really hope i survive that mv ,1,155,31
immmmm dhdjjdjsj i am living for the styling         they all look soooo amazing        i can t contain my excitement omg,1,121,21
im ready to be destroyed    ,1,28,6
this is gonna be a banger  just a few more days  ,1,49,11
this is going to be a slapper,1,29,7
goooosebumps  i am so excited i m barely functioning through this week   that said tho  i ll always be on the fence about trumpets in songs cause they can be a little cheesy  especially with a drum trumpet combo military sound   but i know i m going to love it anyway cause i m biased i just love everything they do  and we haven t even heard the full thing yet so i can t even judge it yet  ,1,392,73
i had my expectations set high but this still blew me away  the set and outfits look amazing  the beat is great and assuming that part is the chorus  it sounds like it s gonna be extremely catchy ,1,196,37
all of them can kill me and i wouldn t even mind,1,48,11
i wasn t sure about the trumpets on first listen through    then i watched it again   lt 3333333,1,96,16
also guys  did you see ros  with that ponytail and her move   already iconic i am telling ya  d,1,95,19
now that s a teaser  ,1,21,4
to be honest  after seeing the individual trailers i was very discouraged  i was disappointed by the paper taped to a wall moment and basically a video of them standing there looking at the camera  but this    this is greatness,1,227,36
i really like the use of the trumpets and the outfits are killer  but this sound bit sounds a little forced and so far idk how i feel about the beat  now i really want to see the song   mv ,1,189,41
[blackpink coming through for soty]  ,1,37,5
the trumpets wow chills,1,23,4
i ve already replayed this like 10 times i am so not ready,1,58,12
one can say whatever they want about teddy  but he really is the 5th member and i am loving it,1,94,20
let s kill this love          ,1,30,4
i screamedd my family thought i was having a heart attack ,1,58,11
ahhhh i am so excited    it sounds amazing    i love the energy  amp  attitude already   ,1,89,15
yoooooo holup  wtf  ,1,20,3
im so ready for this,1,20,5
well i m going to love this i can feel it in my bones,1,53,13
omg the visual explosion  they all look so good       ,1,54,9
my skin is so clear now after listening to this teaser what will happen when the full song is release i don t know if i m ready tbh,1,131,27
sounds so militant epic,1,23,3
omg  it s here  their anthem     ,1,33,6
omg this is gonna be such a fucking banger  the styling looks so damn good  trumpets intensify and the choreo definitely looks fun  i can t fucking wait ,1,153,27
holy shit they are not playing around    wtf i can t wait for this ,1,67,14
oh man  my heart is racing,1,26,6
not sure how i m feelin abt the trumpets but knowing teddy it ll be a bop regardless  i m so excited  ,1,102,19
the horns the hooooorns   ,1,26,4
i almost have an hearth attack caused just for the excitement,1,61,11
don t mind me  currently smiling like an idiot because this sounds so good,1,74,13
teddy and blackpink are just that magic combo  also am bald ,1,60,11
haha totally the same  i wasn t ready  o,1,40,8
holy fucking shit i actually got goosebumps  i am beyong excited for this now wow,1,81,15
this sounds so good  ,1,21,4
excuse me  amp  x200b  i don t think i m ready,1,46,8
holy fucking hell  beyond my expectations seriously ,1,52,7
legit got goosebumps from this,1,30,5
i ll have to wait 17 hours after new zealand buy the album damn lol  i guess i can just stream the mv until midnight    ,1,120,25
better promotion than yg lol,1,28,5
any blinks from hawaii want to shallow in pain with me,1,54,11
i d love to see them on the voice   big stage and huge primetime network audience  what i noticed about their appearances on colbert and gma is that smaller stages didn t suit them well  they re awkward to dance around  hope they do kimmel  big outdoor stage  around coachella and snl  only for the prestige  when tour comes to new jersey ,1,339,60
yge teasers   black woori bank   pink,1,37,8
that s kinda surprising  considering that albums usually drop at whatever time when it s 0am kst  it s the first time i see stuff like this tbh,1,143,25
i d imagine there will be a lot of copyright takedown notices by umg on youtube  ,1,81,15
100  there will be a physical release but the date is still unknown  ,1,69,13
they want a full week of tracking on charts like billboard hence the staggered digital release  ,1,96,16
it ll probably be released across the usa at the same time like any normal release  so midnight est ,1,100,18
dont you ever get tired of sucking yg off,1,41,9
mmm that s disappointing but still better than not getting the album until 5 a m  est  6 p m  kst   i d always rather stay up late over getting up early  and at least everyone gets the title song sooner  via the mv   that s what i m most excited for  so it ll hold me over until the full release ,1,296,55
blackpink is the revolution,1,27,4
thanks  please report it next time   ,1,37,7
so how do i get a digital version of this for south africa  i don t think many people still have dvd or blu ray players   ,1,122,25
i must also resist playing the mini album sampler ,1,50,9
omg this makes my heart so happyyyy,1,35,7
how true it is i don t know but  blackpink\_bar  the chinese fan base twitter page  are saying that there will be a physical album  apparently they have spoken to somebody  they refer to this person as album agent  as they are supposed to be selling copies to chinese fans i imagine they have  people on the the page seem to trust them so who knows  i would imagine we will hear something tomorrow if its happening ,1,415,76
stream the mv all day at work lmao  try to contain myself and not listen to the album until it s officially released in the states  it s going to take a lot of self control and i m already using that to eat healthy so  we will see how that goes lmao ,1,250,50
i wish i could watch it with people who also like k pop but my uni doesn t have a k pop soc,1,91,20
i hope so too  yg surely wont drop the teaser on thursday since that s technically the same day as the m v  getting real exciting now  ,1,135,25
how true it is i don t know but  blackpink\_bar  the chinese fan base twitter page  are saying that there will be a physical album  apparently they have spoken to somebody  they refer to this person as album agent  as they are supposed to be selling copies to chinese fans i imagine they have  people on the the page seem to trust them so who knows  i would imagine we will hear something tomorrow if its happening  ,1,416,76
check out  asianthing_official for more,1,39,5
check out  asianthing\_official for more,1,40,5
broooo i have to wait 15 hours from mv release to album release     ,1,68,14
anyone know if ga1 is a vip ticket  ,1,36,8
starting to think were not getting a physical at this rate but still hopeful for more info later lets just have to wait,1,119,23
happy cake day steezvannoten  the only dare you ever want to take is the dare to be all that you can be ,1,104,22
 gt specifically how it looks like her right ear got cut off  lmao bro  her right ear is hidden because she has her head turned ,1,128,24
 and so the hype begins        my guess is that we ll see more possible colabs  upcoming us tv show appearances  i m hoping for the   the voice   and   snl     etc  etc  and then when they hit coachella  amp  dua lipa joins them on stage  just wishing  no inside info        gonna be a ride  god bless interscope,1,312,60
does anyone know if we re going to get a physical release ,1,58,11
no joke    they re 19 hours ahead of us   i guess i ll just stream the mv at work  ,1,83,18
i really can t imagine how big the whole comeback will be provided that so much hypes have been aroused these days,1,114,21
hit me more than they hit me with that ddu du ddu du,1,52,13
bp is killing this love with their killer legs  ,1,48,10
but do they have fast internet connection ,1,42,7
these music labels are huge  umg has literally hundreds of artists and groups vs k pop where there s maybe like  10 under a label at most  i guarantee you they have no idea who and who isn t with their label unless it s explicitly stated  there is no label allegiance as they literally cannot keep track  neither can i  i need to google who s with who   halsey is emi umg who just likes them dua lip is warner  who likes them and did a collab dj snake is interscope  but he just likes them we can t always assume it s a collab  ,1,528,98
i already liked woori bank  but now i love woori bank ,1,54,11
there is none yet  at this point i would assume that the physical album will drop at a later date and not this week  but that is purely speculative  don t take my word for it ,1,175,35
omg lisa s hair is goals,1,24,5
if i were the claw  i would choose jennie  ,1,43,10
honestly how can anyone hate this woman  ,1,41,7
4pm thursday for me  bring it on ,1,33,7
the red hair is really working for her  i m loving her visual this comeback  she needs to stop trying to bias wreck though  lisa and jennie do it enough as it is ,1,162,32
she s coming for us this comeback  i m ready to listen to her heavenly vocals while she kills me ,1,97,18
no not at all  just make a vlive account and that s all you need ,1,65,14
how are k blinks taking the news that the girls will have less than a week of promotions before the america tour  will they be doing full korean promos like music shows and radio programs for the few days they are still in korea  i don t want them to be exhausted when i see them week 1 coachella ,1,297,57
our girls making money moves over here  damn  ,1,46,9
unlucky hawaii blinks ,1,22,3
now this i m used to ,1,21,5
searching cheapest flight to kiribati   ,1,40,5
i couldn t catch any sleep lol,1,30,6
but isnt dj snake under interscope too though  just thinking,1,60,10
well okay   ,1,12,3
yeah that is exactly what i expected  was really the only way umg s request made any sense ,1,91,17
just take a snap  what are they going to do anyways  lol ,1,57,12
i m sorry in getting flashbacks of dj snake     we can t always assume if some western artist likes bp they want a collab,1,121,23
kiwi blinks  you ll be the first to hear the album ,1,51,10
international queens ,1,21,2
i used to live near la cienega  by melrose   the beverly center is a very popular shopping spot in west hollywood  this is almost the same as having a huge billboard in times square ,1,182,34
but i think they are interested in a collaboration,1,50,9
yeah but label allegiance isnt that important over here,1,55,9
damn i would be so excited if i saw that,1,40,10
3 more weeks until the us tour begins and about a week and a half until coachella  i honestly can t wait to see our girls on stage and to get the album via email  also  when are we getting album info  we ve gotten nothing ,1,222,44
i hope we ll get an m v teaser or album sampler  10 hours from now ,1,67,14
the acoustic version of whistle is one of my fave bp tracks  so i m ok with this ,1,81,17
in high school  i would stay up and watch the vlive and cry about getting new music lol this comeback i have college classes so i ll just leave the class and listen ,1,165,32
i feel like standing at b stage will be a better option  because even though they ll be a bit farther while on the main stage  at least they won t have their backs to you during any songs  ,1,189,37
removed because of incorrect date  pls repost  190402,1,53,8
ya i know since i was wondering taking a quick selfie but i was wondering if it s allowed since i know some places don t allow it and some places do and was wondering if you know if it s ok ,1,190,39
earlier is always better but i feel sad for the girls since they will stay up late for their vlive  they will have a pretty long weekend ,1,137,27
e l e c t r i c c h a i r,1,25,13
probably just gonna watch the countdown vlive  then the mv a ton  listening to the other songs  post a bunch on this sub because i think a lot of people will share their excitement and that s awesome  watch the mv a bunch more  i don t particularly care about the youtube records in itself  but i would be lying if i said i wouldn t follow it still  it s just such a good measurement of their growth  ,1,401,75
i agree  she looks      different  i didn t recognize her at first glance  i don t know what s off      but she looks a little different,1,136,27
do you have to pay to watch the vlive ,1,38,9
super excited for this  this countdown vlive was a highlight last year  iirc it didn t get uploaded to their channel after the fact  which it typically should but idk  just letting some of you know  p ,1,201,36
they hated jesus because he told them the truth ,1,48,9
i m kinda getting snsd genie vibes from the video  0,1,52,10
we boutta die i cant wait for the 4th,1,37,9
lisa s got mo  juice than hi c though,1,37,7
this looks so good ,1,19,4
hopefully not the english raps from jp version though,1,53,9
11pm kst,1,8,2
i sleep earlier and then wake up earlier  btw i live in michigan too   ,1,71,15
if these are new outfits then these are my favorite ones so far ,1,64,13
what a great time for blinks,1,28,6
is it korean time or which time zone ,1,37,8
the girls sometimes talks in korean mostly but they also do talks in english as they are quite aware the huge international fans that they have ,1,144,26
there s a translator on hand that does the subs live  the bp vlive channel doesn t keep countdown streams so if you miss it then it ll be hard to watch it again  i can t even find their square up countdowns on youtube except for small clips ,1,241,45
v live s like this usually have  live subs   someone translates while it s live  but the subs are a little bit delayed because it s live ,1,137,24
their vlive countdown is 10 am for me when i m at work  i would actually would have preferred to stay up late so i can stream in peace    ,1,138,29
i won t be able to watch the countdown  i m at work  correct me if i m wrong i remember the square up vlive countdown didn t have a replay ,1,139,27
wow  ros  looks amazing in this  the shaking camera and close ups has me creeped out and the teaser music is so eerie it complements the music video really well  this has me pretty excited for the mv that s going to drop on friday ,1,231,43
bigbang was mentioned in 2016 on the highest paid musicians list ,1,65,11
those are all resale tickets  they won t cancel a show that s been sold  ,1,73,13
 gt  there is no photoshop there absolutely is ,1,47,8
it s not  don t worry  it doesn t have subs when it s live  it usually takes a couple of hours to a few days before it gets subbed  ,1,132,26
does it have subs when it s live  i know this is a stupid question lol  ,1,72,15
dddd comeback i just stay up all night and watch the m v on loop and watch my twitter feed go crazy ,1,100,21
skip school  wake up to watch vlive and then whole day stream song,1,66,13
bts was on last year but yes they are the first gg ever to be on the list  kings of queens of kpop ,1,99,23
will it be in korean of english ,1,32,7
when the release used to be 6pm kst i would pull allnighters watching all their old mvs and catching their vlive   it was enough excitement to keep me up all night   this time around though i ll be in mid lecture when their mv drops,1,232,45
2am i gotta stay up loool,1,25,6
it will legit get released in time for me to listen to it on loop on the bus like fifty million times but other than that i think i am more excited before it gets released then there is like a week or two of hype after  and thats it  and i only watch it by myself  then send it to my other friends then we just talk about it later ,1,331,71
wow they are on forbes  is bp the first kpop group or girl group being mentioned by forbes ,1,91,18
yeah  especially jisoo and rosie s outfits  i can barely see jennie and lisa s outfits   are they really  i haven t heard that  ,1,128,21
but the whole deadly murderous vibe of the other outfits doesnt match with these  they also making another mv for  don t know what to do  right  ,1,145,26
i actually thought this picture was from their aiiyl era lol but i think it s another set of new outfit for ktl  ,1,113,22
woah is this another set of new outfit for the ktl song or this is an old picture ,1,82,18
i think this angle just makes her face look rounder than it is,1,62,13
wow they are having new outfits for different teasers  ,1,55,9
her right ear got chopped off  are you high do you know how perspective works ,1,78,15
thursday friday will be a long day for our girls  we all know how early inkygayo prep starts ,1,93,17
damn  that outfit is everything  ,1,33,5
im going to go later to work  they don t even care anyways  ,1,60,13
there is no photoshop  it s the style of makeup and lighting   ,1,63,11
this is like 4th outfit on this comeback huh,1,44,9
totally agree  it seems like the team were told to make a poster 10 mins before the post  and that s what we get  ,1,114,23
3 teasers  we re being well fed   ,1,34,7
oh don t get me wrong  her  actual  face is beautiful  the photoshop isn t   ,1,77,13
i love it     ,1,14,3
blackpink is under interscope records  universal music group   jason derulo is under atlantic records  warner music group   pretty interesting times  big 3 us music groups 1  umg  30     interscope  geffen  def jam  republix  capitol  island 2  sony  30     epic  rca  columbia 3  warner music  20     atlantic  parlophone    elektra,1,333,52
lisa  i m sorry for what they did to your face       amp  x200b   amp  x200b   amp  x200b ,1,90,14
goddamn that perfect profile and jawline in the thumbnail   ,1,60,9
other news  jason derulo and us label atlantic records are interested in blackpink  wow  there s bp us label umg  interscope records  and now warner music group  atlantic records  interested in the girls  2 of the big 3 us music groups ,1,236,40
i kinda found the crying performative and cringey   ,1,52,8
again  i don t know if there will be any changes in na since they will have 4 new songs by then   but i think  most of their songs are performed in main stage  is wrong description   i feel like stage b has more  or at least 50 50 ,1,231,46
it s either a sub unit  which probably will be the baddest subunit of all time  with a collab with pharrell or lisa just accompanied jennie that time  ,1,151,27
that s what i was thinking  like if they perform in stage b  they ll be a lot closer to me  but base on what i heard  main stage is ideal because most of their songs are performed in the main stage ,1,198,40
highly recommend stage b  i don t know how it would be in la  there may have some different between asia leg and na leg   but in my experience  if your position is good enough  when the girls went to stage b  you will feel like they just stand in front of you  [this pic from their taipei concert]   might help you understand what i m talking about   ros  sometimes even went to the edge of stage  where the lights equipments are  ,1,431,81
we   stan  ,1,11,4
i put a cheeky half day holiday request in at work for thursday and it got accepted yesterday  ,1,95,18
can we have one dedicated day for shitposting memes  it makes the sub more enjoyable,1,84,14
this is creeping me out  but i cant stop scrolling up to peak lol,1,65,14
shooketh shooketh shooketh  park chaeyoung let me talk to you,1,61,10
i think they made it 0 pm simply because it will be morning in the west coast of usa  if it was like 6 pm korean time this would mean it the release will be around 11 pm   4am for americans and not many people will be up at that time  you can check out one post above for the exact time that the comeback will released in your place  ,1,334,71
back when their mv s were released at 6pm kst  which is 2am where i m at   i take a power nap in order to wake up at 1 55am to watch the mv as it premieres ,1,156,34
kim jisoo let me talk to you ,1,29,7
they won t    or maybe they will lol  \\\_   \_   ,1,50,9
did it come with the merch included in the vip package or no ,1,61,13
got the tix in the mail few days after it went on sale   \\\_   \_   ,1,69,14
i mean my ticket is blink vip  i m just not sure which part of the stage i should be in  the big main stage or the center b stage  ,1,131,29
they won t stop walking just so you could get a selfie with em      \\\_   \_   ,1,80,15
so it s going to be released on thursday in america  i thought that friday releases were the best for billboard  now i m confused at umg s request  wouldn t this be a disadvantage to blackpink ,1,193,33
it depends on what your ticket is  get close to the stage if possible lol ,1,74,15

hyun sak    ,1,12,2
 gt also did anyone notice the blackpink turned from blood red to pink  yeah  noticed it in the first teaser  really nice transition  ,1,134,22
the layout is back and a temporary teaser banner is up  no more yang hyun suk   automoderator is also back to work  removing your posts if you don t follow the [title guidelines ]     [weekly discussion thread]   [in your area world tour masterthread]  ,1,253,42
actually i would love to have a live band version,1,49,10
do you think it may be their contract  ,1,39,8
jisooo    ,1,10,2
ros  was my bias square up era but jisoo is becoming my bias this era and i m not complaining ,1,94,19
seriously though  ,1,18,3
that angle of her in the beginning is just   ,1,45,10
i really like it  but i expected some other teaser now and then the two videos later  i hope we ll get the ros  one later and not tomorrow at least  d oh well  jisoo is looking stunning and mysterious here  but that honestly goes without saying,1,244,46
ok guys and girls  i m officially dead and the song comes out on thursday  you are all invited to my funeral tomorrow ,1,118,22
woohoo omg so excited for the comeback,1,38,7
she looks so good ,1,18,4
no more jichuu this comeback  this is kim jisoo y all  goddamn  ,1,64,11
most of us i believe ,1,21,5
ah    that caf  video of theirs  what a classic  ,1,49,9
anyone know exactly how soundcheck works  i heard that you need the original ticket buyer s id to get in  but if i bought a resold ticket online how would it work  also do different ga seats mean anything  i saw different ga seats on stubhub vividtickets etc and was just wondering since its all standing  do different tiers have different entry times   thanks   ,1,363,61
24 hour sales and view numbers will be available 11 am edt on friday so it would be news before the weekend  [they held the youtube korean record until bts idol ]   they would need 30  more views than dddd to reclaim that and about 50  more to pass ag for  1 music video  that would be huge friday lunchtime headlines if either were to happen  domestically  it gives them an additional 18 hours of view counts before music shows and they count towards points for wins ,1,468,86
same for me  but it releases when i m in class d ,1,49,11
yeah this is really all that matters  they know what they are doing and for fans it doesn t matter too much either way ,1,119,23
it seems weird to me even when she says she confirmed it  it might be miscommunication  like yes the album will come out at midnight in korea  if i had to guess it would be released under  global release day  which is friday at midnight  oh well we will see  i don t think it matters too much either way tbh  i just don t see why umg would request it otherwise ,1,361,70
i wouldn t worry too much about all of the technicalities involved  if umg specifically requested this  there must be a good reason for it  i m sure they ve already taken all of this into consideration  look at all of the hit artists umg interscope has produced  i trust their judgment on this  at the end of the day they re going to do what s best for business  i m sure this was a well thought out decision  not just lucian grange texting yg at the last minute like   yo can you like make the release time midnight bc western market k thx     ,1,545,99
[tweet]   looks like that s not the case  it s midnight kst  ,1,61,10
i find it weird that it is a midnight release kst  honestly as an international fan  i didn t mind waking up at 3am my time for release  it s part of the fun  so i don t really understand why umg would want this  and i don t think it s a midnight release within each time zone  that would be a mess  ,1,300,59
i think the album itself will be released at midnight in each timezone  that would make the most sense regarding umg,1,116,21
i heard that yg added the d4 remix in there to make it a 5 track album  making it eligible for album awards and music shows  but then i also heard the minimum number of songs for awards eligibility is 6 and remix is not counted  i am so confused  can any of you confirm which one is the truth with source  if the latter is the truth  it d be really depressing that yg wouldn t add 1 or 2 more songs to their album for the awards  ,1,430,86
i just hope for an actual mp3 release for it  or better yet  one recorded in the studio ,1,88,18
i heard that yg added the d4 remix in there to make it a 5 track album  making it eligible for album awards and music shows  but then i also heard the minimum number of songs for awards eligibility is 6 and remix is not counted  i am so confused  do any of you know which one is the truth  if the latter is the truth  it d be really depressing that yg wouldn t add 1 or 2 more songs to their album for the awards  ,1,414,84
the faces that greet you after you close that incognito window ,1,63,11
the 0am is gonna affect their vlive countdown  or will they still have one   ,1,77,15
messaged you ,1,13,2
that s technically what they sing in concert for really ,1,56,9
but this would make more people fall in love and they are trying to kill this love ,1,83,17
woot  8am thurs 4 4,1,19,4
v live s twitter deleted that tweet about blackpink  so i really don t know what s going on  like they canceled it or what ,1,123,22
can this just be the new album cover  lol,1,41,9
i honestly think they went too ham with the lighting and saturation  ,1,69,12
i am still hoping that they will have their own songs  of course teddy s music is very good but i believe the girls do have the talent,1,134,27
just as a warning to any 1st time come back blinks  there are occasionally spoilers during the vlive so be careful if you want to stay completely in the dark about the songs  if you don t mind though definitely try to watch  it is a lot of fun ,1,244,48
i need that reggae version ,1,27,5
i m liking this blackred      ,1,30,7
4 and a remix\ ,1,15,4
i m so happy because the mv will be released on april 4th 6pm for me   the only sad thing is i won t be home until later because i will have math classes   idk how i ll study with all that hype and excitement   april 4th can t come sooner,1,238,47
not gonna lie  i think of dddd everytime i hear that shark song ,1,64,13
just watched it earlier and immediately thought of this    ,1,59,10
6 in the afternoon in greece,1,28,6
i think everybody would ,1,24,4
anyone think the chicago show may be canceled  stubhub is full of people reselling  as well as facebook and obviously here too  this is what ticketmaster looks like  [    idk if yg would do that  but ik wanna one cancelled last year bc they couldn t fill the arena  ,1,266,49
i would actually love to see an album with rose playing the acoustic guitar and sing with her lovely voice ,1,107,20
me too ,1,7,2
it s possible that they reached out to him  but knowing yg it s probably another forever young case ,1,100,17
yes  the comeback is on 4th of april for us europeans and also americans and africans  as for the time  it comes at 6 pm for me and i am from bulgaria  if you are in central europe it will be 5 pm and if you are in the western part  uk  spain  portugal  etc    4pm  ,1,266,57
op name is arianator what do u expect ,1,38,8
it s a joke  they comeback with five new music,1,46,9
i shared this on the bp meme subreddit like a month or two ago  my niece is going to be one soon and she loves it   ,1,116,27
not gonna lie i would have liked an acoustic version of really  love that song  ,1,80,15
damn  i think i d get jisoo s cute signature though,1,51,9
it is though  ,1,14,3
sadly  that s not an april fool s joke,1,38,7
for more check out  asianthing\_official,1,40,5
yeah but apparently umg wanted them to change it so it was more accessible in the us  comes out at 11am for me ,1,111,23
my bias is lisa  she s not just a great dancer and rapper  but she has a great personality who knows how to make her bp members laugh  she is also very caring and humble  however  after watching a lot of bp s diaries on youtube  i think i m biased to jennie  jisoo  and rose as well ,1,283,55
 bangs fist on table  un  ban  memes ,1,37,7
don t they usually release at 6pm korean time ,1,46,8
the teaser photos  group teaser photo and video teaser all give me different vibes   ,1,85,14
jisoo just made my monday feel better  ,1,39,7
if i ever get the money please believe i will,1,45,10
thank you  this is perfect  i ve used this site before  but never knew it had this function  ,1,93,17
remember not to call her cat fat  p,1,35,8
what an absolute treasure  ,1,27,5
quick question  i just noticed that the album is going to be released at 0am  does that mean i ll be able to listen to it on april 4th or 5th  5pm i guess  since i live in europe  also hope not was written by masta wu  didn t he leave yg like 3 years ago  is this another forever young case ,1,291,60
april 4  11 am est,1,18,5
got stunned ,1,12,2
they really did her dirty with how they edited the wig in that photo  either this is a different wig or they really photoshopped out the roots and changed the tone and how frizzy it looked ,1,189,36
i definitely think that there will be a physical album  iirc there were already news about 2 versions and them shooting pics for the album no  but it is indeed very weird that there are no preorders or design out yet  i am hoping that will be today s teaser ,1,258,49
when track list first came i was 99  recharged  1 down because of the 5th track  let s kill this comeback since other top tier group will be competing with us  good luck to my fellow blackpink fans too,1,201,38
thanks for posting this  i ll definitely enter  ,1,48,7
lisa is my ult bias  she s quirky  a great dancer  language queen  seems really good hearted  and i loooooove her voice  not at all the typical idol voice  ,1,156,27
yes  following them is something my wife and i share together and it s helped us grow closer  ,1,94,17
it s from youtube  so you can download it as a mp3,1,50,11
i love your flair   my heart so bounceu   maybe the most adorable words ever spoken ,1,84,15
i m actually really salty yge hasn t giving us a album design reveal or pre order notice and the comeback is this friday    i ve seen some speculate that we re not getting a physical album but i m still hopeful ,1,211,36
pink wig jisoo gives me life,1,28,6
i m giving a ga ticket  w o sc  for free  if any fellow blink is interested ,1,76,15

hopefully everyone here is familiar with areia remix  if not  here you go  full disclosure  i am a supporter of his on patreon  he made 3 remixes for ddd       my favorite   ,1,174,31
i always thought it was weird to get someone else s name face tattooed on yourself  exception being you actually know that person irl and they re close to you ,1,159,27
i ve thought about getting the cube from the square up cover ,1,61,11
yea sorry man was gonna crosspost this but its not allowed on here ,1,67,13
who ever made this def  has too much time ,1,42,9
they hated her for saying the truth,1,35,7
yes   i can t wait for new bops   ,1,34,7
wow  that scared me ,1,20,4
she s the cutest,1,16,3
there are dozens of us   dozens   ,1,34,6
nice to see a fellow coloradan blink lol,1,40,8
and here i thought april fools pranks weren t funny  well done  op,1,66,12
those outfits are amazing     ,1,30,4
i really love all of them  i can t decide   jisoo  i love her well rounded personality  and she never fails to make me laugh whenever i watch her on variety shows or vlive  lisa  i love how bubbly she can be but i love how she also has a shy side  it s so cute  her dancing skills are incredible to watch  i love watching her perform  jennie  i first discovered jennie trainee promo video where she sings and raps like years before they debut and i thought  wow this girl is talented and pretty too i m def going to stan her whenever she debuts   rose  i love her voice  i fell in love with her voice after watching her on masked singer then i went to look up blackpink songs as well after that ,1,695,135
we re using the yymmdd format on this sub  and it was april 1 in korea when they posted this  so  it should ve been 190104    gt   3 use of submission titles    gt   gt yymmdd title  gt   gt all content must follow the title [guidelines]    gt   gt example  february 12  2019     190212     gt   gt ensure you are using the correct date  for example  official blackpink content should use kst   amp  x200b ,1,406,64
i m getting such a femme fatale vibe from these teasers and i love it  i absolutely cannot wait for this comeback    ,1,117,22
hm i didn t get a grime or garage vibe from this video  it is pretty short though  that  said   korean grime doesn t exist  i like it a lot  [damndef]   has done a lot of it  [rhythm power   bangsaneung]   [3racha   p a c e ]   [young b  hash swan  killagramz  hangzoo   yozm gang]   [damndef  ryno  mckdaddy  moldy  jindotgae  korkash   chop]   ,1,346,59

saw this on ,1,12,3
with the live band   ,1,21,4
i m okay with this ,1,19,4
hey admin  how about a meme day in every week ,1,46,10
i think there will be more english this time   they ll talk more english  since the release time has changed from 6pm kst to 12am kst just to attract more international fans,1,173,31
lmfaaoo it s not  it s actually a pretty cool tattoo   ,1,55,10
i can t tell if  s,1,18,5
woah they look so good,1,22,5
i love how everyone downvoted me  y all truly are pathetic  ,1,60,11
wow this is a  great  idea   i might have to get one myself   ,1,62,13
and other artists put out one album in 3 years with like 12 songs  now you have a fair point to say that kpop in general has a different strategy  with way more content  but you cannot just say that everyone has to follow that style either  in my experience the more songs you put out in a specific timeframe  the more likely it is that people won t care about most of these songs  releasing a lot will lead to people having different favorites though  but in general i think most people will listen to the full album a few times and then pick their favorites and never listen to the  filler  ever again  how many of these 27 songs do you really cherish  now i am not gonna sit here and pretend that everything yg has done so far in the contex of musical content is fine  2017 was a disgrace with only having one song  but people shouldn t focus on the past so much  last year we got 4 original blackpink songs  1 collaboration and 1 solo  for this year the plan is to get another ep out later and possibly all 3 other solos  that would make it 4   3   4  worst case for the 2nd ep  songs  and i wouldn t be surprised to get another collaboration as well  now one can be careful and say that the other stuff is only planned so far  totally agree  but looking at the financial report of yge it seems fair to hope for the 2nd ep  it seem to be their strategy going forward  point is  things are only getting better  it seems so weird to complain about it when it is the best time to be a blackpink fan yet ,1,1504,294
didn t they do the same for forever young  i m expecting a dance practice  but not an mv ,1,89,17
yes lisa kill it ,1,17,4
 gt  does this seriously make you any less of a fan  because i don t see how and why it would  if you take a step back and look at what they ve accomplished  there s a method to the madness indeed  and it s working people really don t like to hear this but it is simply the truth  blackpink is basically the biggest korean girlgroup right now  arguably the 2nd biggest kpop group period  totally agree with you  it seems to be working  2017 was the real problem for their overall song catalog  that was the year we only got one song  now people expect them to make up for it i guess  but it seems like yg actually wants them to have 2 cbs per year from now on if one looks at the financial report which was released recently  that would make it 4 songs in 2016  1 song in 2017  4 songs in 2018  5 with the solo  6 with the collab  and so far 4 in 2019  with potential 3 solos and another ep   so it is only getting better and better  i would wish people to see that  ,1,967,190
looks like it was re uploaded  only the first part of the tweet is still there  maybe they had to remove because yg wanted to wait and announce it  ,1,148,29
also got a  beulping  [tatoo]    ,1,33,6
so the link still works [when i open it in reddit app]     but when i use pc to open it  it just read the page doesn t exist      i don t know what s wrong  hope they don t cancel it    ,1,186,38
is this music from the song  sounds pretty tense  3 more days guys    lets go,1,77,15
 i know you pain  this 00 00 thing bothers me sometimes ,1,56,10
we prefer the term koreaboo  thank you,1,38,7
ahh the link doesn t work for me at all  now i have to wait a whole extra day  that s my fault  they should have said it was being released 4th at 23 59  midnight throws it off for me  ,1,185,38
good try  try harder ,1,21,4
the tweet is still there   it wrote  4 4 11 00 pm   lt   korea time so it will probably be 4th 7am   10am depends on where you are ,1,131,26
 i would like to ask why there are no hangul characters for kill this love  don t know what to do  and kick it  in this poster  ,1,128,26
the tweet is gone  did it say the 4th cause i guess i was under the impression them releasing on the 4th at 0am meant the 3rd for us  not 4th 0am   5th  if that makes sense  ,1,174,38
jennie    to me is the most beautiful girl in the world,1,55,11
44 here  ,1,9,3
44 here,1,7,2
 gt  mv teaser at thursday y all but  the song is coming out thursday for most westerners  ,1,91,16
when it s ready,1,15,3
true that  for all we know this could be a super cute song  dalla dalla is a good example  everyone thought it was going to be a trap banger  turned out to be a bop instead  hopefully kill this love is a banger,1,210,43
can t wait for this   ,1,22,5
i mean    it has more of a melody than the original version  ,1,61,12
you weebs are pathetic  ,1,24,5
11pm sgt  since it s released at midnight in korea   ,1,53,10
if i didn t know any better i really would ve thought she dyed her hair  it looks great on her and hope it s featured prominently in the mv  interesting teaser too  continues the eeries vibes that lisa s gave off ,1,213,38
is there a download link somewhere   amp  x200b ,1,48,7
i haven t decided yet  it s really hard  ,1,41,8
i ll be awake at 12am sgt,1,25,6
omg wasn t expecting anything else today  thought they d drop one daily  hope we can expect jisoo and ros  later ,1,113,19
oh wow they goin all out now yes yes ,1,37,9
omggggggggggg  she looks so gooooooooooooooooooooooood  damn  i need this comeback pronto  ,1,91,11
when it s gonna release  ,1,25,4
full release when ,1,18,3
but    what was jisoo doing this whole time  ,1,45,8
look on the bright side  you can watch replay later with full subtitles ,1,72,13
thwy already released jennie s teaser,1,37,5
thank you   my body  my mind and my wallet are all ready for this comeback   ,1,77,16
very well  very well,1,20,4
first songlist then lisa teaser and now this       vnvnvnc i can t breathe,1,74,12
in the photo they released it really washed her out but in the video it looks very good on her  ,1,96,20
haha omg,1,8,2
that wig looks convincing ,1,26,4
there s someone on the vlive staff that live translates what they re saying  although its kind broken english but enough to understand ,1,135,21
fuck what you heard  jennie looks so dope in blonde  holy shit  ,1,64,12
i knew it  there s no way they ll drop every teasers each dayyy we ll expect the mv teaser at thursday y all get readyy ,1,120,22
this hurts more than a gunshot would dammit,1,43,8
even though i know it s a wig  blonde jennie still hits me like a truck every time i see her  ,1,94,20
but actually it s legit  because there s not much time left now  1 4  lisa and jennie s teaser 2 4  jisoo s teaser 3 4  rosie s teaser 4 4  mv teaser 5 4  comeback,1,163,27
that thumbnail is fire,1,22,4
at this point everything is just gonna drop at once  you so weird yg ,1,69,14
i m working when they do it  ,1,29,7
or maybe they remixed d4 into a ballad one lololol,1,50,10
nah it s kick it for sure lol,1,29,7
yes  exactly  as you may know  there is literally a cpc working force monitoring all sorts of cultural activities in china       amp  x200b  but still some mainland chinese directors were able to direct some high quality movies with some foreign productions  like jia zhangke s works  recently  mountains may depart  and  ash is purest white   and  earlier  zhang yi mou s movies  ,1,381,58
i recommend  mad world    trivisa    ten years    men on the dragon    tracey  and  project gutenberg   though there are many colloquial elements in these movies  they are generally quite good  in fact  many good productions had released in the past few years ,1,260,41
lisoo s telling us to buckle up im so hyped lmaoo,1,49,10
haha very true lol,1,18,4
i love how eerie it sounds  very disturbing  but i like it  lol,1,63,13
same   i have a 7 30 am lecture  and a quiz for that lecture too   sucks ,1,73,15
my babies  the comeback is getting closer and closer  umg making yge change their plans  i stan  they deserve the world  and they will have it   queens,1,151,27
i wouldn t be surprised to see them speaking even more english this time around since they re marketing more globally now  and as somebody who doesn t understand korean  i m thankful lol  also just as a fellow aussie who loves hearing rosie speak  i m excited   ,1,262,43
lisa would love this ,1,21,4
blackpink going for that grime garage genre ,1,44,6
idk man  its thermodynamics ,1,28,4
creepy  eerie and unsettling  i like it  definitely seeing lisa in my nightmares and looking forward to it  i did not kill this love  i did not  oh hi  lisa  ,1,158,30
this is more important  skip the lecture   ,1,43,8
thanks   can t wait to see them ,1,32,7
if i remembered correctly from the dddd countdown there were english subtitles but not for every single sentence  good enough to understand what they re saying though  jennie and rose also occasionally spoke english to cater to international fans as well  sooooooooo hyped for this comeback   ,1,293,46
even if she does i probably die the moment she said yes ,1,56,12
just the exactly time the new songs comes out   but you can watch replay later  ,1,80,15
teasers are always misleading,1,29,4
well  i think it s safe to say  none  of us were expecting this sound   o,1,73,15
idk why you re being downvoted  its a simple question ,1,54,9
jisoo yeah  her 4d personality is so adorable  she s the oldest and prettiest in the group and yet she acts the most immature  ,1,127,23
can t wait ,1,11,2
actually it s my first too  but i ve watched almost every video on their free v live channel ,1,93,17
dude this is tragic  i have an 8am lecture on the 4th ,1,54,12
is there any eng sub during the live  i ve watched replays of previous countdown live  and they were already got subtitles  hope this time they will use more english ,1,166,29
i understand  but for us its 2200 hehe,1,38,8
lisa   every time i watch  as if it s your last  and she shows up with that candy floss  my day becomes infinitely better ,1,122,24
thanks  this is my first comeback  i m excited and have so many questions lol ,1,78,14
you can watch it directly  ,1,27,6
do you know if we have to be subbed to watch the stream  ,1,57,13
yes    it took me a long long time to calculate it    ,1,54,11
[ominous wooshing],1,18,2
honestly  i love it ,1,20,4
so april 4th 7am  pst  for us audiences  lol ,1,45,9
lalisa manoban let me talk to you  ,1,35,7
last countdown vlive for square up had almost 1 million viewers  can t imagine what it will be this time around ,1,112,20
you saved my ass  sorry for the typo ,1,37,8
directed by david lynch,1,23,4
so that s april 3rd at 7am  pst  for the us audience right  i m not great with time changes  ,1,93,18
considering local time  i thought they might cancel it ,1,55,9
that s a comeback routine for them i think ,1,43,8
jisoo is and will forever be my ultimate bias  she s perfect  her voice is fantastic  she s beautiful and she care for us blinks  plus she s jisoo and she s ok  ros  is my second favorite for similar reasons  jennie and lisa are also fantastic but i can choose between them,1,273,49
i   amp  x200b   amp  x200b  did they intend for it to be this eerie ,1,69,12
blackpink x meshuggah when ,1,27,4
this is too good,1,16,4
idk why but it feels like a horror movie,1,40,9
i m scared  but very excited,1,28,5

can i say that i do not have a favourite member  as i love all four members equally ,1,84,18
we might get a new member video teaser every couple of hours ,1,61,12
gotta beat bots for that karma  ,1,32,7
i m confused  am i dead  ,1,25,5
it s 9 am thursday colorado time  mst  this is the best news ,1,61,12
fkdnsnsnskksksks idk why this comment reminded me of stranger things omfggg,1,75,11
this is so creepy  i love it ,1,29,7
who doesnt haha ,1,16,3
ohhh myyy godddd  love this murder vibe so much      i m so fucking excited  but usually how close to the actual song are the samples in these teasers ,1,151,28
i was confused when lisa was upside down i thought they were legs,1,65,13
ahs  blackpink this took me there  wow ,1,39,7
i m getting a creepy dark vibe  i like it ,1,42,8
lisa giving me american horror story vibes and i am not complaining  ,1,69,12
wow creepy but attractive ,1,26,4
the video teasers are always the killers for me  i go into comebacks as clean as i possibly can  i want to click but must resist ,1,129,26
i m trying to fall asleep for work tomorrow and this came out  it kinda spooked me a little but in a good way  so ready ,1,120,25
this is out of nowhere wtf this is not good and my bias too wth,1,63,15
oh my god,1,9,3
ment to put 033119 omg sorry i panicked ,1,40,8
what wtf,1,8,2
it s really eerie  i m super into it  ,1,38,7
hey  hey  take it easy  you re starting to cut deep ,1,52,10
that would be like 9pm est ,1,27,6
if nini doesn t have those bangs in the kill this love mv i m gonna riot    ,1,76,16
tbh it s pretty catchy lmao,1,27,5
lisa is my favourite member because she is so sweet  is a language kween and has a dance ability that one day i wish to achieve ,1,128,26
crap memes be like   ,1,21,4
why is iz one in this though,1,28,6
whoever made that yhs banner is evil     im crying lol ,1,55,12
reported for harassment  i don t need this kind of negativity in my life  thanks  i hate it ,1,92,17
i thought there would be more millennium production on this  maybe teddy prefers r tee to pass the torch to and is pushing blacklabel ,1,134,23
phenomenal  applause ,1,21,2
blonde ros  is my fav  i love that look on her,1,46,11
lol 4 new songs   ,1,18,4
both tracks share the spotlight in terms of promotion  so we ll likely have choreography for the subtitle track and it will get played along side ktl at events ,1,160,28
dddd remix will be  2 behind ktl on the korean charts just watch    ,1,68,14
can someone explain to me why the first two songs are labeled  title  and  subtitle  ,1,85,15
modern art ,1,11,2
yeah  even though i ve heard remixes of dddd  it s intriguing to think what they are going to do with it  ,1,106,20
very witty  ,1,12,3
i love them all equally  but if push comes to shove ill pick jisoo because shes the reason why i discovered blackpink,1,117,22
jisoo is goddess ,1,17,3
this    this hit me more than ros  s high note in whistle,1,57,10
ros  is my bias    her voice  she s so passionate when she sings  nothing better than playing her cover of eyes closed while driving home at 2 a m      similar to how rosie speaks korean with an accent  i speak my own mother tongue with an english accent  she seems so much more relatable knowing that we share that similarity    her aussie accent     the first thing that drew me in was that she was from abroad  still can t get over her accent to this day lol    western musical influences   despite being a kpop idol  it seems like her musical tastes are still pretty western   indie  again  so relatable   her indie ass must be so excited for coachella lol    her constant pursuit for self improvement  based on the books she reads and comments from other members  she never seem satisfied staying status quo whether it be staying back late to practice or reading self help books    from her vlives to instagram posts  rosie just seems like a genuinely kind person  i m sure i have more but i figured five reasons would be enough   ,1,1036,191
jisoo  she has a great personality and i think she is the  glue  member of the group ,1,85,17
lmao i relate to this so hard ,1,30,7
remember this is a yg artist we are talking about  expect less  appreciate more ,1,80,14
it s true   ,1,12,3
im calling in the morning  thanks for the info   ,1,49,10
i m a film buff so i watch a lot of foreign movies around the world  korean cinema is always impressing me with their creativity and quality output  hong kong cinema made some great movies  ie in the mood for love  2046  infernal affairs  back in the day but i sort of stopped paying attention to chinese movies since mainland china took over  the problem with the chinese film industry is they rely too much on star power to prop up their films to the detriment of quality writing or anything else really  it used to be a majority of the production budget would go to the movie stars that the government had to step in and cap the percentage they can get  china considers the film industry one of it s pillars so there s a lot of subsidization and big money be thrown at it  film companies are spending more than then they can make at the box office and the bubble will burst if they don t slow down and make good movies  it doesn t help that there s also censorship laws and that limits what kind of films can be made that can appeal to a global audience ,1,1057,197
that makes sense  ,1,18,3
masta wu left  he did lyrics for rose by lee hi i think as well,1,63,15
why were people expecting this ep to have at least 5 songs  when square up only had 4  i think most people were expecting 4 songs ,1,130,26
so not a cover of the epik high song of the same name then ,1,59,14
or if you post 92392819378 memes ,1,33,6
i think d4 remix could be an english version for coachella,1,58,11
no worries  i ll see what i can come up tonight ,1,48,10
not hating  i m just saying make a great one and post it  those are really basic level but ok  good luck with your classes ,1,123,24
haha  it s 7pm where i m at so i m just getting them in before the deadline  also  i m starting classes tomorrow  so this is my only free time ,1,143,27
it s about time bp has more than 1 videos  they haven t done that since 2016 iirc  ,1,83,16
i feel like hope not is the ballad one,1,38,9
chill bruh  this is the third one in an hour  focus on quality instead of quantity  ,1,84,16
lisa since day 1 but love em all ,1,33,8
i don t think any blink is stoked about the release cadence of their songs  what bothers me is people acting like they are surprised when they get exactly what was promised  like somehow they were magically going to get an lp  no one should have been surprised by this ,1,269,49
quality over quantity,1,21,3
hope the remix is a rock remix,1,30,7
well it wouldnt stop them from working with masta wu even if he had left  ,1,74,15
people were expecting at least 5 new songs not 4 songs and a remix that no one wants or needs  i don t understand why people act like the small amount of songs they have is acceptable  y all jump at anyone who gets upset when they have every right to be  3 years 13 songs  that s embarrassing and unacceptable and if people are upset they can be  it s not being ungrateful if it s been 3 years  ,1,395,74
as requested by umg ,1,20,4
oooh maybe  especially since they titled it as a sub title ,1,59,10
i hope its a banger too  hopefullt 2 videos  ,1,45,9
at this point i believe no  i lost all faith  ,1,46,10
4 new bangers and i couldn t be happier   subtitle  title track  could this supposed spy concept be a 2 parter  am i getting my hopes up too high for 2 mv releases this comeback  i hope jennie wears as many wigs as the number of songs they have  i m beyond excited to see the album packaging details  ,1,301,57
i m an 80 s baby  in the us  and fairly new to kpop blackpink  as a result  i m not well versed on how other kpop artists groups release their music  all i know is a couple of things  1  how western artists operate  and we might get an album every other year  i don t mind 4 5 6 songs every 9 months or whatever it is here  it really is quality over quantity in this case  the proof is in the catalog  we re getting mega hits every drop  no filler  well maybe this time with a dddd remix  but i guess we ll have to hear it to find out  2  does this seriously make you any less of a fan  because i don t see how and why it would  if you take a step back and look at what they ve accomplished  there s a method to the madness indeed  and it s working  ,1,750,146
let s hope all songs get a mini movie style m v,1,47,10
my bias is jisoo for many reasons    she is a good unni for the other girls   she seems very smart and comfortable as the leader for the group   she is a gamer and doesn t let anyone give her trouble about it   she is really funny and playful with the other members   her english is adorable   her singing is top notch   oh  and she is ridiculously beautiful she also has a natural ability for harmonizing  the girls talk about this but blackpink songs don t tend to have too many harmonies  but when i finally saw their sure thing cover i realized what they were talking about  she sings beautiful harmonies throughout the entire song ,1,636,120
i m calling it right now  kick it  is gonna be the best song,1,60,13
we ll probably see a choreography for the sub title track too  would be stupid to hire 4 world class choreographers just for the title track ,1,141,24
i feel pretty confident that you will be able to see the stage well and will not have your view blocked if that is what you are worried about  in addition  there will be enormous screens up that you will definitely be able to see no matter where you sit  honestly  no matter how close i am at a concert  i often end up watching the video boards since you can see the artists so much better there anyway  and the energy of the live music is the same no matter where you re looking  i have a feeling that you would have to buy two tickets  but i would strongly suggest that you go for it  being around 16 000  other people who love our girls as much as we do  or are just bp curious  should be amazing ,1,700,137
looks like i m in business   ,1,29,6
my fav is lisa because she s 1  the prettiest and cutest thing to exist ever 2  a distinctive happy and bubbly personality that shows through anytime the girls are on camera 3  genuinely a kind and sweet person 4  displayed little personality quirks and reactions that i personally resonate with 5  a hella good dancer  like top 5 in all of kpop  top 3 maybe even   6  longdari lisa not gonna lie  ros  has been siphoning a lot of my lisa bias these days  if lisa makes the bias cutoff at a 10  rose is a 9 85  give me a month and my bias might actually change  ,1,562,108
like i said before  it was announced as a mini album awhile ago  you are acting like you are surprised  no one was expecting this to be an lp ,1,142,29
it s not like you re barred from producing tracks for someone if you re not a part of the agency  masta wu is close with yg and it s artists and producers  he s probably someone teddy trusts  so i see why teddy wouldn t hit him up  ,1,232,43
this should be permanentttttt  gt   ,1,36,5
they re going for constant releases through the year over full albums that require alot of investment and half the tracks get neglected  there s still another mini album and 3 solos to look forward to ,1,201,34
same feelings here  but i believe this proves something too  the joke reflects certain expectations towards a particular company sigh,1,133,20
was hoping there wouldn t be any acoustic remix songs so  can finally drop that lame joke  sigh ,1,96,16
first release of theirs to not feature pink    ddu du remix sounds dope af  still wish the aiiyl remix would get a release   ,1,125,23
as long as the songs are fire like square up 4 new songs is fine  it s all about quality ,1,89,19
i was expecting more than four new tracks and a remix no one asked for  the vast majority of other k pop artists manage this  why can t they ,1,141,27
mine has always been lisa  i got into blackpink right after their debut  and she just stuck out to me right away  been my bias ever since  she s talented  cool  has the ability to switch personas on and off stage  kind  pretty  that being said  i could also use all of those adjectives to describe the other members too lol  ,1,325,60
she s changed her hair every time  i don t think she s gonna stop any time soon lol,1,83,16
wooo lydia paek     love her work,1,33,7
i ve never been so ready and also so unready at the same time before    ,1,72,14
i don t have any bp memes    i only have one bts one lmao ,1,58,13
ok  i m game  kanye west  my all time favorite artist  put out 27 songs between 2016 and 2018  this isn t counting collaborative albums like ksg  blackpink can t even manage half  and why do you immediately jump to the  how about western artists     defense  because you re aware of how embarrassing bp s release schedule is within the scope of their own industry ,1,364,59
but hope not should be an old track like forever young  as masta wu left yg in 2016  i think they still have many songs left out in the dungeon,1,143,30
hey y all  does anyone know what time the soundcheck is    i got vip so idk when to get there,1,93,19
hope not should be an old track like forever young  as masta wu left yg in 2016,1,79,17
i don t know the legality around remixes but it s probably something they can perform on stage but since they can t sell it on any cd s i don t know if it counts or not tbh,1,172,34
i love april 1,1,14,4
nobody knows for sure at this point  but i think there were news about there being 2 versions  so probably  preorders tomorrow if i had to guess ,1,145,27
yes  finally  i can t wait for the ep release  i m a bit neutral over the dddd remix  but interested in how they ll remix it  i m honestly fine with 4  5 would have been ideal  but 4 will do  i m almost certain that   hope not   will be a ballad  lydia paek was a main producer for lee hi s debut album and has worked on other projects  mainly rnb influenced  seo won jin worked on the production of blackpink s  stay  along with teddy  finally masta wu is mainly a lyricist and has worked on lee hi and hi suhyun s   i m different  and other songs that i can t recall  ,1,570,106
this is a smart move  it s time to go global for real,1,53,12
they are       ,1,15,3
ok  so the one thing that stands out to me most is 04  hope not   my favorite 2ne1 song is  ugly   cowriten by lydia paek  she also wrote bp s aiiyl and half of le hi s first album ,1,181,37
i was hoping we d see less teddy but i m pumped regardless  i love the styling concept of the teasers so far ,1,109,20
in the summer  june july likely  probably before their australian tour  for ros   not sure about the other two yet  as for the next ep  all we know is it will be the upcoming fall ,1,180,34
18hrs earlier from the regular release ill take it ,1,51,9
y e s,1,5,3
what were you expecting  they announced it was going to be a mini album months ago  they are going to have another comeback in the fall  also an ep  along with the other member s solos  starting with chaeng  i kind of prefer this  it just means we get new bp all year ,1,268,52
you can be critical for sure  but at least phrase it in a reasonable way  ,1,74,15
oh yeah  when s that coming out ,1,32,6
why do i have to always love yg groups   it hurts so much because any other management would give a group this successful a full album and solos for all the members already  i am excited for this ep  i just want blackpink to be as successful as possible because they are amazing ,1,279,53
jisoo hands down  ros  is a close 2nd  but i love them all equally ,1,67,14
not this year  there will be another ep in the fall though and the other member s solos  starting with chaeng ,1,110,20
ros  though  i hope they change it up like her first teaser photo ,1,66,13
lol there s really a remix of 4d   but anyway we are having 4 new songs to go  excited ,1,87,19
my heart      we are getting 4 new songs and a remix  square up was just 4  but we loved it  let s love this ep even more  with the global attention blackpink has received since square up  i think they may be smashing records again  let s hope kill this love makes it to the top 10 of the global billboard chart  support and love for blackpink is support and love for everyone  they ve worked extremely hard  so please don t be mean based on yg s actions  love blackpink  and you will be loved      kill this love everyone    ,1,526,97
i am so excited     five new songs      dddd is one of my absolute top favorite songs  period  by any artist  so i am open to hearing a remix  it could be super fun  and it s so basically new  i love that we have track names now  ngl  a midnight release is amazing news too  not only do we get it sooner  but i don t have to get up at 5 a m  to hear it  which i was 100  still planning to do lol   if there are any other est blinks reading this  it s 11 a m  our time ,1,468,97
i guess it s all a out perspective because i considered jennie s solo being fed a four course meal in november so it s been more like 5 months for me  i realize it was one song by one member  but she killed it ,1,210,41
you mean it s not an acoustic version  lol,1,42,8
4 songs and a remix  are they ever going to release a full studio album ,1,72,15
oh yessss    i m in western usa so it s super fun for me to stay up late for bp music to drop  i remember doing that for aiiyl ,1,127,27
ros  is my  bias  because i love her voice and emotive singing  she has the best accent in the world  she can play guitar and piano  she seems really thoughtful and is the most introverted of the four which is endearing  i really like all of them though  ros  just somehow was the one i intrinsically had the biggest connection to from the get go  sometimes one cannot explain why exactly  d ,1,392,72
absolutely loving these visuals  can t wait to hear the new songs ,1,66,11
jennie is my bias but rose is looking ridiculously good in this comeback ,1,73,13
have any sites announced a pre order yet or is this going to be a digital only release  i ve not seen anything concrete either way ,1,131,24
are we getting a physical album or not ,1,39,8
excellent now we can get a full lp comeback in 2021,1,51,11
oh yeah  few new songs ,1,23,5
no negativity on the reddit forum please  we all should be happy they are even dropping a comeback with how busy they are  ,1,123,23
i d have to say mine is jennie  she s beautiful  has powerful stage charisma  our taste in fashion are similar  and it s nice to have a petite boss woman to look up to and get inspiration from   ,1,195,37
exactly  so 2 mini albums equals 1 western artists album  some western artists come out with an album every 2 3 years  so 8 10 songs every 2 3 years     oh wait     kinda like bp  see  not a big deal  ,1,201,37
hope the sub title is as good or even better than forever young,1,63,13
i m happy we re getting new songs  of course i do wish there were more  but i m hyped as fuck anyway   but lmao   that d4 remix ugh ,1,132,27
if 4 new songs is all we can get then i ll take them and love them with my whole heart  also this styling plus jennie bangs     ,1,128,27
so are we ever going to get a way to actually buy the album or       jesus  they look so great though  let me buy their album already yg jesus ,1,143,29
queens  look at them doubling their discography in one year   we have a full album worth of songs now    being a blink is hard    ,1,130,25
name a couple of your favorite artists that isn t kpop  how often do you get new music from them  maybe once a year  maybe  i don t see the big deal  especially after this is what said would happen  they re probably going to drop an album next  with the solos dropped along the way  ,1,283,53
we officially need more than two hands to count all the songs boys and girls     ,1,81,16
ight thx,1,8,2
if r tee is involved in all the songs this definitely will be really good ,1,74,14
do you even hear yourself you re rationalizing being fed rations eight months after the last release which was equally sparse four songs is a  tiny  ep,1,151,26
  elaborate  ,1,13,2
no this is 4 new songs which will hopefully all be just as amazing as the 9 songs we got so far ,1,96,22
12 midnight,1,11,2
so for me  release time is 9am  mountain standard time  on the 4th  ,1,68,13
we re actually lucky to get new songs as is  north america tour sold out with no new material on the horizon  ,1,110,21
this is midnight korea time right ,1,34,6
wtf is 0am tho  ,1,16,4
jennie killing it with the wigs    ,1,35,7
how many times this girls gonna change their hairstyle this era im here for it ,1,79,15
my heart has stopped beating  ,1,30,6
always kst,1,10,2
i expected 4 songs an english version of the title track so i was close  maybe it s an english remix of d4  anyways jennie attacked me with that hair  ,1,151,29
kst i would assume,1,18,4
with the na tour about to kick off  do you guys think any song will be completely english  subtitle ,1,100,19
as a blink  this is waste ,1,26,6
jennie back at it again with the bangs    ,1,42,9
which timezone for that 0am ,1,28,5
0am release  not 6pm as usual,1,29,6
this styling but i cackled on that 4d remix lol cant wait for this songs we have 13 songs now hahaha,1,100,21
i assume the names below the songs are the producers or something ,1,66,12
ddu du ddu du remix lmaooooo im lit for masta wu tho,1,52,12
oh yes,1,6,2
was hoping for 5 new ones  but i hope this remix is dope  i m super excited  maybe the sub title song is a ballad  ,1,115,23
4 new songs as expected  i can live with it  d the girls looks absolutely amazing btw  o,1,88,18
jennieeeee omggg that black hairrrr,1,35,5
my poor wig ,1,12,3
one the axs site   accessible seating for blackpink all tickets offered through this link are intended for customers with disabilities and their companions ,1,156,22
most likely  jennie skipped music core for the first week so sbs inkigayo would be the first performance ,1,105,18
hashtag emoji  hashflag  costs a minimum of  1 million for every campaign  so i think lisa probably gets more than  500k ,1,121,21
oh yeah for sure  it s the most basic form of photoshop but it s also the cheapest  the point is just to put the product and the girls there and that s it  that way the company still has an ad and it cost them nothing  a lot of commercials have absolutely abysmal photoshopping because it s just not worth it to spend so much money on an ad you won t see for very long ,1,369,72
this is really bad photoshop when its so obvious they are not standing next to the car  they didn t even bother to match the lighting  ,1,135,25
get that coin lisa,1,18,4
resident blink 2,1,16,3
yg being korean thanos,1,22,4
if anybody needs me  my funeral will be open casket next tuesday at five pm  i request everyone smack me with a blink hammer at least once  ,1,140,27
i have a  150 ticket for the newark concert if anyone is interested,1,67,13
i sadly do not know the answers  i think the best bet for your first question would be to try and get in contact with the company which provides the tickets  that is the only 100  way to know  i hope you can see blackpink and hope to see some post of yours after you experienced them  some little report how it was    maybe someone can answer your 2nd question  there surely have to be some other ada ticket users in this community  wish you the best ,1,451,88
i remember looking at ariana and bts tickets and the wheelchair accessible seats came with a companion seat  so most likely   you couldn t buy one without the other i believe     you might have to buy both  but as far as i remember they re a pair  hope this helps       ,1,270,50
hey  i know april fools is right around the corner  we will be allowing memes  but not yet because of a possible teaser in about 2 hrs  pleeease wait ,1,150,29
the last 2 months have been very nice we finally got my healthcare sorted with the government after 2 years of trying to have it approved  k pop has really helped me through this time i have a huge playlist that i shuffle through when i drive with my mum  she went from  not knowing or caring about k pop  to now humming along to certain songs and even asking some questions from time to time  ,1,394,74
i don t know the answers to your questions  sorry  but i feel very bad for you and hope you live a beautiful life and stay healthy   ,1,133,27
which hk movies are good these days  i used to watch them religiously up until about 2005 when mainland china started taking all their talent and it just became terrible  i ve been hoping it can come back but always had very little hope ,1,237,43
i can t wait  this looks epic ,1,30,6
it turns out the performance on the music core will not be ,1,59,12
such a cute episode  i liked seeing lisa and rose s bond and i hope in another episode they show jennie and jisoo  i m so looking forward to the next episode  these diaries have been so lovely to watch  i wonder if they ll release them on a box set or something in the future ,1,276,53
i m gonna have to make a blackpink end game poster now,1,54,11
blackpink is the new fantastic four ,1,36,6
\[offtopic\] the wandering earth was also quite well received in hong kong too  but yes you are right  most of the mainland chinese films were quite bad  and in the past 10 years  as hk s movie industry was in trouble for finding investments  many hk movies had to cooperate with mainland chinese productions  and the overall quality of many hk movies has been decreased since then  though there are now some new local hopes for hk movies  ps  i really admire you for even knowing something about movies of hong kong and china  adore,1,533,94
bye bye,1,7,2
oh cool  i didn t know that  thank you  ,1,40,8
this is old news now  it has already been addressed ,1,52,10
if you still want to have the song in your playlist  you can save the kyocera concert live version  it s obviously not as good as a proper  crisp music file  but for anyone looking for more bp songs  it s something ,1,215,40
bp and inkigayo  name a more iconic duo ,1,40,8
gospel stage for four angelic beings  ,1,38,7
i thought it was  but then they remove it from spotify and made me think it is not ,1,83,18
blackpink  endgame,1,18,2
nah chinese movies are usually bad and some only do well in china  most of the high grossing movies in china are still imports from america  this movie was the first china made blockbuster to get positive reception internationally although it didn t make much overseas as most the box office gross was still in china but it s seen as a positive first step for their movie industry  although i have my doubts they can be a force in the movie industry internationally  not with restricting creativity through censorship  ,1,519,88
i think i ve heard of the movie  isn t it the one where they try to move the earth with giant rockets or something  the chinese movie industry is killing it at the moment  i m pretty sure that like 3 of the top 5 highest grossing movies of this year so far are chinese made ,1,274,54
they re gonna kill the game like armageddon,1,43,7
omg  i d pay you one meeeellion dollars if you painted the rest of her   ,1,73,15
just to provide context  it s made by a chinese fan and it s based on a recently released chinese blockbuster [movie]   that s being very well received internationally ,1,168,26
i just saw this on instagram  i think this is my favourite so far  having said that i m not sure if these ladies are saving the world from burning or the ones setting the world ablaze  i m here for either honestly ,1,214,41
it looks so pretty  i wonder what else umg has planned    ,1,58,12
i wonder if it s really a custom emoji for lisa  how they manage to do that    ,1,79,17
yeah next teaser probably in like 9 hours  hopefully the title list this time  d really excited as well  i love the event feeling  everyone just waiting for the comeback to finally be released with each day having a small gift people can get even more excited over  d it s great ,1,279,51
i agree it does make the fan base look bad and i agree they maybe a minority but their so loud and determined to be as toxic as possible  while mouthing off about how much they care and that s why they do what they do  people totally need to be more chill  i mean i m as excited as the next person  it s only been 2 days since the last teaser and next week we are going to get a load of stuff fo be excited about  i m so pumped i m struggling to sleep  ,1,453,93
it was originally a wonder girls song but the bp version is so heavily remixed and the lyrics are mostly different it might as well be a bp song at this point  ,1,160,32
this belongs in a museum ,1,25,5
maybe a stupid question  but is that music from that show or is that music from bp s new song ,1,94,19
it is just a very loud minority  i am aware of that but it still makes the whole fanbase look bad because even a minority is rather large when we are talking about this fanbase  d it is especially a bad look because it really is only about there not being teasers for 2 days  i get that blinks would want the time till the comeback to be used 100   but still     sometimes i d want people to be a little more chill ,1,415,82
i was super stoked to see that anda would be releasing more music sooner than i expected  then to see blinks moaning that it s not bp related breaks my heart and embarrasses me a little  having said that there is still alot of support from blinks  more positive than negative but still disappointing ,1,300,53
i really hope the tracklist drops tomorrow  i m desperate to know how many songs will be on this ep  i m setting my expectations on 4 but hoping for more ,1,154,29
now i wonder if it would that amazing in real life as well  maybe we will find out someday  d,1,93,20
oh shoot lololol i didnt know you were pointing out format  thank you  ,1,71,14
np  but subreddit rule 3    yymmdd    ,1,38,8
hi  just following the date at eastern countries  ,1,50,9
nasa harap na naman si jennie,1,29,6
cuz photoshop  they re all added in later and i m assuming the person adding all the girls didn t bother looking up their actual heights,1,136,23
why is rosie so short considering she s the tallest member of bp,1,64,12
i think it s pretty weird tbh  the whole  shipping idols  culture is honestly just really weird to me  these are actual  real people  not some characters intended for entertainment  if they re gay or not  it s up to them to come out of the closet  and pushing our own ideas of their sexuality    especially when they re originating from a country that is not the best regarding same sex relationships anyway    is just     wrong  in so many ways ,1,446,79
her beautiful arm has been smoothed and trimmed like crazy by photoshop  look at her elbow and forearm bicep ratio  she s thin  but that arm is not her real arm ,1,161,29
oh wow the hashtag even has it s own [emoji on twitter]  ,1,57,11
simple answer   no is it their remix   yes,1,42,8
not hamilton  ontario  though      oh  well  ,1,45,7
this was the vibe i thought they d put on ros  ,1,47,10
blackpink in yo area,1,20,4
ya the rumor says its  500 000,1,30,6
the so hot remix that blackpink sing is a blackpink song  so hot is a wonder girls song  the whole song won t ever be blackpink s because well  it isn t their song  it wasn t a song made for them  nor do they promote and sell it really ,1,236,46
yeah [here]  ,1,13,2
i like this kind of art where it looks like a painting and not someone trying to make it look like a real photograph ,1,117,24
[source]   some are saying she she will be payed  550k  which will be the highest they paid for someone to sponser them ,1,120,22
what do you mean ,1,17,4
offf so pump now thought inki gonna ditched em after all the drama this is my fav stage from all their live performances cant wait ,1,131,25
the pool scene is way to much for weak heart and blood pressure  i was not ready  ,1,82,18
i ve seen english version of this too ,1,38,7
their not messing about with that set  it s about to get real  so excited ,1,74,14
so it s german,1,14,3
my haircuts have been trash for years so i wouldn t hesitate getting a haircut from jennie  then again have lisa on standby just in case lol  ros  sounded incredible in the rehearsal and just gets me more excited for her solo song hopefully later this year  the concerts look so damn incredibly fun  i really hope once chase center is finished in sf  they can have a concert here  those babypink dolls were cute too  somewhat sad we never got to see lisa covering drake s in my feelings  oh well  ros  panic picking paper all 3 rounds in rock paper scissors is definitely a mood  sad we didn t get much jisoo this episode  but definitely excited to go shopping with her and see behind the scenes of their mini  us tv tour  ,1,723,132
omg yasssss it s really happening    ,1,37,6
i think you can consider it as a blackpink song since it s heavily remixed  whether this translates into it  technically  being their song  we don t know since we don t have the legal agreement between tbl and jyp  i d assume they wouldn t be able to make money off of streaming numbers and so  but have the right to perform the remix anywhere  ,1,345,61
200iq strategy obviously  saving rock  amp  scissors for when it really matters ,1,80,12
oh okay thanks i didn t know i always see him posting about bp but i didn t know that,1,85,17
y all  that set  ,1,17,3
it s finally happening ,1,23,3
rosie always picks [paper]  ,1,28,4
are you trying to murder is by making that ,1,43,9
i forgot to add the date but they will have a special comeback performance on april 7 on the show ,1,98,20
i haven t watched this programme before  does it mean that bp will perform on this show soon ,1,93,17
the set is insane       ,1,24,5
the hype is real  ,1,18,4
maybe they from the future o o,1,30,6
i didn t know i needed this until i saw it  thank you,1,53,12
cover title reads  four girls enchant the whole world ,1,54,9

actress yoo in na from the drama  touch your heart  who had their season finale this month  i suspect jennie will get her  1 back next month ,1,141,27
okay thanks  yeah  she was in goblin and is lead in a series that i think just finished  so it makes sense that s she s popular right now  jennie seems to maintain a high spot in these lists  regardless of activity  ,1,216,40
yoo in na  she s an actress under yg,1,36,7
who is number 1  just curious who she is compared to  ,1,54,11
apparently she [always choose paper]    ,1,40,6
spoiler  ros  s rehearsal is just the same as concert version ,1,62,10
thanks umg ,1,11,2
frick i want blackpink in myyy area    ,1,39,8
yay babypink  really happy to see them  also lisa won  i don t know why i felt so good      ,1,92,20
the part with ros  and lisa in the pool is so adorable  ,1,56,12
you might want to contact ticketmaster to confirm but i believe your ticket is floor ga w  soundcheck ,1,102,18
ah i see  is doesn t say vip and on the section part it says ga sc  ,1,68,15
this is awesome  thank you for sharing ,1,39,7
so now i know ros  the type to think before playing scissors paper rock,1,71,14
no  there is the send off part where you could see them off but they aren t doing a meet and greet ,1,99,21
don t know if you still need help but the ticket does say vip under the event code  if you can t find it then check your section it should say ga1sc  also  my guess is that the goodies will be given out at the venue  i think they will release more information closer to the concert day ,1,286,56
that pool scene is everything and needs to be longer ,1,53,10
maybe on monday  people are saying that yg will release it when the stocks trading are open ,1,92,17
anything to do with the us is umg yeah ,1,39,9
  is this umg s doing  i would freak if i saw the pinks being advertised in my area lol  ,1,89,19
she picked paper 3 times  lisa figured her out  lol ,1,52,10
i m so envious of the bond that rosie and lisa have  7 year friendship y all    these tour diaries have been such a treat  someone on twitter had compiled several instances of rosie playing rps with the girls and she literally throws paper everytime lmao  yet she s shocked she loses   ,1,286,50
when you ,1,9,2
 keke do you love me  the maknae line is so fun to watch  can t wait for the u s  episode  ,1,91,19
literally the cutest angel uwu i m crying ,1,42,7
yeah they have a whole release schedule layed out for the comeback  all this whining is not a good look for this fanbase  wish they would just chill and enjoy the content we re getting and we ll get a whole lot more in the month they have ahead ,1,245,47
i m just joking  not upset  sorry if i was too ambiguous ,1,57,11
they have a schedule for these things  now you can disagree with not dropping anything comeback related at the weekend  but that won t change their strategy  all the blinks on twitter who think that responding to any tweet which isn t about the comeback  including a tweet about winner and anda  makes sense  well they are wrong and in fact it makes blinks look bad as well   ,1,376,67

a video teaser today is asking too much ,1,40,8
that reminded me so much about the time she couldn t pick the bedroom during blackpink house  d girl  the first choice is basically random unless you played a lot against lisa before \^\^   but that s our ros  ,1,210,38
rosie getting anxiety on not know what to pick for rock paper scissors is me lololol ,1,85,16
i love the girls  but i wouldn t let them cut my hair haha  ros  feeling the song even in the rehearsal  she is just a perfectionist isn t she  these rehearsal events look so fun  a little more intimate than the actual concert  babypink in your area  damn that was adorable haha  ,1,280,51

not surprised  just watched an older episode of hello and i forgot his name but he s in a popular group and he said a chinese fan attempted to buy him a 300k super car because she heard him mention he doesn t have a car in an interview     so he had to stop her and deny it  man  the rich chinese are on another level spending wise  ,1,333,67

did i just stumble into a new quentin tarantino film ,1,53,10
i see  how come lol ,1,20,5
hahaha  actually there is a real first post about halsey s tweet before  but i keep getting downvotes  i think it s because my bad grammar      so deleted it and reposted this with more information ,1,198,33
they really are friends  it s a pity she and bp can t meet on this year s coachella ,1,84,16
halsey responded to rosie   ,1,28,4

she is a blink ,1,15,4
b c i m always impressed with c fans and their hard work  and i like lisa i took a look at what else they did this year  for her birthday they also   gt did a support video in cafes across south korea that were 30 seconds long 100 times during the day  gt did a support video that was 30 seconds long on a bangkok commercial center s led screen   gt donated 50 kilograms of pet food and 1327 yaun to help stray animals in bejing   gt did a vertical screen support message in gangnam   gt put up 560 screen support messages on self serving ticket machines in korea   gt put up 21 led billboards in china s central business district at 15 seconds per and 120 times a day per ad   gt they held a coffee event for blinks for her birthday in shanghai where you could get a special coffee sleeve with her photo   gt they donated money to a medical institution in thailand  i think this describes how much power c k fans really have that i fans don t always get to see  they do so much and they re really amazing in their organization and it s always fun to observe them from any fandom how they tailor charity gifts to the idol they support as well as picking out gifts  this might be the last year or two that blackpink accepts presents  really  ,1,1241,221
she is a pure soul   ,1,21,6
next month  blackpink  twice  izone  in that order for me ,1,58,10
ros  sang her song at japan concert at first  halsey [commented under her instagram post]   later  and then ros  released studio version  eyes closed   now this  she and bp really share some connections ,1,203,33
damn cblinks are stacked ,1,25,4
this girl won the kpop fandom and im here for it ,1,49,11

omg halsey stop being so beautiful   ,1,37,7
you don t need to be a vocal expert to notice this sounded like a bad karaoke at a cheap bar  its sad because i love them and hate that others are right when critizing them  apart from ros   its like they stopped practicing vocally ever since they became big ,1,259,49
use seatgeek  reliable trustworthy tickets  and the tickets are cheap,1,69,10

can someone please link me to the top left photo ,1,49,10
r blackpink always surprises me with its content and designs ,1,61,9
that s cool  ,1,13,2
 ready to be downvoted  in fact you will never know how their real personal lives are  and  no offense  my advice is  it should be better that you care more about yourself  your family and friends  though i understand fans always care a lot about the idols they are stanning  ,1,276,50
officer yes  this post right here ,1,34,6
you re thinking too much  ,1,26,4
yg can t mistreat them  espicially now  these girls are the ones who are saving yg right now  i believe the more popular a group becomes  the more respect they gain from their agency  ,1,184,33
i hope it happens  ,1,19,4
sin city  kia this love,1,23,5
koreans are not as touchy with strangers as people from other cultures  even though she s lived abroad she might not fill comfortable with the arm around her shoulders  his hug looks very friendly and respectful tho  i believe is just a matter of cultural differences  ,1,269,45

hottest she s looked yet i think   phew ,1,40,7
is it just me or does she look uncomfortable with pharell ,1,58,11
i believe it s one of chanel x pharrell s piece ,1,48,9
would love to see them on knowing bros again i thought they had great chemistry with everyone ,1,94,17
doubt it with their north american tour sched too packed maybe some american talk show hopefully ,1,97,16
so does that make you toxic  but for real i saw the  itzy being the next blackpink  not so much them copying them  guess it just doesn t make sense because bp was first  ,1,170,33
 gt  popularized by bp yeah ppl are copying exid or pristin who s about to disband  ,1,84,16
pristen  exid  even some snsd comebacks  these all came before or right around the time of blackpink hunny  ,1,108,18
because when itzy debuted  in every post  video  picture or anything related to itzy  toxic blinks would say itzy is copying blackpink  ,1,136,22
thanks  what a cute interaction,1,31,5
actress from goblin yeah  ,1,26,4
is that the actress kim go eun with her ,1,40,9
i never would have thought a bathrobe could even be a fashion thing  maybe it ll be a fashion trend now that jennie s wearing it ,1,129,24
took me a couple times to notice that she is wearing a bathrobe and scarf  jennie is fashion personified ,1,105,19
loved that outfit on her ,1,25,5
i think they might be on idol room  i think idol room usually is prerecorded before the comeback happens  i wouldn t count on it though,1,135,25
yeah apparently there are more  older  people here than i thought  that s pretty amazing ,1,89,14
now that we re talking about variety shows  check out our variety show   tv apperances list [here]     not 100   but working on it ,1,131,24
even when they re fully available they barely do them so i doubt it ,1,68,13
i feel your pain  if rosie wasn t australian there would be no way they d be coming here ,1,89,17
me too  d4 came up in my recommendations on yt and i ve never looked back ,1,74,15
a lisa vikander and anja jennie jolie 5555,1,42,6
too late    next time ,1,22,5
especially when all the clothing trends that you see in girl crush today was started by bp  d,1,93,18
apparently everyone have the same first thought  their stylists really do a great job so far ,1,93,16
most likely not  they re schedule is packed ,1,44,7
oh damn  this may be too late but a question about favorite music genre other than kpop would be cool to see as well ,1,117,24
highly unlikely because those shows don t film that far in advance ,1,67,11
trying not to scream out loud while i m at this bar having a drink    ,1,70,14
damn they have a techwear vibe going on here  i need this comeback nao   ,1,73,14
i get your sarcasm but why would anyone actually say this  which is probably why you were downvoted    ,1,103,18
that s what i thought as soon as i saw the picture   reminds me of tomb raider  ,1,80,16
how come jennie is the only one who doesn t look like lara croft ,1,65,13
the photoshopping is kinda weird ,1,33,5
lol so cool,1,11,3
 hi friends  i just got my autorization to take some days off from work  so i ll be going to los angeles the same week the concert is held  now i have buy it from retailers  can you please recommend me a page  viagogo and stubhub are trustable  i m from colombia so i m not related with any of this  and i really don t want to get scammed  i also entered the facebook group where people sell buy tickets for the show  but again  i don t know how trustable could be that  ,1,471,89
hi friends  i just got my autorization to take some days off from work  so i ll be going to los angeles the same week the concert is held  since i couldn t get the tickets in advance because i didn t know if i was going to be able to travel  now i have to buy it from retailers  can you please recommend me a page  viagogo and stubhub are trustable  i m from colombia so i m not related with any of this  and i really don t want to get scammed  i also entered the facebook group where people sell buy tickets for the show  but again  i don t know how trustable could be that  thanks  and i m sorry if this is not the place to ask this,1,634,124
it makes me want to meetup with all the  oldies  at the atl show  as long as people don t stare at me like i m an undercover cop  i m fine   that has happened and it was a terrible feeling  ha  ,1,194,39
ah  a fellow 35 er  i ll be there in la  gotta stick together  ,1,63,12
can ros  just choke me,1,22,5
come thru lisa floor hump     wow this was a great performance ,1,63,11
lmao same 2 years ago  one of the best reasons to get into more groups is that ll you ll almost always have something to look forward to,1,136,26
only my 2nd comeback couldn t imagine being the ones who were waiting on them since 2012 ,1,89,15
i would like to think so and i think fact fully they are i think more people responds to blackpink compared to twice or red velvet etc,1,134,26
sure for example really toxic people on social media are probably too obsessed  that s a good example  if i had to guess that is what bp will do a lot now  comeback and then tour around the world and in sea especially  would you say that blackpink is the most popular kpop girlgroup in your country ,1,299,56
and that wasn t even an actual  ban  basically just a guideline set by jyp that he hoped they would follow  he even said so himself that he can t prevent them from dating ,1,171,32
blackpink is copying itzy,1,25,4
i started kpop with ses ,1,24,5
i m not sure if this is what you meant as being too obsessed   kpop stans being really toxic like in a serious situation you seen those  if you stanned ____ x wouldnt have happened  something like that  they really got their minds drilled into i m not sure what it s into  could be coming back next year according to my friend ros  said they re coming back next year i think,1,374,69
possibly blonde wig in mv but her real hair is still dark  ,1,59,12
it s my first comeback too  amp  here i thought i was the oldest  turning 39 in july  but i am so glad that bp s fandom is so diverse and growing    i actually was recommended momoland s fbe video on youtube and got to googling  found blackpink  watched dddd  amp  haven t looked back since  i am now completely obsessed and even have their billboard displayed in my office office  ps  i love watching reaction to blackpink videos  it makes me giddy to see people enjoying like i do  ,1,484,87
wait  you just made me rewatch whistle mv lol,1,45,9
my bet is on pretending like nothing happened at all  that s so more like mr  yang hyun suk,1,91,17
i mean that wasn t directed at you in particular  but that s definitely a thing these days  people being too into their favorite thing and neglecting other things for it  anyway  bp got so much more confident with their live performances  i think they said they will come to sea again  soon  as well  hope you can catch them whenever that happens  d,1,349,62
i wonder if when he does finally post something if he will pretend like nothing has been happening or if he will post a statement ,1,130,25
not gonna lie you had me in the first half,1,42,10
not at all  these idols are extremely valuable to the company and driving increases risk of something happening to them several fold  ,1,134,21
reaction channels seem to be really popular and reacting to bp definitely brings in the clicks as well  d gonna check that one out to get a better idea ,1,152,29
oh i see no of course i maintain the balance no worries i understand and we all live in reality    off the topic here but i never get tired of their live performances and their way of reaching out to blinks hence the respect for them    ,1,237,46
from watching the reaction to their mv dddd by the fine bros    ,1,64,13
well one can be too obsessed with their hobby where it becomes unhealthy  like with everything in life  one wants a nice balance of things  like as an example  it would be probably bad if one follows bp that much that they have no life outside of that anymore  it being a really big interest is fine ofc  i also respect them a lot  they feel very genuine and down to earth even though they realistically are big stars ,1,418,79
did they actually drive  ,1,25,4
i hold a lot of admiration qnd respect for them    although i don t quite understand what you mean by being too obsessed  magic in the air,1,138,27
yeah blackpink is definitely a gateway into kpop as well  though i think they will always stay my favorite group  hard to imagine otherwise  i also really like bigbang  their stage presence is unrivaled in kpop  i hope they can work without seungri  we will see  i am a metal fan  which makes it even weirder that i like bp that much  d,1,336,63
i am also pretty deep into the rabbithole that is blackpink  always important to not get too obsessed though but i am sure you have a healthy balance there  d anyway  it is great to see that the girls can do that for people  that s real life magic if you ask me  ,1,263,52
don t ros  and jisoo drive the mini cooper in the whistle m v ,1,62,12
if yg was george lucas  he would update the whistle video to have them driving this instead of the mini ,1,104,20
the power blackpink holds     i m really proud of them   ,1,57,10
i spent my holidays watching their weekly idol and other shows watched as many vlives as i found i followed a lot of fanpages of them and i m glad they posted old vlives videos  amp  photos  i really turned crazy for them my wallpapers are them everytime i see a photocard of them i ll surely get them if i can  who knew even though i won t be able to interact with them or something i ll still get the light i need by simply listening watching them  they didn t kill this love they brought me love ,1,499,87
37 here so i m pretty sure i ll be one of the old fogies at the concert haha,1,76,17
expect to be super stoked    ,1,29,6
my story is really similar with yours  i never really liked kpop before blackpink  but after dddd i was hooked and watched more of their mvs  then discovered blackpink house and down the hole i went  ,1,200,36
most of us thought lisa was jennie   lisa is rocking those space buns ,1,70,14
thanks man  coachella is always a blast even  i m more into electronic music hip hop in general  i mean i saw them on the coachella lineup  but wasn t remotely interested till i saw them on us tv  then i went down the rabbit hole of all their videos  performances  etc  the other positive thing is that i started checking other groups such as big bang  2ne1 from yg  some bts  exo  and everglow as well hahah ,1,409,75
gotcha thank you  ,1,18,3
the result must be interesting ,1,31,5
why did they feel the need to  shop jisoo s knees to oblivion  ,1,63,12
hi  if there anyone would like to watch the bp show in prudential center in newark  in 2th may  i want to resell the ticket at a very low price because i bought the ga floor ticket too  can deal with seatgeek or other apps  the seat is no 3 row3  section lower level 20  thank you    if you want it  contact me freely ,1,318,63
newly minted 30 year old here  i used to listen to kpop about 10 years ago and stopped afterjyp shipped the wonder girls off to the us   rip  last june i accidentally came across blackpink s cover performance of so hot when i was reminiscing about wg and the rest was history lol  ,1,281,52
i hope your right but it s an ep  that s 6 tracks at most  i m still very excited  don t get me wrong  it s just that i think i m more excited last year since it s my first  and i do not know what to expect  ,1,208,43
holy fuck i am genuinely not prepared for this,1,46,9
definitely third ed ,1,20,2
i can t wait to hear the song and see the choreo   i miss the girls,1,67,15
lisa looks so adorable omg ,1,27,5
i want that car    ,1,19,5
ngl  love jennie but this time they re kinda right    her vocal color didn t quite match with the song  and it appeared she struggled a bit with maintaining volume   we barely hear her at one part ,1,197,35
i hope they sell merch online in a preorder type fashion  buying at the venue is not fun lol but with just a few weeks until the us tour starts  i hope they announce something soon ,1,181,36
first as well  i listened to kpop back in 2009 but stopped after i graduated high school in  11  i literally found bp because of a dance emote that came out on fortnite  i instantly thought it looked like kpop and looked it up  i think it was a part of lisa from aiiyl and now i fell back in love with kpop  ,1,308,63
this is great to hear  finding something which gives you happiness is essential in live  glad that bp could do that for you    if you haven t already  check out their vlives  especially really old ones  some really wholesome content in there ,1,242,42
haha exactly,1,12,2
yeah that makes sense  i think there is still a kpop touch to it  especially in the form of shaking things up during the song  i personally love that ,1,150,29
the original photo was released as 9 separate images on instagram  i think op or someone else quickly removed the white space between them to get one completed look  check out [ kia_onbeat]   and it will make more sense  ,1,221,38
the 3 years thing was twice s rule  i never heard it applying to blackpink  ,1,76,14
my second  too  but for some reason i am waaaaaaay more hyped for this one  maybe it s wishful thinking that we ll get more than 4 songs this time  ,1,148,28
second bp comeback for me  and yes  it really is this hype every time  i discovered them right before aiiyl dropped and then the 364 day drought happened  lol so i actually think i was more excited for square up  if that s even possible   at least this time around they were touring and we knew yg was probably obligated to release this before coachella and the us tour  last time we had the unexplained hiatus and the comeback literally got pushed back like 4 times  but either way i m still so freaking excited and i start getting antsy around 7 30 every day now waiting for another teaser to drop   i really think this might be bp s best comeback yet and they ve gotta go big this time around which makes it even more hype  i still can t believe i m gonna get to see them live next month t__t,1,795,147
yes with the lara croft realness  this comes out on my bf s birthday and i already told him that we can celebrate a different day because his b day happens every year but a blackpink comeback is once in a lifetime         ,1,222,41
so is jennie going to be blonde or not ,1,39,9
there is a merch store when they were in my country  but it maybe cheaper if you order online  ,1,95,19
but aren t we going to kill this love  mixed signals  haha,1,58,11
believe me  here in thailand  it s not that expensive and not as difficult as you imagine  she was back here visiting her family several times since she started training  without managers  plenty of time an opportunities  many kids here can obtain licenses without driving skills  if you can manage an easy parking  you ll get it  ,1,331,55
mygosh 4 gorgeous lara croft  can t waiiiiit for next week      ,1,64,11
hehe  d it is awesome though  diversity in the community is neat  how did you get aware they exist ,1,99,19
weird photoshopping of jennie s right leg   ,1,44,6
lisa looks so fucking adorable with that hair ,1,46,8
it s a luxury to even own a car and drive in thailand and the roads are dangerous  are you trying to make my point  lol  and how would this apply to korea where she s banned from driving ,1,187,37
at the risk of sounding like an  anti  i think there are a lot of legitimate criticisms when it comes to the  i can t take my eyes off of you  cover  i assume she loves the song but it just doesn t really seem to fit her voice that well  at least not the way she s singing here  i don t think there was anything wrong with her solo performance at all and props to her for actually singing live  but i ll just say i wasn t surprised or even upset when i saw how  felt about it  jennie got a ton of undeserved hate there for that whole  lazy  thing which  was  ridiculous but in  this case  i don t think it s just  bp antis  ,1,624,122
i m so excited  it has indeed that tomb raider vibe  that set looks amazing honestly  i m hoping that we will get album design reveal and or preorders notice next ,1,163,26
i started listening to blackpink and kpop after the kda pop stars performance for lol worlds ,1,93,16
that is a really big reason i stan blackpink  they seem really genuine and down to earth ,1,89,17
an ethnicity option would be cool ,1,34,6
oh yes of course  bigbang is a global thing  i hope bp could be even bigger  like they could take part in more social activities if they could or even other types of entertainment aspects like movies or tv dramas  but of course music should still be their first priority and bp s songs are really in high quality ,1,313,58
i am the exact same as you as much as i m hyped for avengers this is my first blackpink comeback and this is what i m most excited for in april  i also would not have believed this one year ago ,1,194,40
lol this is thailand we re talking about  have you ever been on thai roads ,1,75,14
you are in for a treat then couz every comeback they have never disappoints it takes time compare to other group but its always worth it ,1,137,26
yeah  and also you add a year when the new year starts  there have been many people speaking out about changing this system  for example  psy is was born on december 31  1977 which means two days after he was born he was considered a two year old  if they change it  everybody gets like 2 years younger lmao,1,307,59
best to avoid that place  you can sense their fear with this comeback ,1,70,13
and of course all the  vocal experts  on  are ripping the performance apart,1,75,13
i find most kpop music inferior to yg s music  the last group i really loved was bigbang but they went into the army  if bp were to disband tomorrow i would be done with kpop for good ,1,184,37
i m with you  ,1,14,4
i actually listened to come back home before  but as i didn t like kpop at that time i didn t have any special feelings about it  no offense but in fact until now i still find some of the styles of kpop artists  mostly male  too  foppish   though their songs are not bad  ,1,272,52
you should listen to 2ne1 songs  teddy exclusively produced most of their music and you ll the influence of that carried onto bp ,1,129,22
no wonder as i listen to more bp and songs of other yg artists  i have a feeling that these pop songs are not that  kpop  ,1,122,26
you can t just take a drivers test without practicing lol  when did she have time for that  yg forbids them to drive b c they can get into accidents  it s in the contract ,1,171,32
    jisoo wearing it  ,1,22,4
wait members wore krunk  i wished krunk appeared during their concert in my country but no   ,1,93,17
i think she got a license in thailand  it only takes a couple of days off her visiting home  and it s not difficult to get an international driving license after that ,1,167,31
anyone interested in tagging along for the show in paris  don t really have friends who are into kpop  don t wanna go alone tho  pm dm me ,1,138,25
it s crazy how i used to dislike kpop 3 years ago then that same year i discovered twice and i thought okay it s not bad it was a month after dddd i discovered blackpink i immediately starting liking bp at first i stan jisoo because of her beauty her humour her vocals and everything about her then i discovered blackpink house last year september and watched a family being so happy together i started to stan all of them as every each one of them brought me back up to my feet it may be exaggerating or whatsoever when i say they really changed my life because they did i m mad blackpink makes me happy  amp  calm again i m sad  blackpink does it again i m really into blackpink and this is my first ever blackpink comeback and i m so excited  every teaser they post i share it on instagram on twitter  unfortunately i missed their concert this year and hopefully they ll be back in singapore next year ,1,905,150
haha  funny and very siily tbh,1,30,6
yes  i agree  which is why i m hoping the blonks don t try to ruin what could be something amazing for the future  pharrell is an incredible asset to have  they seem to be on the blacklabel studio  so  shouldn t be too surprising if we ended up with a song  i would love a jenlisa sub unit w  pharrell producing  ,1,313,58
imagine getting to meet a such a talented and inspirational artist  good for you  pharrell ,1,91,15
they can date now  they have to be debuted for 3 years in order for the ban to be lifted  idk about the others ,1,111,24
already iconic  i don t even know what i would do if they ended up collabing  like  this is next level ishhh  ,1,110,21
i love how confident she became  solo was the best thing that ever happened to her  you can see how much shes grown  she is confident in her talent  you can see how happy she is when she s performing  happy jen truly is the best jen  ,1,234,46
i think it s considered dangerous ,1,34,5
others are fine but whats wrong with driving ,1,45,8
others are fine but what s wrong with driving  ,1,47,8
drinking  smoking  clubbing  driving  plastic surgery  and dating are all banned according to their contract  ,1,110,15
my babies  honestly  i know that rappers unit is very common in kpop  look no further than the various sub units in yge  but i d totally be down for a sub unit for their sub unit  i think it would actually break the internet  ,1,226,41
they are not allowed to drive ,1,30,6
dua lipa collab started b c jenlisa went to see her at a concert  that s how this stuff happens  by networking  so who knows we might get a collab in the future  they seem to get along well together ,1,199,38
omg  tell me about it  i know they usually go for tone down  more  natural  looking makeup  but this is a look honeeeyyyyy  like  she came thru and deliver  i need more of this in the comeback  ,1,194,37
they all look great but lisa with that hair   ,1,46,10
i know their connection is more fashion oriented  thru chanel   but i ain t gonna lie  i would really be all about a song collab with blackpink  or maybe even a future solo song  imagine something funk and cool  very different than what we expect kpop to be  i would be so down for this  ,1,288,54
i thought lisa was jisoo     lmao,1,33,6
they are not allowed to drive  sad  ,1,36,7
amen  the last thing we need is another dj snake fiasco  do better people ,1,74,14
i would think that jisoo is the most responsible  but she also gets scared easily  lisa jokes around too much and ros  is too busy eating  must be jennie  haha  in reality  i don t think they are allowed to drive as one of the 6 rules they have  ,1,246,48
love this look so much  she looks good  and i love how much she interects with the crazy girls  they seem really close  and i like it  ,1,135,27
jennie kim honey  come thru with that sass    for some reason  i just got remind of bodak yellow  i don t gotta dance  i make money moves   jennie kim making money moves like a boss a\ \  bitch she is   sheisaqueen  itsgonnabeabop  iwantacollabrightnowtobehonest ,1,263,41
i smell amazing collab  let s get the party started peeeeopleee   lisalookssocutehere,1,85,11
yaaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssss honeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyy    come thru with the shoulder action  love her make up here  love what she is wearing  love everything about her tbh   queen,1,187,24
i agree with the other comments  very tomb raider and i m here for it  it s gonna be legen wait for it  daryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy   ,1,135,21
31 here and still kpopping ,1,27,5
it helps their producer teddy grew up in the us so was influenced by american music and culture at a young age  he s been with ygent for a long time and has had heavy influence on the company culture and their music signature  that s why ygent music is very distinct from the kpop industry ,1,290,54
there are so many new blinks   reading through the thread it s so amazing how diverse everyone is in demographics  i ve been into kpop since i was a preteen   10 years  but yes it does feel like this every  single  time  seems like a lot of people experiencing their first comeback and it s gonna be so much fun  lots of new content constantly coming out to keep you on your toes  i still remember where i was and what i was doing and my reactions for all the previous comebacks  it s a great time honestly ,1,507,94
it would be impossible or lisa to have her driver license as she came to korea at a young age  there was a rumour jennie owned a car during her training days but i don t know if that s true ,1,190,39
been here since the beginning whistle era and everything   still get just as excited  if anything  i m even more excited this time around  lol  ,1,144,24
i m all in on these looks  especially lisa give more of that  i m all about those space buns,1,92,18
i was thinking the same thing  ,1,31,6
they nailed that aesthetic jesus christ  i can t fuckin wait   ,1,63,10
asjsjfkkg i m so excited   ,1,27,5
i am an old geezer at 44 lol ,1,29,8
i wonder how many of the redditors on this forum became a blink after watching them on gma  stephen colbert  or other promotions they did in the us back in february  ,1,166,31
i fell down the rabbit hole known as blackpink back in september of last year after watching fine bros did a reaction vid of them with college kids  from that point on i was a blink through and through  this will be my first comeback and to say i am excited is an understatement  end game will be my most anticipated event of april but kill the love comes a very close second  ,1,377,73
most likely both  ,1,18,3
that lisa buns we need more of that seriously ,1,46,9
god bless lisa  what can she not do  ,1,37,9
i really thought that it was jennie who had the space buns  my baby lisa looks good though   ,1,93,19
yg on instagram ban while the girls are doing all the promotion and commercial themselves lmao  ,1,96,17
why  i can t understand  ,1,25,4
30 here  never listened to kpop before  become a blink this year after hearing about jennie s gossip and google who she is  ,1,124,21
lisa has a license i think  ,1,28,6
this comment totally applies to me too  i never thought that i would be excited for a k pop group s comeback a year ago ,1,120,23
so they have there own customised car now  amazing  who will drive  ,1,68,12
also note that this is reddit  so it s going to skew more male than a blink demo survey elsewhere like on twitter ,1,114,22
lots of blinks new to kpop in general  that s pretty cool  and yes  this is how it feels every time heh  kpop is really good at hyping up a groups return to promotions its very involved and there is just a stream of contents made to hype up fans  it s really exciting ,1,268,52
i need more lisa with space buns   ,1,35,8
all i want is love  their outfits are always amazing ,1,53,10
i didn t say people don t think it s her  just he and i don t  i don t need  facts  or anything  you may be right  just stating my opinion that she doesn t sound the same in the 2 clips    and i don t need him to translate thanks  ,1,231,45
maybe ask him to translate every single tweet [here]   for you ,1,63,11
ah well  guess my husband is one of the ones not  ,1,50,11
while most of thais are 100  sure of it ,1,40,9
damn i didn t even check the price tag ufff i see it  i like it  i want it  i can t afford it  i ll stick to my current 4 boards  d ,1,132,30
hmm   i don t know who it is but that wouldn t be my guess   ,1,61,14
tom raider with the korean touch  how badass they look  pheww   they re gonna annihilate love this april ,1,105,17
this song is gonna   kill us all    rip blinks   amp  x200b  ps look at jisoo and lisa wtf ,1,91,17
everything said is so relatable  my first comeback too  last october heared d4 and was hooked  searched everything about the girls listened to all their songs and mvs and dance practice videos and followed them on ig watched blackpink house first without subtitles then with subtitles watched their variety shows and vlives and live performances  everything within couple of weeks  ,1,382,60
i think it s [her]   she s such a blink  ,1,41,8
 gt although the sound effects in the music video were distracting  i don t know if that s common or not  but it was odd to me  yeah that was just a directorial choice i guess  i m happy you liked it though   honestly the whole album is gold  yay iu   ,1,252,47
jisoo giving me some serious underworld vibes  can t wait for this darker looking concept ,1,90,14
thanks for explaining  i saw one youtube thumbnail talking about  lazy dancing scandal  but i hate clickbait titles so i didn t click  it s interesting that there might be something to that  and i hope she is doing alright  i have to admit  i never got the whole concept of rbf  and the idea that you were entitled to someone smiling for no reason  it s pretty discouraging to get downvotes on an open discussion thread as a new fan  i wasn t being combative or asking people to stop  i just genuinely wanted to understand  i appreciate the explanation  i hope she keeps doing what she s doing and that they all get many years of success to come  i have never had a bias as strongly as i have for jennie  the fact that she has an incredible voice  can dance pretty well  has really clear diction when rapping  in english and korean   and is super stupidly hot makes her the complete package in my eyes ,1,902,164
 queenslay      ,1,16,2
i don t know why you re getting downvoted  jennie does get a lot of hate  i don t even know why  some people say it s because of the  lazy  scandal  where she was very unenergetic and uenthusiastic in her performances  people started calling her a spoiled lazy brat etc  i think this narrative existed before though  what i mean is  even when they were rookies ish   people said jennie  looks like a bitch  and  seems mean  due to her resting bitch face  and there were baseless rumors about her being a bully or something  after that when it was announced that she will debut solo  everyone started talking about how she s  spolit  etc  so  i don t think the  lazy  scandal is what caused some people to see jennie in that light  because even before that  some people already had this negative image of her  based on literally nothing  and used that incident to further push that narrative  i think if it were any other member  the reaction would be different  i think there would of course be non hateful criticism  and yes antis will call them  untalented   but i imagine the reactions especially from so called blinks would have more concern  if it were rosie  jisoo or lisa  i e   is she eating well    i hope she s okay     that s just how i feel but i can t be 100  sure  the comments about jennie went from criticism to straight up mass cyber harrasment   stupid spoiled  ungrateful  untalented brat who doesn t care about her fans  etc   okay i literally went on a whole rant but i can t answer why some people hated her in the first place     i think it s just bandwagon hate  i was looking at some comments on youtube and people were saying  jennie is so jealous of lisa  it s so obvious she hates lisa look at her face  etc   she would literally playfully tease lisa  or look in her general direction without smiling i e her rbf face   and others would reply  omg yes  i totally see it she s such a fake bitch  i hate her         i think some of these people have a confirmation bias     seriously i feel bad for her but i m hoping those  blinks  are just a loud minority but it scared me when these comments get hundreds of likes  that paradise city cf is an example  lots of blonks were hating jennie for having more screen time calling her  selfish    anyway you should not feel bad at all for biasing jennie       she s amazing  i absolutely adore her  and with what you said towards the end  i think jennie herself said  i forgot where when  she feels like she s good at everything but not amazing at anything  but that s part of her charm  isn t it  and recently i m seeing so much jennie love on twitter about that pharrell chanel event thing  lt 3 uwu she looked so confident and enthusiastic on that stage  there were definitely people who kept hating on her saying she can t sing  she ruined the song  but what can you do  success attracts the haters  ,1,2874,505
by far the best keyboard i know of  pretty much my end game  but i ll stick with my anne pro 2 and eat normally for now  i don t want to eat instant noodles for the rest of my life lol ,1,185,40
please show the girls lots of love at coachella   i bet they re nervous since it s not their concert and there s gonna be a whole lot of different people,1,153,28
the links are super helpful  thank you   the epik high is indeed gorgeous  seeing iu in the video was a nice surprise  too  although the sound effects in the music video were distracting  i don t know if that s common or not  but it was odd to me  i like the day6 songs  too  i don t listen to a lot of indie rock but their songs were pretty  lovely vocals ,1,357,69
they look like perfection  i m hoping for a story mv this time  it would be so great to see some acting skills from the girls ,1,126,25
i used to draw a lot of portraits back when i was a highschooler but currently i m out of practice because of the nature of my profession  i m a classic example of  don t make your hobby your job   lol    i haven t done  traditional  leisure drawing in years but blackpink has recently sparked a bit of motivation inspiration within me  hence this drawing of lisa   ,1,366,65
30 here  never listened to kpop before  become a blink this year after hearing about their na tour   p,1,102,19
anyone else notice the different hair than individual teaser photos ,1,68,10
i m so excited  ,1,16,4
holy shit  i didn t think this was that  i can t take my eyes off of you   but omg it is  btw  the pet shop boys version of this song  mixed w u2 s where the streets have no name  is also worth a listen  i guess i m not that old     ,1,233,48
how long have you been drawing ,1,31,6
this^^^ tomb raider af    i want to see them kick some f ing ass ,1,65,13
i m shaking ,1,12,2
holy it is the exact same for me too xd,1,39,10
35 here and already fearing i m going to be the oldest person  by at least 10 years  in the arena when i see them ,1,114,24
first comeback too  i watched 4d for the first time about two months ago only lol  i am getting more and more anticipated to their music since then  but i before noticing bp i don t like kpop in general  bp brings me to kpop  it feels so unreal  hope they will do better and better in the future ,1,296,58
what the  jisoo s outfit is literally half and half amazing yg im not ready for this    ,1,88,17
i ve never said jesus  name so loud my mom thought i hurt myself lol,1,68,14
blackpink here we go ,1,21,4
this comment is so stupid ,1,26,5
i will go with 22 26 average age ,1,33,7
so gma promotion really got them new fans  ,1,43,8
it s really catchy ,1,19,3
yes it really does  this is my second and i m a frazzled mess everyday ,1,71,14
i literally joined in january  i heard of blackpink in december  but didn t really know them  i watched blackpink house a year late  i ve been keeping up with the news and socials  yes  yes  yes  i am pumped for my first comeback    d,1,234,44
holy gosshh  i am out of breathe  this comeback gonna kill us all  ,1,67,13
damn so you just found out about them really recently  d that s pretty amazing  shows that the us promotions already helped  them speaking english is so valuable and the music they make is easy to listen to for a western audience as well  while still having the kpop sound  have fun at coachella   also interesting to see that there are some  older  blinks here  i am 27 myself  ,1,379,68
ahh i didnt know there was a limit  but def knew this would get pushed down  ,1,77,16
unfortunately  we can only pin 2 posts at the same time and the spots are taken by the world tour masterthread and the weekly discussion thread  maybe pinning this on saturday or sunday  but i m going to post the survey again on wednesday ,1,239,43
honestly  if bigbang releases more music  without seungri  after they all get out of the military i would at least check it out  bigbang is pretty amazing and one of the very first kpop groups i heard  highly recommend  ,1,220,39
omg they re breaking out of the yg dungeon,1,42,8
excited for the results ,1,24,4
tomb raider vibes anyone ,1,25,4
curious  should this be stickied pinned  ,1,41,5
 gt  these girls just have that charm  oh yeah they surely do  no doubt about that  they feel more genuine and down to earth as well  which is a big plus ,1,154,31
i was sold as soon as the first teaser came out but this just solidified that this comeback will probably be my favorite  ,1,122,23
i think i was october for me  someone in the indieheads sub posted about asian groups and i ve been listening to blackpink  sobs  and haru nemuri ever since  ,1,158,28
33 here    i can t wait to see our girls perform at king s landing as the dead arrive  house black is taken so    house pink it is  ,1,132,26
i can t wait to see how many of my fellow 30 something year olds are out there   p,1,82,18
probably the next teaser will have pre order information ,1,57,8
jisoo slaying,1,13,2
i can t wait to see them at coachella weekend 1  as a 37 year old male  it s crazy how addicted i am to this group only after discovering them during good morning america haha  then watching all the videos  bp house  reaction vids etc  i am super excited for got and endgame tho haha  ,1,285,54
cant wait  3  lt 3,1,18,4
oh i m deep deep  and yea i ve never felt this emotionally connected to any artist before  despite watching those artist interviews and videos as well  these girls just have that charm ,1,185,31
then i should put my newly bought  square up  album inside to let them sign on it ,1,82,17
they ll slay us first  then raid our tombs afterwards,1,53,9
no we need a midnight vigil for all blinks  or maybe the whole world will be slain    ,1,86,17
congrats  you only had to wait 4 months for a comeback ,1,55,11
it s my 2nd comeback  i feel like i m more excited last year since there s not much going on with blackpink months before the actual comeback  but this year  we ve been blessed with so much stuff like the world tour  side events and guesting like channel  adidas  michuri  ect ,1,277,48
sksk screw my brothers birthday im ,1,35,6
it makes sense  before dddd i think this sub didn t even have 10k subscribers  now we are at 21k  so most people here probably got into bp during that time  d have fun and support the girls    d,1,194,39
at least you live in a population center unlike me in kansas lol ,1,65,13
we got shooters on deck,1,23,5
absolutely feel you there hehe  i am not sure how deep you are into the rabbit hole of bp  but it seems to be rather deep   but man watching so much of their content  be it vlives  blackpink house  blackpink diaries  interviews  etc really gave me an emotional connection to them  got is nice and all  notice my name  though it comes from the books rather than the show   but april is bp s month in my book  d,1,409,78
i am going to enter cryonic suspension like cartman did for the wii  someone dig me up from the snow next week ,1,111,22
gamers rise up ,1,15,3
how do i rsvp,1,13,4
on  there will be a male bias due to reddit s overall userbase being like 90  male  ,1,84,16
especially because there really needs to be some time for preorders as well  but oh well  i am also way too excited to wait  i am feeling like a little kid again  d,1,164,33
a little bit yeah  but i had chills when i first heard some of the song during their vlive  definitely trying to watch it this year as well ,1,140,28
hehe  nah no kid yet\^\^ ,1,25,5
lmao this just the teaser for the poster  can you guys imagine when the teaser for the video comes out  we re all going to be losing our minds ,1,143,28
i need this without text for my phone  ,1,39,8
i was just about to comment and say this is tomb raider chic lol this song is going to be intense for sure ,1,107,23
not really sure why we haven t got the tracklist yet  i m way to excited to wait until next week  i just need some solid information ,1,133,25
end of got  avengers end game     and what i care most about this month is kill this love  i totally feel you haha,1,114,23
i really am not ready omg im crying ,1,36,8
i read this as  really make me want a kid again   i was confused ,1,65,14
seems like there s quite a lot of us first timers for this comeback  only got into bp kpop around the end of last year after i randomly came across dx4 on youtube  can t believe how hyped i am for this  phew ,1,208,40
i thought i was ready for this comeback but i don t think i am  not sure i can handle what coming  this may be the death of me ,1,127,28
anyone know if a preorder for the ep is up anywhere  i wanna get the physical ,1,78,16
maybe few years later,1,21,4
where did blond jennie go  ,1,27,6
i think if blackpink wants to fill big stadiums they should study where metallica performed so perhaps centurylink field   keyarena  ,1,133,21
first comeback as well  i must confess i cannot believe i have reached a period in my life where a kpop girl group s music release is a contender for the most hyped event of this long awaited month of april and is  actually  beating out  wtf  end game and got in hype levels  if someone predicted this to me one year ago  i would ve slapped them for this absolutely heretical insult   and yet here i am   ,1,405,76
one thing i don t like about the vlive is they spoil the music video ,1,69,14
oh jesus  trying my best not to die before i get to see them at the end of the month  they re making it difficult  ,1,115,24
my birthday is april 9  just in time  lt 3 ,1,43,9
omg this style is crazy ,1,24,5
miss jisoo kim in them thigh highs,1,34,7
excuse me afew weeks ill be in the hospital,1,43,9
they really want me bald huh  ,1,30,6
everytime there s a poster or pictures of all of them my first reactions is to look at their feet and look at how thick is jennie s and jisoo s soles are or how high the heels they are wearing   then my brain can compute why they all are at similar height ,1,256,51
dreams do come true  i always thought lisa kinda looks like young angelina jolie  that midriff though  lara croft indeed ,1,121,20
now i will have 5 wombs to raid  oops  tombs  ,1,46,10
i want to see listen to the mv song so bad  concept looks fire ,1,63,12
the best part didn t even start yet though  there should be some music teasers  last year in the form of moving posters like this one    though last year these came really early  so maybe something different this time around  we will see  definitely try to catch the vlive they will most likely do 1 hour before the mv will be out though  that was such a great moment for me with my first bp comeback  d,1,403,76
ohhh ok,1,7,2
im ready to be murdered      ,1,29,6
[billboard article confirmation]  ,1,34,3
      mom i m scared  ,1,22,6
i m not ready,1,13,3
it s a spinner  still  all the teasers are great ,1,49,9
they re on another level  they own the girl crush concept and they make it better every single time    they re in for the kill with this comeback ,1,146,26
so we really not going to have a blonde jennie   ,1,49,11
looking forward to the data  i d assume that people on here are on average a little older than say on twitter  maybe around 18 20 ,1,130,24
the pharrell tracks are way better than the max martin tracks don t   me ,1,73,14
jisoo with  that look  like she s about to murder me    i m in   ,1,65,13
lara croft vibes up in this bitch,1,33,7
i cannot remember if there were any last year  but i see a lot of people posting that we shouldn t expect any so i guess there were none  d,1,139,29
imagine being this badass cuz i can t,1,37,7
i am blessed,1,12,3
since it s the weekend  i dont think any teasers will get posted so i m gonna be even more anxious waiting  ,1,108,20
agreed   they all look awesome  amp  the style is super cool  i looove jennie s hair here  her natural color is pretty and i love the style  it s hard to tell from the photo but it looks like some kind of braid updo  very pretty  ros  s braid look is pretty too ,1,262,50
holy hell i want ros  to top me like blackpink tops the charts,1,62,13
i guess we ll pray for more than 4 songs all through the weekend too ,1,69,14
i can t breathe      ,1,21,4
that greek esque statue head in the back of them reminds me of the greek esque pillars in aiiyl,1,95,17
omg the styling is incredible  definitely tomb raider vibes with the outfits  love the braids on rosy and not the least bit upset about jennie with her natural hair color  holy shit they look so good ,1,200,36
we will have a tribute for you at the service too,1,49,11
reminds me of pubg  looks like this comeback is dropping me straight to my grave ,1,81,15
 what a total serve wow  ,1,25,5
i can t make it since i ll be dead too ,1,39,9
i  am  speechless ,1,18,3
because when you are born  it s your first year  so you are 1  in the west they count how many years you have completed  ,1,121,24
slaying greek gods in the background and not a hair out of place,1,64,13
ahhh      when are the pre order links going to come   album details at least   i m so damn excited ,1,100,18
i was just thinking this when i first saw the picture before coming here  first it was like some kind of vampire theme now tomb raider   dont know where they re trying to take this but i m here for it ,1,201,39
same goes for china  the reason is in these countries you automatically start out as 1 year old when you re born  shit s extra confusing when the lunar new year passes and some asian folks count that as another year onto your age and you ll end up 2 years older than your actual age sometimes lol ,1,297,55
omfg i am deceased  they snapped,1,32,6
but i cannot wait that long  all these teasers really make me a kid again haha,1,78,16
ready to slay ,1,14,3
i m sure they will release that early next week  crosses fingers ,1,65,11
yaaasssssss i love it    ,1,25,4
wow  they look absolutely badass   so excited ,1,46,8
hmmm like woah ,1,15,3
they look like they re about to settle a hostage situation ,1,59,10
i can t wait  so excited ,1,25,5
i like it a lot  but i had hoped for ep information  yg pls  ,1,61,14
i m seriously so in love with these concepts  bad ass girl power  give me more plz ,1,83,16
we going full tomb raider up in this  where the fck do you go from here  i m excited as hell for the song  ,1,107,23
yes a lara croft concept lets get it girls,1,42,9
tomb raider ,1,12,2
my funeral will be on april 6th if anyone wants to attend after i get killed by this comeback,1,93,19
i m hyped for next week  this looks like a really cool concept ,1,63,12
i thought the rama m60 a was a tank  had to look it up  ,1,56,14
didn t downvote you but in the above pics she looks very much not happy lol ,1,76,15
a 2019 2019 no newbie here ,1,27,4
her international age is 22  korea uses some weird system  i think they want to get rid of it b c on official documents even they use international age ,1,152,28
can t wait for the results  should be interesting ,1,50,8
no  dont understand why everyones downvoting me lmao,1,52,8
i can see blackpink hitting the sf bay area market as well  ,1,60,12
you don t have to be a music producer to judge an album or music in general  ,1,77,16
if possible  it would be interesting to see how many blinks are male female  whether if they were kpop fans beforehand  etc ,1,124,21
aight go ahead and produce a better album then ,1,47,9
the results will be posted april 4,1,34,7
pls dont  we all witnessed the mess he did on sweetener ,1,56,11
yea in korea you are 1 when you are born  it is just one of those thing we don t question,1,89,20
wait what  that s a thing   amp  x200b ,1,39,6
a kpop prediction account said they will collab next year  ,1,59,11
that s her korean age   for example if you are 25  in korea you are 26  ,1,72,15
so long as fansites don t go leaking fake upcoming collabs again then i think he should be safe from the crazies ,1,113,21
does anyone have any info on soundcheck tickets  i don t know what time we have to be there and if it s super early like before noon i can t make it    thanks   ,1,161,33
 gt plus jennie s  solo  era has really made her more confident on her own which is what yhs wanted to accomplish with each of their solo debuts  i love this   i am so happy for her and how happy  amp  confident she looks performing  she killed both songs  and she looked like she really enjoyed it  too    that s all i want for all of them  to have fun  be themselves  amp  make great music ,1,392,74
ep has 4 songs so i hope a mini album will have 6 songs ,1,56,14
i m still going through everyone s recommendations  blinks are amazing    but i think nct might be my favorite so far   i like all of the nct songs you listed  i m definitely going to look up more of their songs  thank you   ,1,225,41
mini album with 6 songs   that d be a dream ,1,44,9
so it is a wig,1,14,5
 gt  rama m60 a nice,1,20,4
rose remains my fave of the group  but i kind of hate what she s wearing  i mean  what do i know  i know nothing about fashion or what have you  but that dress looks kind of like she was attacked by swarm of sentient pleather bags ,1,231,46
i was surprised myself  they aren t happy about the tanked being  blinged  out ,1,79,13
lets just hope the toxic twitter nets dont do a dj snake on him,1,63,14
right  that s a  look  right there ,1,35,6
of course he did    he is under her spell now ,1,46,10
i love her,1,10,3
wouldn t doubt it  but even the black label posted a pic of him  yang hyun suk himself just followed pharrell  zion t just posted a pic with him  and he was in the yg studios with jennie and lisa  who knows what s gonna happen  ,1,228,43
after kill this love mini album is released  blackpink might get up to 15 16 songs  and i think they can mix in cover songs to increase their play list to 20 ,1,158,31
i view this more as a fashion relationship type of thing rather than music so hopefully fans wont get too crazy,1,111,21
blonks stay away  let s not cause another dj snake incident please  ,1,68,11
i got chills during the intro of  can t take my eyes off you   plus her rap was so raw and charismatic  a lot of people think putting blackpink on tour with only 9 songs was too early for them  but i disagree  while it sucks to only perform with 9 songs  it feels like they ve gained so much confidence on stage in the sense that they re comfortable adlibbing and flowing with the music  they were already dope af when they strictly followed their routines and choreographies  but not as confident breaking out of them  this tour has helped them so much  plus jennie s  solo  era has really made her more confident on her own which is what yhs wanted to accomplish with each of their solo debuts  can t wait to see how the group turns out once they all get a solo under their belt  ,1,782,145
same  the eyes make them look white haha but other than that  well done,1,71,14
dang there really is a subreddit for everything   ,1,50,8
hey  if anyone is interested  i have 2 p2 tickets for sale for the concert in forth worth  i sadly  i can t go anymore  hate to let these tickets go to waste  dm  i can transfer the tickets through axs ,1,202,40
jieun left the team i don t know if maeng brought on anyone else to help her but yessss the makeup is amazing  ,1,111,22
ahhh my current two obsessions and the first two concerts i have planned this year   ,1,85,15
there might be a chance just from looking at this list of kpop concerts held in the us  you can see a number of groups and solo artists that have played seattle  [ ,1,164,33
they are fan sites  ,1,20,4
her makeup is everythingggggg she looks amazing like this,1,57,9
i just saw another video shading her  they are still some people posting about it on youtube,1,92,17
this particular aspect of kpop still unnerves me  it s a perfectly kind gesture  but the fact that fans are willing to spend tens of thousands on gifts for artists who don t even know them is a little creepy if i m to be honest ,1,228,43
omg she looks so beautiful   ,1,29,6
how come ,1,9,2
no chance in hell they re going to seattle  maybe sfo or vancouver,1,66,12
is that a romper or a dress  how does she sit  i m sure she is wearing shorts but wow it s super short  only jennie kim can pull this look off  ,1,144,30
and still doing the manner hands too,1,36,7
we don t know what s happening behind the scene but right now we can see that she s happy  also some over react with the lazy thing  the video was purposely and maliciously cut to bring jennie down       ,1,204,37
i m a big bangtan fan and was about to reccomend them lol since they re not your thing though  are you into indie rock  i d definitely recommend day6  you were beautiful is my favorite but they have an amazing roster  i loved you and i smile are great too   epik high just released thier new album and it s been hitting all the right spots with me  the title track drunk in love is just gorgeous   theyre not really a  boy group  but just in case you haven t heard thier new album i d definitely recommend it    got7 are also a favorite of mine   thier newest song is from a subunit jus2 called  focus on me [  i go back and forth on which is my favorite march release between this one and epik high  ,1,701,132
oh my    last time i stared at a pic this long was the first time i saw the rama m60 a  ,1,88,20
lol this again  ,1,16,3
she is the crazy one there  ,1,28,7
let s not judge a book by its cover  none of us know how long they practice daily and how much sleep they get  there have been idols who fainted on stage out of exhaustion  ,1,173,34
     you re about 4 5 months late ,1,34,6
oh  i guess jennie had a hectic schedule today then   ,1,54,11
get that      darling  ,1,23,4
please give all the love and support to the girls this comeback season  there s too much negativity already effecting them because of the yg scam  do not add on to it  ,1,168,31
she looks so cute  ,1,19,4
sarcasm   ,1,10,2
i think so  they re growing in america every day  maybe next year,1,65,12
i love both bts and nct 127  for nct i d recommend  regular    whiplash   and  no longer   there s also nct 2018 which is [super hype]   for bts some of my favorites are mic drop  steve aoki remix    trivia  just dance    ephiphany   and  euphoria   additionally i haven t gotten too far into either of their discographies but  shine  by pentagon and  clap  and  holiday  by seventeen are all really good ,1,405,67
but [this korea times article]   says   gt  goyang  gyeonggi province   kia motors unveiled the mohave masterpiece concept suv for the first time ever during the 2019 seoul motor show  thursday  offering a glimpse of the new car which will be rolled out in the domestic market in the second half of this year  so it should be today,1,331,59
if i had to guess    pharrell probably wrote a song  wanted to get some female vocals up on it  coincidentally bumped into jennie and lisa  went straight into the studio and started spitting some bars  will we ever see said song  probably not  ,1,244,43
i guess the kia event was yesterday  ,1,37,7
i ll never understand the lazy comments   every video i watch  she s putting on the performance of her life and smiling and having fun  i love her forever  ,1,156,27
if she did she d have no choice but to stan,1,43,10
how much do you actually know about bp s lifestyle  they aren t these sheltered little cherubs ,1,95,15
hell ariana might be bigger in korea than bp is    that s probably an exaggeration but i feel like so many female idols talk about loving ariana and cover her stuff ,1,165,30
there is nothing wrong with that  everyone s beautiful in their own way  ,1,73,12
[source 1]   [source 2]  ,1,25,4
why not  women wanna get laid too  pharrell is rich and handsome no ,1,68,13
lmao why,1,8,2
that would imply he s ever used it  which i highly doubt  ,1,58,11
this topic is long gone   ,1,26,5
that  damn   same bro  same   ,1,30,5
so today jennie was first attending a kia event with lisa  jisoo and rosie  then she attended the chanel event  and afterwards this event   so busy ,1,148,26

and you have a crusty dick  my friend,1,37,8
happy jennie is best jennie,1,27,5
rumor says the endorsement fee is  500000 ,1,42,7

i m so glad the blonde was fake her hair is too perfect,1,55,12

and she s not blonde like the teaser suggests,1,45,8

let pharrell produce blackpink s first full length album  interscope please make it so  ,1,88,13
omg she s so charismatic on the stage and she is singing i cant take my eyes off you too  ,1,90,19
only two of gidle were in pop stars  so it doesn t seem implausible to only have two members in the collab,1,106,20
she genuinely looks so happy performing  can t take my eyes off you   and her voiceeee   ,1,89,16

it s blacklabel studio  it means something  right  ,1,51,7

has anyone noticed that the background of their photos are being torn down one photo at a time  look at ros  s background  it s completely ruined  is it because ros  will have the next solo and she ll kill this love  [lisa s]   [jennie s]   [jisoo s]   [ros  s]   ahhh  subtle meanings  i cannot wait        this will be my first comeback ,1,339,56

selling la show tickets  3x p3 tickets  sec 208 row 14  for  145 each  ,1,71,14
 ros  is the revolution ,1,24,4
i honestly love this hair color on her and i think it s my favorite  variations of blonde just suit her facial features so well  it also literally goes with her name like ros  as in wine champagne  or rose as in flower  ,1,220,41
i wonder if she saw ros  s 7 rings cover bahahaha ,1,50,10
here s some more gifts from other lisa fansites  [1]f   [2]   [3]  ,1,67,11
happy birthday  ,1,16,2
i hoped that her hair would be black  but actually her hair is still blonde  but lighter,1,88,17
been waiting for ros  to have a fierce look like this  ,1,55,11
i use ais  now it s even better  5555,1,37,8
i wish i can be krunk even just for this comeback   ,1,52,12
nah uh  that s not luca anymore  that s already me  lmao,1,56,9
there s an ariana x blackpink mashup on yt maybe you d like that it sounds really good,1,86,16
i just checked lisa s gifts and ros  s from last month and man the chinese fans really spend thousands of dollars for these gifts  kinda crazy  d but not only that  they also really put a lot of thought into the gifts  pretty amazing ,1,234,43
my two worlds colliding ,1,24,4
i saw someone saying that jennie would perform with pharrell for the chanel event  it does make sense  would be lit tho  i m here for it  ,1,138,26
jisoo s extensions bothering me for some reason    her with short hair would be awesome,1,87,14
[even down to the pinstripe blazer from whistle]  ,1,50,8
i am relatively new to blackpink  but they are my favorite k pop group of all time  i have to admit i feel pretty bad for jennie being my bias  because of how much hate she seems to get  and i have to be honest i don t understand korean culture that well  does she get hate because she does something wrong  or is just the label pushing her to the point where people are sick of her  i just don t understand where all the hate comes from  i just think she and lisa are the bad girls of the group and i find lisa s voice to have a  female rapper sound  similar to nicki minaj  that i just don t like the sound of as much  i don t think jennie is the most talented dancer  singer  or rapper of the group  but i like her voice the most  i like her attitude  and i think she is the prettiest  i guess my question is should i feel bad about liking jennie ,1,850,169
if rv has nothing planned then i could see them in la for the weekend at least  ,1,80,17
jennie and rosie are the biggest scammers  we can only trust lisa and jisoo from now on lol   ,1,94,19
i m just appalled ariana be so casually conversing with fans like this  respect ,1,80,13
bro ima keep it 100 ariana is easily bigger than bp matter of fact she s the number 1 pop artist on the planet at this moment,1,125,26
lisa finally booked in thailand it s what she deserves  ,1,56,8
can i be the cat  thanksd,1,25,6
she deserves all the love uwu   ,1,32,6
oooooo they may be hanging out or making a song  they look like they re in a studio ,1,84,17
an ariana x blackpink collab will fill my blink and arianator heart tbh,1,71,13
as a new blink and kpop fan   i thought the ros bar gift list last month was already amazing  but this looks like another level ,1,128,23
actually both of their lifestyles involving being popular and talented  so      ,1,80,11
will red velvet be in la ,1,25,6
noted   thank you for letting me know   ,1,40,8
tbh pharrell s sound is too experimental out there to match well with bp  ,1,74,12
yes  high res  ,1,15,3

alright  thanks  press photos are allowed  ,1,43,6

you can see the gifts  macbook air 2019  leica q2 and more  on [lisabar s twitter ]   they also gave gifts to her family and yg staff ,1,134,25
oh wow  i was not ready for this  she s dripping with sex appeal  while exuding so much power and dominance  ros  is in control and gives zero fucks who knows it  i am here for this ,1,182,36
lisabar always does the most  ,1,30,6
flair change was required  goodbye chipmunk chaeng  anneyong madame leathers    ,1,80,10
jungkook is shook,1,17,3

i didn t think this could be possible but my bias just bias wrecked me ,1,71,14
i want to see yeri meeting her idol ari at coachella  i hope bp will gift all the red velvet with free tickets to the event  ,1,125,26
i would prefer ariana stay away from blackpink  they have different lifestyles and wouldn t want it rubbing off on bp ,1,118,20
do you know ariana  she s very friendly to her fans  here s a [screen recording]   for proof ,1,93,16
someone better hold me back  lt 3 ,1,34,6
lisa throwing it all the way back to debut time with her hair,1,61,13
yeah  i ve heard they re great  but i have been mostly focusing on newer currently active groups  i wasn t sure if they were still active since they haven t released anything since 2016  and k pop groups don t seem to have larger gaps like many western acts do  but now with the scandal    yeah  that makes me much less interested in looking into their discography   ,1,367,62
her pink is already washed out  ,1,32,7
that stare tho  holy shit ,1,26,5
i ve just been scammed     blinks are easy to fool    kim jisoo ,1,64,13
i feel like this is edited  a celebrity wouldn t answer dms from fans,1,69,13
  account is still up quit with your bs  there s even a recording in the comments for proof ,1,92,18
this hair was the melon music awards killer,1,43,8
fake or not  [video proof here and the account isn t shut down   ]   ,1,69,12
[source ]   ,1,12,2
after bp  i discovered big bang  although i heard fantastic baby a long time ago  and they are soo good  even better live  kinda sucks i missed that era and now with the seungri scandal  yeah  ,1,193,36
ros  s hair  i m confused ,1,26,4
jisoo s hair   rosie is still blonde    ,1,40,7
a random twitter account that is now shut down  yea this is fake ,1,65,13
you said you re killing this love but you are killing us with this photo       aaaahh ros      my bias wrecker   ,1,113,21
square up teaser sequence  ros   gt  jisoo  gt  jennie  gt  lisa kill this love teaser sequence  lisa  gt  jennie  gt  jisoo  gt  ros  can t wait for the comeback         ,1,171,29
thank you  i ll have to check those out  at least i m not alone  it seems from these replies that more people than i expected prefer the girl groups ,1,149,28
did not expect this badass look  she looks amazing  ,1,52,9
dunno bout you guys  but this is the coolest pic out of the 4  no wonder they saved it for last ,1,96,21
i tried winner and loved the  island   love me  ep  which is why i wanted to listen to them in the first place  after hearing those songs on blackpink house lol   but didn t care for much else  i should try more ikon  i only know a couple of their hits  i don t know anything about ateez  i ll definitely have to check them out  especially if it s only a couple eps so far  it s easy to break into a newer group  thank you  \ gt  bts is an obvious choice i like some songs  not really sure what s so special about them but to each their own  yeah  i m not feeling the magic that draws everyone else in  either  i ve listened to a lot of bts but i think they re just not for me  they re clearly talented  and i m glad they re so successful  that s great for them and great for k pop  period  but they re not my cup of tea ,1,821,156
i think the information re  ep comes a day or two before the actual comeback  but the preorders will probably open soon  and yes  you re right  the music teasers soon wowowowow i cant wait   i m so hyped  ,1,205,37
cmon dude she doesn t need clout  she s the biggest popstar in the world right now ,1,83,15
the stylinggggggggg         i m deadddddddd,1,43,4
i would ve liked to know the bpm ,1,33,7
chipmunk definitely looks ready to kill    she just killed me with this look    ,1,80,14
seriously  ariana s popularity eclipses blackpink s right now ,1,62,7
i am expecting some more information on the ep  how many songs  preorders opening  etc  and then probably some music teasers  like with the moving posters we had for dddd and forever young ,1,189,33
this outfit  my gay ass wasn t ready,1,36,7
ros   more like roslay ,1,23,4
i know what you mean  but ariana grande doesn t need the clout tho  she s literally the biggest thing in the west and if not  the world rn  ,1,140,27
most probably a group photo  can t wait to see the others members  outfits  wow  i am  sooooo  on board with this cb  a totally different vibe  ,1,144,26
no shade but i hope these american artists don t start using blackpink for clout,1,80,14
according to  it is a soviet t 34 ,1,34,7
she will wear this in the mv right  probably    definitely ros  here  that is right i am also so curious what tomorrow s teaser will be ,1,136,26
is this blade s sidekick about to go kick some vampire ass   ,1,61,12
yeah it looks like the order of neatest to most destroyed is  lisa  gt  jisoo  gt  jennie  gt  rosie   ,1,103,20
glows  hakdjdbmans,1,18,2
looking back  jennie s teaser had the destroyed backdrop too  maybe it s another cube we re unwrapping ,1,103,15
imagine seeing this full leather outfit on the m v  we can t even call her rosie anymore she s full on ros   the untouchable  ,1,126,23
really like how ros  s hair color ended being quite neutral and soft rather than black  really balances out the teasers when you put the four of the girls together  black would ve been too contrasting imo  and i believe this is the first time she s been given a diff hairstyle in their teasers  i love her hair here  ,1,317,57
i agree it s the perfect color  the blend of all of them is done well  dark from jisoo light from jennie dark light from rose light dark from lisa it s so good,1,159,32
is this a vampire concept because i m totally in,1,48,9
murdered me and certified dead    shall relive when the mv teaser drops ,1,72,12
thumbnail was enough to kill me  was not prepared to see the full image ,1,72,14
i wasn t expecting rose  matrix edition ,1,40,6
girl is slaaaaaayin,1,19,3
really like how ros  s hair color ended being quite neutral and soft rather than black  really balances out these teasers  black would ve been too contrasting imo  ,1,164,26
i came here to comment on her killer outfit and you summed it up more perfectly than i ever could,1,97,20
yeah this full leather outfit definitely shouts  kill this love   d ,1,68,11
omg i wasn t expecting blacks  but i wasn t expecting this either  her outfit    goodbye rosie  hello ros   and her teaser is the only one with a destroyed backdrop  wonder if that means anything lol  ,1,201,35
feel this kind of  suggestions  a little bit rude,1,49,9
we didn t get blacks  but we got pinks  clad in all black i m totally in love   ros  going full on dominatrix lol ,1,114,23
eternal bias has blessed us again  forever chaeyoung,1,52,8
my jaw has disappeared  my good goddd  i wouldn t be mad if she broke into my house and murdered me ,1,100,20
she s too beautiful  i almost cried  and completely deceased   ,1,63,9
she looks pissed and ready to whip us  what a queen,1,51,11
wow   rosie with the whole vampire  bdsm look i m totally in ,1,61,11
bias wrecker  holy shit  slayed by ros  ,1,40,7
this outfit just threatened to kidnap my whole family,1,53,9
ros   my dom vampire slayer goddes  ,1,36,6
not blacks  but i am totally fine with this as well  ros  jesus  always nice to see her having an other hairstyle than the typical open hair ,1,141,27
i am crying  and then deceased  ,1,32,6
the styling for this comeback is just amazing ,1,46,8
awesome  can i get krunk on my birthday  please  ,1,49,9
not gonna  lie  i m kinda  glad the blonde is a wig  jennie suits darker hair much more and she knows it  and works it verrry well   always nice to see her try new things though  also  pharrell   they re in a studio  i wonder if they were allowed to stray from teddy for once and got pharrell to work on one of the new tracks ,1,326,64
baseed on previous events  anyone know if there will be any merch  either online before the concert or at venue ,1,112,20
i guess someone wears a wig in every teaser image  i remember when everyone lost their minds to jisoo s pink  short hair back in d4   wish the blonde hair was real though    ,1,174,33
i totally feel you  i just prefer listening to the girl groups singing  my favorite boy groups are nct 127 u and monsta x  they have the kind of heavy hitting style i prefer ,1,174,33
am i just ootl  where did the kitty come from ,1,46,10
i really wanted blonde jennie   ,1,32,6
dead  im seeing then in may and this is making me nervous ,1,58,12
i m the same  i prefer girl groups  i assume you ve tried the yg boy groups  winner  ikon and bigbang  they ve kinda got the same flavour  i like all 3  ateez are probably my favourite at the moment  they haven t been around that long and only have to ep but i like most of their music so far  bts is an obvious choice i like some songs  not really sure what s so special about them but to each their own  the other bighit group txt seem to be off to a good start ,1,464,92
he s a great producer  so i wouldn t mind him producing something for them ,1,75,13
notice that guitar too  but don t know it s their studio  cool ,1,63,11
im not really keen on the idea of a collab between an american artist and bp  but i think a collab with pharrell williams would be a good one ,1,142,29
yes that one  ah i see,1,22,6
first time seeing blackpink s studio  i see the poster and ros  s guitar  didn t even know they had their own studio  well done girls,1,133,23
i literally had the same thought  that shit would be dope ,1,58,11
blackpink on some neptune nerd beats would be fire too  ,1,56,9
i know this is in relation to the the chanel event but i wonder if there is any likelihood of a collab  i ve been wondering why we didn t get the tracklist for the ep first before the member teasers maybe this is why  maybe they weren t sure if they could get the track finalised or maybe i m talking shit  who knows   honestly i don t really believe it  it s just fun to speculate  i m not really into the idea tbh  if it was old pharrell i d be all about it  i just think his newer stuff is a bit bland  n e r d x blackpink though that would be fire ,1,552,108
i ve been scouring this image for hidden meanings or spoilers for their upcoming comeback  all i found was that i was hungry and wanted whatever she s eating ,1,158,27
yup  and some projection too ,1,29,5
i love how rose and lisa s photos of themselves always involve low key trolling  so much luv  lt 3,1,98,17
colgate should definitely sponsor her,1,37,5
in some mv s they use hd led screen rather than green screens  ,1,63,12
awwwww man i was really for blonde jennie down to the scalp haha,1,64,13
thank you  i ve heard of them but have never listened to them  i will check out those songs ,1,92,18
i m the same way where girl groups interest me so much more than boy groups  pretty much the only active boy group i follow is seventeen  their songs including b sides are always good and their choreo is my favorite among boy groups  don t wanna cry  adore u  mansae  very nice  and oh my are my favorite title tracks by them ,1,326,61
of course it was a wig  the hair was dry as hell and you couldn t see a hairline ,1,81,18
the walls are most likely pink  you can see a bit of it in the making of video  if i had to guess  they are most likely renting sound stage location  ,1,150,30
oh no  my heart ,1,16,4
i think this account is pharrell s manager ,1,43,7
i honestly don t mind that it s just a wig  i mean going from how dark she is to blonde blonde in a short amount of time is super damaging to your hair ,1,152,32
the truck is very much real  if fact you can see it in the making of video  i believe most of their mv are like 90  real props background  the only exception to this is whistle  also when you consider the amount of time between shooting and release of mv  there isn t much time for heavy vfx  everything done in camera is much faster ,1,334,63
aaah  so jennifer played safe  it s a wig in the mv ,1,52,11
the image was uploaded an hour ago  on a instastory here   ,1,59,11
so it was a wig    i should have known that jennie would never bleach her hair like that ,1,89,18
ugh the hair  the biggest mystery is this photo recent or before mv shooting,1,76,14
they seems to be in one of the yg studio omg,1,44,11
beautiful depiction of lisa        you did a fine job ,1,54,10
the ice cream truck is very feasible  doesn t take much to rent a prop truck and then print your design on it  keep in mind the print isn t permanent  it s most likely washed off or overlaid blank for the next person to rent and use   the bedazzled tank is the one that makes me go hmmm ,1,287,56
this isn t specifically blackpink  but i listen to a lot of girl groups in k pop and i ve been wanting to find a boy band but i can t seem to find one that i love as much as any of the girls   amp  x200b  does anyone have a recommendation  i figured if i ask fellow blinks  we might have similar taste so it might be a good fit    ,1,331,67
lmao don t tell me he confused that pic of jennie for lisa because of the hair change  ,1,87,17
i was going to guess chicken,1,28,6
hi  i majored in film in college   not that i know anything really  but i ve had a tiny bit of experience for school projects   it s probably an icecream truck  and they printed out art and stuck it on  like others have said  my question is in the underground railroad scene  did they paint the walls pink  or did they do that in post  because we know that in solo  the washing machines were originally green  then turned to blue  so  yes  they have the money  and their production design team is boooosss  question  do they have studios  a lot of things are on location  but does anyone know if there s a giant yg filming lot  or do kpop companies have to share  and is it different if you re not one of the big 3  or do they go to a motion pictures studio  ,1,759,143
i legit replayed her surprise laugh 20  times ,1,46,7
you right  was still groggy before so my reading comprehension suffered ,1,72,11
lowkey feel like she s gonna come for us with a jet black bob and fringe bangs  but she s pulled off every hair color and style so far so anything will look amazing on her  wouldn t be surprised if she just sticks with the sandy blonde she s had recently either,1,261,49
can t wait they put this content in the  blackpink diaries  episode of taipei   ,1,80,13
according to teddy park  the girls do have some input on ideas  but i assume it s very little involvement ,1,106,19
i m talking about moms of russian child models  like kristina pimenova  i wouldn t be talking about ella s mom because then my sentence before this one directly contradicts itself ,1,180,28
taiwanese chinese street food  it s a sweet dessert coated with melted sugar,1,76,11
 hi  anyone still looking for tickets for la show  selling p1 tickets section 108 row 06  have 3 tix seat 1 2 3  these are platinum seats  looking for 400 obo please message me if interested  discount if take all 3 ,1,215,39
i love sprinkles even more now,1,30,6
no  based on the background  this image should be taken in taipei when before they were having concert there  and she was standing in a night market  as night markets are everywhere in taiwan especially in taipei  also from the stall shown in the image  the candy is actually called bingtanghulu        meaning  rocksugar candied bottle gourd   or sometimes simply tanghulu        candied bottle gourd    a traditional chinese snack of candied crataegus pinnatifida  also known as mountain hawthorn  chinese haw  chinese hawthorn or chinese hawberry  it is also called shanzha       which is a chinese fruit  the  bottle gourd  in its name refers to the slight resemblance of the snack to the shape of the gourd fruit  this candy is a common snack in the northern part of china  like in beijing  and rarely found in the south  but some taiwan night markets still have them  it consists of fruits covered in hard candy on bambooskewers that are approximately 20 cm long  recently  the haw could be replaced by various other fruits  like strawberries  blueberries  bananas  kiwifruits  pineapples  cherry tomatoes  etc  the pits and seeds of the hawthorn are emptied out and are commonly filled with sweet red bean paste before being skewered and dipped  source  own knowledge and english wikipedia lol,1,1300,212
 gt from my observations  russian moms tend to be the most exploitative with  promoting  their daughters  careers  wasn t sure if you were referring to ella s mom or saying this in general  but ella s mom is korean  it s her father who s white hence her name ella gross ,1,270,45
nope  traditional chinese candy  the background of the photo is a taiwanese street market ,1,90,14
[it s a traditional chinese candy]  ,1,36,5
 gt  i think this is the one she s using    that s the old one she used along with some of the other blackpink members when taeyang held his concerts [ some other people linked the one she s currently using in that twitter thread ]   ,1,234,41
her instagram always makes my day,1,33,6
cant believe i still see this type of bs on a kpop subreddit yeesh,1,66,14
of course  and apart from that  i also hope that they could someday make some influence to the society and even the world too  and breaking more records other than social media,1,176,32
pretty sure it s that japanese dango candy  ,1,44,7
would also like to know this  it looks delicious  ,1,50,10
what are those red things she s holding  is it some sort of candy ,1,66,13
if we get more records  she might also might hold the record of  most social media records broken by one idol ,1,110,21
 gorgeous  is an understatement,1,31,4
why do i think it s jennie this time  i mean  krunk looks smaller than usual and seems to move and act like her ,1,112,23
what if they re keeping ros  last because she has fucking short hair or some crazy shit that d be wild,1,102,19
even the members wore the krunk costume  so i guess it rotates  but my best bet is that it s a female staff ,1,108,22
lisa in jeans and heels  i think my heart may have stopped  i can t even comprehend this level of beauty ,1,105,20
it s pretty much the same  yes ,1,31,6
kpop is a 5 billion dollar industry ,1,36,7
im not sure about korean age but in china everyone gets  1 on new years day and when you are born you are already 1 year old  which means that if you are born on 31 december  western   you will already be 2 years old on 1 january while you are only 2 days old  so it might work the same in korea ,1,296,63
  caption    thank u for wishing me a happy birthday [  source  ]  ,1,67,10
you are a saint,1,15,4

drew this almost a month ago  actually one of my favourite candids of lisa  ,1,76,15
i m dying   rosie reposting this 3 times  the latest is the best  the blurred out iphones lmaooooooo  too bad they didn t get an apple deal  now they have to hide their phones  and true allegiance  all the time   ,1,213,40
yg spares no expense for bp music videos  it s one of the few things he does right  ,1,84,17
i say this with love  jisoo has not always topped my bias list for bp  but she is wrecking me with this hair ooommmg    ,1,120,24
lifeless haters   they do not even have a valid reason to hate   just creating clickbait titles   i see no problem with jennie here   the uploader is just focusing on specific targeted clips where jennie slows down or rests   which any human would do in a half hour long live concert,1,283,55
i see this comment all the time  but maybe they simply don t have the skillset to compose music  it s really fucking hard to do that  especially because it needs to be really good as well  i honestly think that yg has the highest standard for anything bp releases which is why teddy and teddy alone made music so far  i really don t think that yg treats them any differently  the most likely option is that they didn t write anything yet and imo that is totally fine as well ,1,475,88
i think it will be 6 songs  ,1,28,7
ahhhhh so she has layers  not short hair  i like the greyish color on her  also  this is just super cute ,1,105,21
till date i still do not know is krunk   is it one person  a rotation of different people  other yg artist  teddy himself  a yg trainee  ,1,137,27
im pretty sure it is,1,20,5
you can certainly look at one album produced by just about anyone and say it was not good  i m looking at the track record  pharrell produced a number of hits going back 20 years  britney spears  jt  nsync  jay z  beyonce  miley cyrus  etc  i suppose it s possible that he peaked in 2013 with  get lucky    happy   and  blurred lines  and been downhill since  [others]  ,1,370,64
i like to think that s jisoo inside of krunk again ,1,51,10
no one is surprised  that s our lisa  ,1,38,7
the  taste like p ssy  is fan edited lol  yge has the budget for it  they always go all out in mvs,1,98,21
i think there will never be lisa s and jisoo s solo  just their luck  i really hope i m wrong though  ,1,102,19
they have the budget for it  forget the ice cream van   remember the blinged out tank ,1,86,15
then i ll never be ready for work or make it in time especially during this comeback teaser period  ,1,100,19
don t be so gullible  not everything you see online is true  besides why would they even put something like that on the truck especially if they know that it s going to get viewed by millions  ,1,193,35
nope  definitely not sarcastic  those stats were super insightful,1,65,9
i don t know what answer to you except to get  none of us knows if or when any of the other solo project are happening  there are many things going on with yg atm with the whole scandal  as well as with blackpink themselfs with a comeback right around the corner  coachella and the world tour  so many things can happen in these few months  as for the future we can t tell anything  we need to have patience and enjoy blackpink and what they give us now and only time will tell what will happen after  i don t see a point of this thread tbh with you  simply because there is at least one such this every day and i am sure that if we get any new information it will be posted  ,1,676,133
also i remember reading online forgot where that the actual number on the truck was to a sex phone line ,1,104,20
yeah they have the money for it but idk if they actually painted it on maybe stickers or smth i don t really know,1,113,23
its been predicted on twitter that they will get 50 60m views in 24 hours,1,73,14
luca after a long time  i thought she forgot about him  ,1,56,11
oops thanks for correcting me  all this time i thought he did,1,61,12
she is on fire       ,1,21,4
fuck solo stans,1,15,3
gorgeous babe  and the heels    birthday girl is shining   ,1,59,10
her name is lisa  long legged lisa  ,1,36,8
he also promised us 2ne1 solos and a cl album in 2014  none happened ,1,69,14
well  honestly i don t see why not  he had to announce a solo project for every member either way  simply because people will accuse him for ignoring the rest of the group  funny enough  even tho he did say all memebers will get solo  people accuse him  instead of just having a little patience  but honestly  i personally don t really care  simply because i love the group as a whole and just because of one member  but dont get me wrong  i would still love for all of them to get a solo  ,1,490,93
he didn t product the entire album  ntltc is max martin and ilya ,1,65,12
do you honestly truly believe the other solos were planned when he announced jennie s ,1,86,14
how am i what s wrong with the community  everyone on here calls yg on his lies and bullshit  ,1,94,18
i think lisa s solo was supposed to be last  so i can t see it coming before next year s summer unfortunately  we will hopefully see rose s solo this fall  and now the halsey cover was not her solo  it was just a gift from rose herself towards us   blinks  as a gratiture for her b day wishes and support  there will be solos and please stop saying they care only for jennie  they said that yg was planning on releasing a solo for each member pretty much from the start of blackpink  ,1,484,91
you re what is wrong with the blink community  hopefully mod closes this soon as possible  what a waste of a post ,1,114,21
well i need a lisa solo asap,1,28,7
for me  i didn t immediately see it as damage control  i just thought it was the typical yg promising too much but ultimately disappointing us,1,142,25
have a lot of blinks come to believe that the other three solos announcement were damage control  ,1,98,17
i just assume it s cause she so gorgeous she may as well be miss korea all years ,1,81,17
please don t put that awful thought into the universe   the halsey cover and yes  blackpink has a lot of fans who focus specifically on one member   i m pretty sure he put that out there to avoid being set on fire by lisa fans,1,226,43
do you think the other solo announcements were damage control  and i think rose s solo was that awful halsey song,1,113,20
legs eleven  ,1,13,3
i have my doubts myself about the other solos coming at all but i really do think that at least a ros  solo debut is coming  lisa and jisoo is definitely up in the air though,1,174,36
but why announce the other three solos if they weren t ready  like i said the other solo announcements are damage control  yg only cares about jennie  this whole group was a vehicle for her  ,1,191,34
sis we re kinda getting a group comeback right now  support it and ask after the goodbye stage at least,1,103,19
i couldn t tell if you were being sarcastic or not  but that was an amazing article  the graph geek in me was loving it ,1,120,24
since when did i became love and visuals a weapon  ,1,51,10
right  she really does  those caught my eyes the moment she entered the room ,1,77,14
your comment makes it as if they are period not doing anymore vlives it s only been 1 2months  it s most likely temporary they ll be back to it once tour and comeback is finished most likely ,1,191,34
she looks so good in those heels wow,1,36,8
maybe  but it s not even a downgrade  the s10 is way better  ,1,61,13
maybe they have to do that when they re out in public events for promotional purposes  but still keep their iphones for private use ,1,132,23
looks like she ditched the iphone for the samsung galaxy s10 ,1,61,11
full article here  but in korean    don t know how numbers translate from kr to en  but apparently that particular one jennie is using is selling around   6 million units   per month which dwarfs their other products  source    i think this is the one she s using    it s for sure the daisy one tho  ,1,300,52
i think she is wearing extensions here maybe because probably she came from an event ,1,85,15
lisa s hair   is long   what is this sorcery      is she wearing extensions   ,1,78,13
full article here  but in korean    don t know how numbers translate from kr to en  but apparently that particular one jennie is using is selling around 6 million units per month which dwarfs their other products  source    i think this is the one she s using    it s for sure the daisy one tho  ,1,296,52
she looks great with that red brown ish hair color  i m still hoping that purple haired jisoo will make a return someday,1,120,20
i miss their livestream too even a couple of minutes will be fine   the tour plus the comeback might be really overwhelming for them ,1,133,23
oh yes i remember i watched a news talking about this before  thanks ,1,69,13
to be honest  they don t  especially now that they re so busy  they used to do vlives a lot   but they don t anymore  ,1,118,22
well  her korean age is 23 y o  korean age is different to   our age  korean age is usually  1 or  2 to their age  that we non koreans know   ,1,142,28
did they update ch  frequently  just think about to subscribe it  they seems being too busy to do some livestreams on free channel recently ,1,140,24
i thought today is her 22nd birthday  ,1,38,7
i see  i thought it is something very secretive haha,1,52,10
they usually update their ch   on their birthdays  and write a thank you message to blinks  ,1,92,16
[lisa s handwritten birthday message to blinks in kor  eng  and thai]   ,1,72,11
wow a ch  update ,1,17,4
i just deeply in love with her cute funny soul ,1,47,9
lmfaaaoo she reposted with the iphone logos blurred out       she s so funny i can t wait her lmfao ,1,100,18
she so gorgeous she can make angels jealous ,1,44,8
translation  buy me meat for your birthday  ,1,44,7
and lisa quickly commented  again   ,1,36,5
haha just wondering why did she repost,1,38,7
lmfaooo she deleted the birthday wishes bcos lisa s iphone was showing and they re samsung endorsers  so funny,1,110,17
 successful  is meh but  no tears left to cry  is good  ,1,56,11
complete opposite of lisa being the member who posts with no or least captions ,1,79,14
rosie and her long ass captions  she s so cute   chaelisa truly the bestest of friends  sisters  ,1,97,17
so cute  ,1,9,2
yes     by the way the last part of your comment makes me think of a movie called death becomes her  ,1,101,20
too many american girls start wearing way too much makeup from a very early age  not helping matters is that many of their personal idols on social media  older teenage girls mostly  promote that look  it looks very synthetic and waxy to me  under direct sunlight it looks like they re slightly melting ,1,303,52
i d watch a drama with a vampire jisoo that looks like that ,1,60,12
jic you didn t know he produced the entire album not just that one track haha  go listen to successful or no tears left to cry ,1,127,25
it will really surprise me if there are actually so many songs in this ep album ,1,80,16
always rockin  that permanent eye shadow ,1,41,6
luca is such a visual ,1,22,5
wow  didnt believe bp outscored bts on youtube views  i double checked it and it s true  dddd   724m right now  dna 676m  ,1,122,23
everyone ive shown blackpink to have like them so i think theyll reavt well  also they were already very popular on that michael stayhan morning show,1,149,26
source  [  caption  happy birthday to this beautiful soul   i love you poopoo [ lalalalisa\_m]  ,1,96,15
true  especially since lisa s poster was literally the pic before   ,1,68,11
wow even [bbc radio 1]   sent a birthday wish to lisa  international queen ,1,75,13
aah  yeah  must be  jennie and blonde was too good to be true ,1,62,13
i just h ad a listen  sounds awful  western producers are so overrated  at least the ones fans keep on attaching to bp ,1,119,23
if we re basing on the teaser photos  it was a wig  pretty obvious how thickly the hairs were bunched along the middle parting,1,126,23
life support been installed to me this morning,1,46,8
personally i think ella has too much makeups     but maybe it s because she is a model  it feels strange to me for models at such a young age,1,141,28
yeah  they re hardly alone when it comes to associating with more famous people  it seems to be the instagram business model i guess  not throwing hate  but just had to get it off my chest and see how much of the board knew about it too  i m a pretty cynical girl so when i kept noticing ella always getting top comments  i follow all 5 bp accounts  i was like  okay  but this is strictly business why she s posting so much  it wasn t  ahhhhh ella and her unnniiiiieeees  \ adorable\  like how other people saw it  i knew nothing of this girl until bp  but i guess she s an american who s also friends with kristina pimenova  i don t think she ll ever go into kpop and people who hope she ll become a trainee are just projecting their wishes on her  more likely  given her genetic makeup  biracial eurasian who looks 90  korean with subtle western features in just the right places  she ll be well accepted in the korean cosmetics beauty industry  because of many koreans  fawning over that look  which might be more of her mother s long term goal  her mom is pretty restrained though when you compare her to some others  from my observations  russian moms tend to be the most exploitative with  promoting  their daughters  careers ,1,1232,215
isn t that a little bit weird to wish someone s birthday on a photo of the other one   ,1,87,18
hahaha  exactly  we will get to know tomorrow if it s a wig or real ,1,68,14
not unless she s wearing that wig ,1,34,6
we can only hope,1,16,4
yes please ,1,11,2
wow  the way her hair flows over her shoulders like a river of fire  looks sooo hot ,1,84,17
it seemed that 99  of the replies to his comment were positive or thanking him for supporting lisa  so hopefully thats a good sign ,1,131,24
oh no  please no dumb drama again ,1,34,7
after hearing what he did on sweetener honestly keep it,1,55,10
i wonder if jennie ever gave her that big slap in the face present ,1,67,14
for a group that has yet to seriously enter the western market and already getting arena concerts and also being hailed as the top girl group in the world i d say it s a good start for a barely 3 year old group  they haven t even reached their ceiling yet  the only direction is up ,1,282,54
i still hope they could have music of their own or at least partly of their own,1,79,17
so we get to see blonde jennie in public for the first time ,1,60,13
she looks so good   ,1,20,5
my jisoo my queeeeen       ok what colour is this    orange  ,1,61,12
wow i wonder if this is for real  ,1,34,8
oh my god they all look so beautiful    ,1,40,9
so we re definitely all about to die yeh ,1,41,8
when i read about pharrel s chanel collaboration happening i was wondering of jennie was gonna be involved some way so this is great news to me ,1,144,26
 gt  i don t wanna set myself up for disappointment i believe this comeback will break records  the fanbase has grown exponentially since square up  if you compare the first teaser of the square up era to lisa s poster it beat the likes retweets in just under 1 hour   gt  though i am optimistic that the next wait won t be 9 months again i think things will be different going forward  this western expansion in combination with interscope lit a fire under ygent s ass ,1,470,82
  yge shares official song description for blackpink s kill this love   blackpink s upcoming song kill this love is produced by teddy park  blackpink is once again collaborating with teddy  yg s hit maker who has worked on all the blackpink s songs since their debut  all blackpinks songs produced by teddy were chart toppers with longevity  teddy  who knows the advantages  charm and potential of black pink  this time too will be responsible to draw out the best music and concept for black pink  kill this love revolves around lead reed brass and drums which comes together with blackpink s overflowing charismatic rapping and vocals  are you excited for blackpink s comeback   balloonwanted          i am a bot that transcribes allkpop articles  ,1,750,116

do producers  dancers look hot in yg ,1,37,7
yg said arouns 6 8 songs  hopefully 7   kiss and make up solo version as bonus track,1,84,17
jennie is probably the busiest idol in kpop right now ,1,54,10
totally agree  while i know youtube views doesn t mean eveything in determining success  i like to think of the first 24 hr view count as a friendly competition for some lighthearted bragging rights  unfortunately  too many people take it too seriously ,1,253,41
oooooo low key for rapper jennie to make an appearance  and wait  isn t this tomorrow  wtf  ,1,92,17
i knowwwwww  i didn t think they d wait to give us her last  ,1,61,12
off topic  but what s the origin of jisoo being called miss korea  can t seem to find it online ,1,96,17
save me save me i need your live before i fall,1,46,11
omg i need some hydrogen ,1,25,5
hey can someone help identify from where these are  1    2   ,1,61,11
hating the wait on ros  s ,1,26,5
wow that was an amazingly well researched and thoughtful article,1,64,9
this ginger look suits jisoo very well ,1,39,7
reporting as dead,1,17,3
with open arms  i hope ,1,23,5
oh fuck it s actually happening  gah she looks so gorgeous  the nation s visual  and now i try and prepare myself for ros  teaser  god help me  ,1,144,26
hopefully she turns on the charm and gets him to agree to produce a couple songs for blackpink ,1,95,18
this is so unexpected omg i wonder if she s gonna perform  his  songs with him,1,78,15
 gt  blackpink s upcoming song kill this love is produced by teddy park  blackpink is once again collaborating with teddy  yg s hit maker who has worked on all the blackpink s songs since their debut  all blackpinks songs produced by teddy were chart toppers with longevity  teddy  who knows the advantages  charm and potential of black pink  this time too will be responsible to draw out the best music and concept for black pink  kill this love revolves around lead reed brass and drums which comes together with blackpink s overflowing charismatic rapping and vocals   balloonwanted,1,585,92
i like the red hair but not as much as her natural black     but that high pony tail is fire  consider me slayed  ,1,114,23
spoiler chichu i love you ,1,26,5
oh my jisoo s i am deceased ,1,28,6
so is no one gonna have black hair this era  i m shook ,1,55,12
miss korea pls have mercy on us mere mortals,1,44,9
i d die my friend ,1,18,4
it s just so difficult to be a member of this fandom   haha just kidding how can we not love the four of them  ot4    ,1,118,26
so will rose pop up tomorrow with black hair  ,1,46,9
if facebook had a  marked safe from jisoo s red hair today  status update i d be able to use it  but just barely   ,1,115,22
you re not wrong  it is what it is tbh  it doesn t hurt anyone so personally ima just let it rock  what does kind of bother me though is the way this little girl is basically paraded on social media by her mom  there s just something inherently creepy about showing off how pretty a 10    year old girl is on social media  ,1,323,61
wow  red orange  long hair and that ponytail  oof  jisoo out here to wreck us all ,1,82,16
miss korea snapped,1,18,3
i cannot wait,1,13,3
yeah so jealous of that d ,1,26,6

jisoos christ,1,13,2
i don t wanna set myself up for disappointment  well at the end of the day i mostly care about new music  not how well it exactly does  but ofc i want it to do really well  d   but i believe it will be massive  both digitally and album sales  youtube numbers with new records  etc  say about yg what you want  but these long breaks make sure every release is an own event people are looking for and anticipating like crazy  though i am optimistic that the next wait won t be 9 months again  d,1,492,95
this is such a good red  i love it  ,1,36,9
her visual is no fucking joke ,1,30,6
imagine the mv records they will break  if the fandom has doubled  i wouldn t be surprised if they get 50 million views in 24 hours  ,1,133,25
i could see there being an english version yeah  though maybe they have enough material to make it more than 4 new songs  we will see  that is why we need the track list  d,1,172,35
jisoo taking the word hot to another level   ,1,45,9
the hype is getting bigger and bigger     i really can t estimate the how big it will be when the ep and mv drop    ,1,116,23
i think it will be 4 new songs and then the title track in english  maaaaybe 5 and an english track  ,1,101,21
that ponytail is everything  ,1,29,4
it makes me happy to see more and more fans enjoying what i enjoy  ofc it also brings in more haters and also immature fans  but that is the price one has to pay and ultimately that s ok  ,1,188,38
exactly what i am thinking haha  though i am afraid that it s 4 again and people will be pissed  i would be fine with it though tbh  all i want is one ballad though  pls teddy,1,175,36

can confirm source  checked my pulse,1,36,6
she posted something on instagram where we could see the red hair  instagram story i think ,1,91,16
constant heart attacks     help me  ,1,36,5
she posted on her ig story i think ,1,35,8
jisoo in a high ponytail  consider me  dead   ,1,46,8
i need a track list  ,1,21,5
omg  amazing  i can t ,1,22,4
wait  how did you guys know  i didn t  lmao,1,43,9
for sure  d though the others spoiled things as well  about the comeback  ros  posted some broken heart for example  so tomorrow ros  and then maybe some more info about the ep and preorders  hopefully also some teasers for the music already like with the moving posters last year  cannot wait ,1,294,51
negative  deceased af ,1,22,3

such a queen     ,1,17,5
love the length too  ,1,21,4
spoiler queen  ,1,15,2
she looks gorgeous ofc  sadly we already knew about the hair color so the mystery there wasn t really given  jisoo stop spoiling us lol ,1,136,24
holy shit  someone call an ambulance i don t think i m gonna make it to tomorrow s teaser  ,1,91,16
long hair  vixen jisoo                   ,1,41,4

happy birthday lalisa manoban  please always be happy and healthy  we will always stay with you ,1,96,16
i think she posted at exactly 3 27 am  jisoo really is the best unnie to lisa ,1,78,16
we are a gang  no one wants to mess with us ,1,44,11
and in my area,1,14,4
yeah it looks like it  but maybe she will change her hair that way still  just gonna have to wait and see i guess  personally i don t really care too much about them having different haircolors all the time  but some little changes in style for a cb are still nice i guess ,1,273,53
it looks so much like a wig at the roots scalp so don t hold your breath,1,72,15
just so beautiful   ,1,20,4
happy bday lalisa manobahn,1,26,4
a peck on the cheek from jisoo would be an awesome birthday gift ,1,65,13
okay  not to sound like a hater  this is more about her mom  but how much really is ella involved with theblacklabel  the girls seem to love her  but it looks like her mom  who runs her account  reacts to everything bp so ella could constantly get the jennie comparisons  it feels like she s using bp to grow her daughter s followers so she could have more leverage as an instagram influencer  as a business strategy  this is smart  but no different than media sites and youtube reactors who only use kpop to get views for themselves ,1,534,96
happy birthday lalisa    ,1,25,4
happy birthday u phalanx_13 ,1,28,3
oh yeah i forgot i have the same fricken birthday as lisa  wtf,1,62,13

one can always dream ,1,21,4
happy birthday lisa   ,1,22,4
i hope bp will have another comeback or two before 2019 is over ,1,64,13
i don t think these drama videos belong here  these channels do the most low quality content ever just to generate clicks   ,1,124,22
if i m being honest i bet a huge majority of the people saying they re gonna boycott blackpink s comeback are people who weren t even fans of them before this whole thing,1,170,30
even colbertlateshow wished her a happy birthday  how nice of them   ,1,69,11

holy shit blonde jennie looks amazing,1,37,6
korean versions don t have any english raps besides a few words that spice thing up  i don t know why but i think it just doesn t sound as good as the korean raps and was an after thought  maybe i m just over thinking  need to open my mind to more of these lyrics lol ,1,268,53

happy birthday          ,1,24,2
it s from 2018  spotify say 2018 jp tour,1,40,8
i think the news these days are somehow pushed by umg interscope with some yg media plays too  but i am also very anticipated to the actual craziness when the ep and mv really drop  i can t estimate that provided that 4d was already very crazy,1,243,45
from what i know  it s just a repack album for the japanese market and yes they re all in japanese with the cringy english raps  yes there are korean version of the songs  links   [square one  2 songs ]   [square two  2 new songs and 1 acoustic version ]   [as if it s your last  1 song ]   [square up  4 songs ]  ,1,314,58
i now think it s a wig too since she would never dye her hair this drastic bc she gets a lot solo cf s and this hair colour draws too much attention  but yhe picture looks very convincing if u don t know anything about wigs ,1,224,44
man  so many recently deceased blinks in this thread   blonde jennie  i m dead  i m deceased  i ve shuffled off this mortal coil  so how are you typing that   brains  \[moan\]  who knew that putting jennie in a wig would summon the zombie blink hoard ,1,251,43
yeah that s why i was curious if they would be doing any since there is that gap  i m sure resting would be nice too but hopefully they re able to do some good promo s ,1,168,33
in the part  you can t see any scalp or roots  and the hair looks like it s sort of matted in and around the part to  hide  this  if you look at other pics where jennie s hair is parted in the middle  it makes it a bit more obvious that this isn t how her hair naturally falls  her recent shoot with dazed has a few good shots of this  also something about the way the front pieces fall make the hairline look very undefined and unnatural  my experience with wigs comes from having a friend who had cancer and wore wigs while undergoing chemo  still  i would not consider myself an expert by any means and could be totally off base with this  i m sure there are products and techniques that could ve been applied to her natural hair that could achieve the effects i described above  regardless  jennie is totally rocking the blonde look so if it is her natural hair that was dyed  i am here for it  ,1,899,168
we da blinks,1,12,3
i d kill for 7 tracks  expecting 4 or 5 though ,1,47,10
i hate that western media insists on saying the blinks and not just blinks  it sounds like it is a gang ,1,104,21
the fact that people downvoted you   ,1,37,7
omg i can t belive how pretty this is aaaaa i m ded,1,51,11
yes  there s a 1 week gap in between coachella concerts ,1,56,10
can you explain  not an expert in wigs ,1,39,8
so fake  the titles give it away ,1,33,7
can anyone explain the tracks that aren t from  blackpink in your area   2018  9 songs  that are on here  i don t recognize  5   6   8   9  and  10    what are these  where can i find the album versions  are they covers   amp  x200b  thanks ,1,241,44
is  blackpink in your area   2018  9 songs [    all in japanese  are there also korean versions of these songs  does anyone have links to the corresponding korean version of each of these ,1,188,34
where did you get this from  ,1,29,6
thanks  i m planning too ,1,25,4
going through my day normally and then decided to go onto my instagram acct during lunch   then i saw this picture   i literally screamed omg in a quiet lunch room full of non kpop fan coworkers  i couldn t believe it and had to do some research before realizing that this was not another fan edit  this comeback is going to major for jennie to take this step  wig or not  ,1,373,67
definitely  the part and the hairline are dead giveaways that it s a wig  ,1,74,13
my knee jerk reaction is that i don t like it as well  but i m hoping it will grow on me  seeing it in a mv  on stage could completely change my mind  ,1,151,32
jisoo rapping  calling it now ,1,30,5
is she trying to kill me because it s working ,1,46,9
they are going to have solos  don t worry  ros  s solo will most likely come after the tour  jisoo  s is hopefully near the end of the year or early next year and as for lisa s i think it will come after their next cb which will be next spring summer  after jisoo s solo   which means 2md half of 2020 ,1,302,58
those who buy the us tickets would even receive the new album   amp  x200b ,1,75,13
blackpink  kill this love  track list  leaked yet unconfirmed  1  kill this love 2  love will tear us apart 3  fade 4  beg for it 5  let me hear you 6  let s do it one more time 7  fake smile,1,191,40
i think its a wig  the roots look way too dark already ,1,55,12
im glad i was right about rose having an alice in wonderland kind of theme ,1,75,15
her being shy in korean interviews isn t necessarily a facade   it s just a different side  one that makes sense since she s speaking a second language in s foreign country  also it s not like there isn t s downside in american interviews given that jisoo doesn t really talk at all in them  they both have pros and cons  ,1,322,56
has she said she doesn t like dyes   that said this is definitely a wig  a hairstylist on the  thread even went into detail about how you can tell it is ,1,153,30
lmao thank you i needed that  ,1,30,7
yikes unpopular opinion but i really hope it s a wig because i don t think she looks good with blonde hair at all ,1,114,22
wig for sure ,1,13,3
i m here to comment i m deceased,1,32,6
find one on redbubble or make your own for cheap,1,48,10
lol do y all think that yg made jennie date kai in order to feel the vibe of the song  it s an intense break up song lol so    ,1,127,27
does anyone feel like rose about to get the hair chopped off  or are we getting the dark haired goddess,1,103,20
i m excited to see a change  interesting to see the reactions on other platforms  she really gets hate for literally anything she does  its ridiculous  people complain that she never changes her hair    then she changes it  and people still complain as if she s stolen their newborn child or smth jfc,1,300,50
nah  my scalp didnt hurt when i dyed my hair blonde platinum  ,1,62,11
khaleeeeeeeesiiiiii mother of kaikuma ,1,38,4

wow lisa is looking extra fine ,1,31,6
i really want a short hair jisoo next  pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,1,65,9

april 5th,1,9,2
 1 worldwide,1,12,2
nah its okay  i went from black hair to brown to red hair to platinum and my scalp is fine  jennie should be fine,1,113,24
expect the unexpected  holy molly   blondejendeuki   she really snapped this time  thought she wont touch dye  hahaha,1,117,17
it s working for me ,1,20,4
 i think her scalp should get hurt if she really dyed her hair blonde  perhaps it s only a wig ,1,95,19
you kidding me  billboard and gma interviews were more fun and allowed the girls more freedom to speak than any conservative korean show did ,1,141,24
  yg entertainment   blackpink s  kill this love  is a very intense song that goes beyond ddu du ddu du  plus hints at more us late night promotions   yg entertainment announced blackpink s comeback today with a poster of lisa on its official blog  www yg life com  at 9 am on 25th the ep album name was decided to be the same as the title song  kill this love   blackpink is coming back after about nine months since the release of ddu du ddu du in june last year  yg entertainment said that lisa s first teaser captures the atmosphere of  kill this love  perfectly  kill this love is a very intense song that goes beyond ddu du ddu du also  in regards to the new dance choreography  yge said  the choreography of ktl is more dynamic than anything that blackpink has done before and it will meet the expectations of fans around the world  blackpink s last song dddd music video released in june last year surpassed the record of 700 million views  which is the the highest views for any kpop group music video and the expectations from the upcoming song are very high  the reason why this comeback is so exciting is that blackpink will be pushing their full fledge advancement into us by signing a contract with interscope of universal music group of the united states last year black pink was featured on us famous tv programs cbs    late show     abc  good morning america  and  strahan and sarah  in february this year  broadcast promotion is expected to continue blackpink are also invited to perform at coachella festival on april 12th and 19th  it is the largest music festival in the united states  from there blackpink will start local promotion with north america tour with first show in los angeles on 17th           i am a bot that transcribes allkpop articles  ,1,1774,298

not a fan of jennie s blonde look  especially when it looks like a wig  but still very excited for the comeback  i hope she ll get even more kickass rap lines than dddd ,1,169,32
your link isn t working  now i will have to suspend my yaaasss qweeeen ,1,71,13
okay but since it s a wig  i hope there is a wig snatch moment in the mv,1,72,17
i lost my damn mind,1,19,5
what the what  55555,1,20,4
goddamn it  i can t find my jaw i dropped on the floor ,1,55,12
i m so ready  do you guys think they ll do promo stuff while they re here too   coachella etc ,1,94,17

i can t this she is noe my home screen and lisa is ny lock screen they look so good i ,1,86,20
my girl lisa is slaying that short hair omg  before  as if it s your last  her short hair looked odd to me but now  she looks stunning with it  ,1,144,29

korea s it girl  this 30 sec ad got 3 4 million views in the first 24 hours   ,1,78,17
the hype is so real i m shaking  this comeback is gonna be massive  i m also hoping their schedules overlap with twice  i really need me jannie and nabongs interactions ,1,169,29
when she said that blackpink is called blackpink because of her  she really wasn t lying  she suits black so freakin  well  the same way that ros  suits pink the best  ,1,168,30
it s what she deserves  beautifully talented jichu  ,1,52,7
this is a very well made cf  incredible well made in fact  i ve never been to korea  but if i ever decide to go  i may give them a try  ,1,136,30
i wish she didn t do this    sometimes you just can t mess with perfection and she is perfection in her natural state,1,117,21
finallyyyyyyyyyyy      this comeback better be freaking worth it  and yge better be pullin  all stops  this has to be i c o n i c  worth of their brand  and i have a feeling we are about to witness greatness like never before  i m ready to be slaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyed  ,1,266,48
ros  is getting prettier by the day  not that she isn t  but there is something very alluring about her nowadays  ,1,114,20
yes  100  agree ,1,16,3
she works perfectly for moonshot  never tried anything  but i think i saw lisa eldridge  famous makeup artist  a list celebrities are her clients  plus she works with vogue uk all the time  using it when she went to south korea a good time ago  and she really enjoyed it   i think i may give it a try  ,1,302,57
i think jennie looks better as a brunette than a blonde  but i will get used to this new hairstyle eventually ,1,110,21
i think i saw jisoo sporting red hair on social media ,1,54,11
 the leading ladies of kpop   it does have a nice ring to it  and it s also 100  facts  they are the revolution after all  ,1,123,24
omg i freaking c h o k e d,1,26,9
yah my wig was yeeted,1,21,5
i m here for more content always  let s go blackpink  ,1,54,9
jennie is gonna be the death of me  omg         i don t care if it s a wig  if it s bleach  all i care is that she is blondeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  do you know how long i wanted that to happen  omfggggg       i can t take it  this comeback is gonna kill me  they about to kill love  blinks  haters  everybody  nobody is safe when blackpink is back in town  ,1,360,65
btw  i don t stan jennie quite as much as many of you  but damn does she look good on the cover of dazed   ,1,107,23
she s trying to fucking kill us  shit i actually might be dead right now  whatever i ll make it work  y all better love blackpink or i ll haunt your ass haha  ,1,159,29
redhead jisoo is next  is lisa going to have the darkest hair of the bunch  that will be a change ,1,98,20
did anyone s tickets arrive in the mail yet  i got the vip package but i don t know how it ll work ,1,99,20
i didn t know it before but blonde jennie is exactly what i needed today ,1,73,14
jennie trending  2 worldwide   ,1,31,5
stay is easily my favorite bp song so i m right there with you  i know they re great at the whole girl crush thing and that s what s hot right now  but they could make some amazing ballads ,1,189,36
wow  that is different  honestly i m not sure that i m a huge fan of it but it s always fun to see them try something new and i bet it ll grow on me anyway  jennie was probably the last one i expected to change her hair to this degree  hers was typically pretty consistent comeback to comeback ,1,294,56
we ll always remember where we were when we saw blonde jennie for the first time  ,1,82,15
alright these girls really know how to shake the internet  just when i thought they couldn t amaze me more they come out with this  ,1,132,24
although black is her favorite color  i think being different and makes people wow is the point ,1,96,17
jennie stoppppp     ,1,20,3
wow did not expect this  iconic as she is  this makes her look more mature  in a good way  now with this look i can imagine how intense their concept is going to be   i m not ready,1,180,36
holy fucking shit  i did not expect this  my girl finally dyed her hair     ,1,76,15
yeah  that s what i thought but just wanted to be sure since i just bought my ticket    ,1,88,18
you like my hair  gee thanks just bought it,1,43,9
meta broken   ,1,14,2
[this video is perfect rn]  ,1,28,5
maybe unpopular opinion  i don t like blonde jennie   prefer dark haired jennie ,1,80,12
this is a silly question  of course they will  ,1,47,9
omg i m dead  fucking wow we thought blonde jennie was but a dream  she looks so incredible and too powerful  they really bouta take over the world and i for one welcome our jendeukie overlord ,1,193,35
if jennie is this good i can t even imagine ros  s  may as well start digging my grave for jisoo s teaser as well,1,113,22
oh  oh no  guys they re not fucking around  this is no longer a drill  they were as serious as a heart attack about this song going harder than d4  i don t care how ready you think you were  you re not  we re not ,1,213,42
is this a wig  god i hope not  i literally just screamed ,1,57,12
this is probably a wig but it s possible she just chose not to bleach the roots to protect her scalp  either way  a  look  whoever at yge made this pic knows what they are doing  if you set the twitter original to your desktop  her face is dead center and the top of the screen just reads  love     ,1,299,59
yg stock price is rising,1,24,5
wow the other end of the spectrum     thought jennies hair was gonna stay black ,1,80,14
cannot fucking believe it        shook,1,38,5
if it isn t just a wig  sure  would be nice  i like her in blonde,1,65,15
if it s her real hair i pray for her scalp  ,1,44,10
historical moment,1,17,2
looks pretty real ,1,18,3
this question just make me laugh   ,1,35,7
is there any chance that they will preform the new songs during their us and eu tour ,1,85,17
me too  she is horrible at keeping a secret  ,1,45,10
i am shook rn,1,13,4
they usually keep their hair color changes for the remainder of the promotions  so she will likely keep it ,1,107,19
quick question  is this hair real  honest question  it just seems       different  ,1,83,15
holy shit  she looks beautiful  i feel like everyday they ll release a new image teaser,1,87,15
they finally let jennie dye her hair  they re not playing around this time,1,74,13
so will she actually sport this hair when they comeback and in the us  or is this a wig specifically for the picture  i am not sure  d,1,134,28
is this real or just a wig   ,1,29,7
ohmygooood i think i m getting crazy ,1,37,6
[blackpinkofficial ig post]   [jennie ig post]   [ros  ig post]   [ ygent\_official tweet]   [yg life]  ,1,104,12
she looks amazing       ,1,24,4
holy fuck ,1,10,2
i was just thinking that it would be so cool if jennie went white blonde for her hair color  but that it would have to be a wig because iirc her hair does not react well to bleach  i was really hoping they would do this   yg can afford to drop some dough on human hair lace front wigs ,1,285,58
everyone  get ready for short hair jisoo   ,1,43,7
out of all the hair colors this is definitely the one i expected the least   ,1,77,16
  my wig  ,1,10,2
it doesn t look like a wig  she really did  she died her hair for blinks   ,1,75,16
blinks how are we all alive after this ,1,39,8
kill this love  more like kill this scalp  i m dead though  she looks so good  ,1,79,15
she looks amazing omfg,1,22,4
what  dye phobic jennie is blonde     it must be a wig  i can t believe it  she always looks ready to murder  i love it   and if that blonde is real  i don t expect her to keep it for long haha ,1,194,39
i actually gasped out loud when this came up in my feed  oh my god  it s happening  blonde jennie ,1,98,19
blond jennie came completely from left field for me  this is going to take some getting used to  ,1,97,18
jennie went blonde    i got hella spooked for a hot second,1,58,11
omg please let this not be a wig       ,1,39,9
i am deceased omg,1,17,4
i spoke too soon  guess i ll gladly put away the clown costume   ,1,65,13
i m flabbergasted    jennie is blonde  lt 3  ,1,45,6
i ve just been staring in shock at this for the past 5 minutes,1,62,13
amazing look   ,1,15,2
yge just delay half hour let blinks hanging there   good for you yge  good for you    ,1,86,15
we got an amazing jennie photo teaser,1,37,7
this is a piece of history  bye   ,1,34,7
she is dangerous ,1,17,3
jesus christ  i was totally expecting to see red hair jisoo tonight but this is fucking awesome,1,95,17
my wigg,1,7,2
phsych  blonde jennie ,1,22,3
wow  blonde jennie came unexpected  she looks great ,1,52,8
blonde hair jennie looks like someone you do not want to fuck with and i am 100  here for it,1,92,20
she finally has a new hair colour        wonder if they re really going reverse dddd order  so far so good    lisa  gt  jennie  gt  jisoo   gt  ros ,1,148,28
you guys i actually died,1,24,5
holy fk she let them touch her hair shooook,1,43,9
commenting from my grave  deceased ,1,35,5
i m deceased y all,1,18,3
holy shit i did not expect this,1,31,7
holy shit she s blonde the fucking madmen stylist noonas actually did it,1,72,12
holy hell  i never thought i would see the day  look at her eyes ,1,65,14
i am deceased,1,13,3
blonde jennie      ,1,19,3
  jennie is blonde    jennie is blonde  ,1,40,6
 the leading ladies of kpop   nice ,1,35,6
no teaser today though   ,1,25,4
so i guess we re not getting a teaser today   everyone put your clown suits back on,1,83,17
jobless culture  we don t know her  ,1,36,6
lisa is beautiful ,1,18,3
yesss loving overflow  their visuals and concept are on point ,1,62,10
agreed  i hope we have a really diverse set of tracks this time around  i know the queens will not disappoint  ,1,111,21
i don t think it s been mentioned yet  but props for the mods for doing the header thing  if you hover your cursor on the header  the pic of the pinks  of  the kill this love poster comes up  so cool     ,1,204,41
maybe when they get home from the tour we will get some variety shows ,1,70,14
it sounds like interscope is pushing for the us marketing right now  with yg only really caring about cfs  it s a better option right now ,1,138,25
that true but they re trying to appeal to the us more because of the tour coming up so it makes sense to put them on us shows right now  ,1,137,29
so beautiful  even without the visuals  the song   her voice gives off emotion  ,1,80,14
  selling four tickets    first pair is section 7  row 15 and 16  both seat 18  one behind the other  both on the aisle so you can still stand together    second pair is nearby  section 7  row 19  seats 13 and 14 looking for face value or best offer  let me know ,1,263,54
  selling four tickets for the wednesday  may 1st nyc show    first pair is section 7  row 15 and 16  both seat 18  one behind the other  both on the aisle so you can still stand together    second pair is nearby  section 7  row 19  seats 13 and 14 looking for face value or best offer  let me know ,1,299,61
good bot,1,8,2
got my tickets 1st day of presale  looking forward to this so bad  been a terrible year so far  mother inlaw passed away suddenly and i barely see my wife while shes looking after her dad and sorting all tge financials out  this will be a much deserved consolation prize as all our travel money to korea went to funeral expenses etc  so our big korea trip got canned  but a few days in melb sound great  never visited melb before as well  n z  blinks reprzent ,1,460,86
personally i feel like korean variety shows do a better job showing the members  personalities since they have more experience with kpop idols  but more content is better either way ,1,182,30
i m looking forward to a more intense song especially for western audiences,1,75,12
while we re waiting on kill this love  i d like to share [a little skit]   i made when blackpink appeared on gma  hope you guys enjoy  ,1,135,25
thanks a ton  ,1,14,3
i m hoping for at least 4 songs too  and  hopefully a ballad song ,1,66,13
if u wanna share it here  use the [weekly discussion thread ]  ,1,63,11
i really want more blackpink on my television   ,1,48,9
the original has slightly different ros  and lisa scene s as english japanese versions and also different bgm ,1,110,16
it was the same stuff as the jennie and jisoo parts of the teaser  ,1,67,14
i m so excited for their comeback  i hope lisa can get her dance break which she didn t get and i hope to see more ballad song  like stay  kind of music from them too  ,1,168,34
yeah  that s actually a good idea  hope the other companies would agree  could you imagine a reality show with black velvet  ,1,125,21
i feel that  given the context of the scandal  it would be a better move for more girl group interactions  like a girl power unity thing  ,1,138,24
 gt  blackpink to comeback with mini album this is not a drill  i repeat  this is not a drill ,1,94,19
i m living for everglow rn honestly  if you haven t checked it out yet  i recommend this fanmade mashup of bbc d4  [ ,1,117,21
a literal angel wtf,1,19,4
or square root ,1,15,3
first comeback boys ,1,20,3
i really hope they didn t really mean that the girls literally stayed up 4 days straight for this comeback  i love my hardworking queens but they need rest  ,1,157,29
anyone know why stay on the tour film is the remix  watched the videos on apple music  but on the live album stream its the album version instrumental ,1,151,28
 gt state of   gt jobless culture  no     ,1,42,6
since were getting a song  more intense than dddd   i really hope we get a song even more emotional than  stay  too  i absolutely adore stay and hope we get to hear even more of their emotional side ,1,199,38
rosie s smile  ,1,15,3
yes  i love how the  life is but a dream  concept from the influential literary work  the nine cloud dream  is used and connected to the  fantasy  of the hotel  which bp delivers the whole concept beautifully  ,1,210,37
same  i really hope there s an epic chorus with high energy  maybe something more emotionally charged  dddd was very stylized and icy imo  which was awesome  but i m ready to see some angst and fire  i d love some belted vocals from jisoo  she s improved sooo much recently and her low notes are incredible  ,1,308,53
okay  after watching this english subbed full version cf  i appreciate very much the whole concept itself  in which they use the influential classical korean literature  the cloud dream of the nine  to introduce the concept of  life is but a dream   and then connects it with the  fantasy  thing  of a hotel  and bp delivers such concept beautifully  well done ,1,361,60
i m gonna be honest  i thought that first shot was of rose wearing lace  and i had a heart attack,1,97,20
waking up to new teaser picture and more everyday from now on till 5th  god bless the blinks the girls and the petpinks    ,1,123,24
[eng sub]  ,1,11,2
blackpink coming to slay and save yg ,1,37,7
true  the seungri part will probably catch a lot of other groups with the big net that is being cast  yg also has a tax evasion investigation at the same time  seems like they are being targeted  i just hope it doesn t tarnish the name of blackpink or limit their activities  ,1,276,51
i love how the kill this love cover pops out when my cursor moves to the top bar and the comeback date design  very good details ,1,129,26
not really a lot to say other than being extremely excited for their new ep  i hope we will get information about the number of songs soon  that s what i am most interested in other than actual music teasers  i ll be fine with at least 4 songs  that made sure i am listening to every song of square up  appreciating all the work more or less equally  ,1,351,67
nah  this isn t purely a yg scandal  this hit many labels and more will come out  yg had the biggest hit simply because of seungri being the biggest idol in this scandal so far  ,1,178,34
they said the new song will be more intense than dddd  the most intense part of that was the rap verses  i expect there to be more of that  probably hitting even harder  dddd s chorus was something which didn t hit super hard  so i guess that will be the most noticeable difference  what i am a little bit afraid of personally is a chorus which is just one big break with them dancing  i personally am not a fan of that and the news of the choreo being the most dynamic kinda points towards that  but we will see  at the end of the day i am sure it will be awesome  it is really hard for me to dislike anything bp at this point anyway  even kiss and makeup i learned to enjoy after i was a little disappointed at first  d,1,721,143
    ,1,4,2
gotta be some more english rapping  like jennie   solo   would be helpful material to have for their us tour coming up in support of the mini lp ,1,145,28
i m so thirsty for more teasers omggggg  lisa looking fire  anybody have ideas hopes for the styling song style  ,1,113,17
with all the yg scandals  do you think the other 2 big kpop companies  sm and jyp  are going to distance themselves from yg  i m asking because i love the interaction between blackpink  twice  and red velvet  seems if a concerted effort to create some distance was put into effect  there is going to be interaction between the top girl groups  ,1,344,61
to anyone who hasn t tried yet  these moonshot cushions are amazing  i ll even use them for my wedding makeup  it s twice the price of my usual cushion but it was worth it ,1,172,32
wait   don t tell me the butterfly things were only for this  ,1,62,12
 gt  majorly viral,1,18,3
everglow is awesome  bon bon chocolat has been one of the best songs of 2019 ,1,77,15
all i can say is wow and i still can t calm my heat from that teaser  also  any blinks digging everglow  ,1,105,21
oof yeah i don t know if i would ve figured that out  maybe after a minute or two  if you re that lazy why wouldn t you just go into your settings and add a keyboard shortcut ,1,175,34
bp must be everywhere in korean tv with all this cfs,1,52,11
ugh rose is soooo prettyyyy,1,27,5
when i first heard this i wanted to scream form excitement  but my family does not even know i like kpop lol  they would think i m crazy ,1,137,27
nice to have you here  enjoy the ride  lot of teasers to come  a lot of stuff to get excited about  hope to see you in some of these threads  hehe  d,1,149,32
i found it   queen by perfume genius,1,36,8
there is a eng ver      amp  x200b  [  ,1,39,7
many blinks know that and i think early april is understandable for their rush schedules and because of the shits this month,1,124,22
i m soooo excited when i saw this dropped  new fan of bp  i got into them just after they finished promoting their dddd comeback  been in the kpop scene off and on for years but bp is the only group i ve been diligently trying to keep updated on with their news  twitter s blinks are too toxic and immature for my taste so i decided to create an account here to share my excitement over their comeback because the people here seems more mature ,1,444,83
i agree  it was for international act  even if they kept north america on the list they should have used a canadian or mexican singer instead of taylor ,1,152,28
very relatable ,1,15,2
damn its that bad huh  hopefully the members didn t see those comments,1,70,12
lisa knows ball is life,1,23,5
it is a well done video  no doubt about that  it tells a clear story and anyone getting upset that the girls don t get equal screen time should grow up  p happy they got the chance to work for this hotel  any additional cf work is good in my eyes  helps both parties ,1,267,53
stayed at this hotel    most people expectations will be too low once they actually go so glad bp got to be the models for it,1,125,23
ros  looks stunning here    i mean she always does but wow    ,1,62,12
i think it is definitely interesting  one sees the growth there perfectly    but we knew from their youtube subs that their growth was insane since dddd  so it isn t surprising  d,1,179,32
if they do one  which we will definitely hear about if they do  so don t worry   it should start one hour before the release  which would most likely mean 5th april 17 00 kst ,1,175,33
i thought their comeback was going to be in march  i knew they were going to push the date further than what they said but like no one has noticed  ,1,148,30
her eyes are so wonderful ,1,26,5
hope kiss and make up solo version is included as a bonus track ,1,64,13
3  yg said 6 8 songs,1,20,5
i hope it actually does give a lot more than dddd  i d love to learn some harder choreo from them  or maybe even an actual dance break   the ones for dddd and forever young were kinda lit but i wanted more   i d also like to see that they ve improved on their synchronization as a group  or just anything along the lines of they re improving themselves would be litty            ,1,379,73
what time will the vlive start ,1,31,6
she s unreal oh my god  i can t even imagine how gorgeous she looks irl ,1,72,14
i m actually amazed that this teaser got 3000  upvotes in the kpop subreddit  so excited for the next sets of teaser ,1,117,21
it gets worse  some people just call it d4,1,42,9
everyone s expectations of the hotel are too high now  ,1,55,9
looks like a movie trailer  youtube comment cesspool full of jealous self righteous blonks as per   ,1,100,15
damn the production budget on the cf must be insane  really appreciate the work they put into it ,1,97,18
does anyone know the song  ,1,27,5
omg yesss  i immediately lost interest in the cf when i saw the teaser     ,1,75,15
 gt tbh i prefer this   another ep this year than one full album a year  after about two or three months we might get tired of the full album songs  but another ep before year ends sounds better  amp  x200b ,1,207,39
its what she deserves,1,21,4
definitely a memorable cf  appreciate the efforts,1,49,7
had to delete the first post because it contained only the first part  pardon me   amp  x200b  with the cb teaser out the same day as this cf i dont even care about this one lmfao but at least more exposure for the pinks ,1,221,43
those comments again though  but the whole cf is still good  ,1,61,11
it s finally here   so hyped for this   ,1,40,7
it was posted on  too a couple days back that they already filmed the mv,1,72,15
this is giving me so much k drama vibes  i love it  ,1,52,11
they are supposed to have another ep in the fall and the other member solo s throughout the year  i actually prefer this  since that means we get new music from blackpink all year ,1,180,33
ready for another 3 songs that will be a bop but will play on repeat so much that you ll get tired of the discography again in 2 weeks  i love those guys  i m a blink since their debut but it s fucking tiring not having a full album and not even 10 songs  that said  i m really excited because we all know that the song will be lit  but for how much longer will we have to put up with this bullshit by yg ,1,405,83
ah i see  thanks  looks like the square xxx trend have finished  was guessing it would be called square dance at one point ,1,123,23
not enought  we need like 1 5m views per hour to beat ari s record ,1,67,13
the mini album will be named after the single ,1,46,9
holy  look at those retweets likes  i know that most people don t care about it but for reference the dddd teasers got about 55k  retweets  amp  85k 100k likes while the mv teaser currently has 95k retweets  amp  147k likes   already this teaser has 100k retweets  amp  147k likes   wow ,1,287,45
yes it s very good  can t stop looping these day,1,48,9
ikr   i was like waiting forever but can t really believe when it s actually happening,1,86,14
they would get so much shit for doing that since loona just finished their butterfly promotion ,1,95,16
forever young has weak choreo but it s a very weak song as well imo,1,67,14
can we get like 1m views in 5minutes      ,1,42,9
glad they didn t post a moving teaser like last time  i would ve died ,1,70,13
holy fk yes,1,11,3
yeah probably this  ,1,20,3
 gt blackpink s new song is a song that is even more powerful than  ddu du ddu du   blackpink worked with 4 world class choreographers for this comeback  so the choreography for this comeback will be more dynamic than any other blackpink song before     yg entertainment alright guys    they re going all out of this one  ,1,322,51
same  this is exciting  ,1,24,4
awe  good for jisoo  she deserves the attention  her voice is beautiful    ,1,75,13
beautiful rendition  jisoo has a beautiful voice  i hope she gets more recognition for her vocals ,1,98,16
confusion  what s a dddd,1,24,4
effortless   she gains attention effortlessly  and that s what makes jisoo amazing   ,1,85,12
jisoo nearly losing her mind memorizing the lyrics of this song all for japanese blinks  she deserves the recognition she s getting  ,1,133,21
selling two p2 tickets for the hamilton canada concert on april 27th  \  section 111  row 4  seat 4 5  aisle seats if that matters to you  \  will transfer them to your ticketmaster account after receiving payment  \   550 for both obo   275 a ticket  message me if you re interested or have any questions ,1,306,53
thats a shame  most twice fans being one myself  from what i see on reddit aren t really aggressive care much about fanwars  its actually possible to like the 2 groups like myself ,1,180,29
omg hahaha,1,10,2
they had a preview release for this weekend only if you use [fandango] fandango com   it officially comes out april 5th ,1,120,19
thank you more experienced blink  it s been an education ,1,57,9
vlive channel   free to watch channel    pay to watch  there are more exclusive contents ,1,89,16
they ll have teasers released almost every day concerning the album  the actual m v teaser won t be released until 2 days or so before the m v drops ,1,149,26
channel   is the premium channel which has more exclusive content  the bp members sometimes only upload videos there for example  overall bp doesn t do a lot of vlives anyway though  that is one part they could improve on for their promotions ,1,243,42
update  i ve learned about vlive but what s the difference between that channel and the channel  thing,1,102,16
it is a special platform where idols sometimes livestream and interact with their fans    this is blackpink s channel there  a lot of it is things you might have seen on their youtube channel  but the videos which are livestreamed on that platform are exclusive there  just have to go back to really old videos as well  there is a lot of content you haven t seen i can tell you that  d,1,385,71
hol up  what the heck is a vlive,1,32,8
i woke up to this which is such pleasant surprise    i wonder what s the mini will be called  assuming this is the single track title  ,1,135,26
cf   commercial film they re referring to the paradise city ad that they ve been teasing  if you scroll through this sub s front page  you ll see the teasers they re talking about  so much teasing and hype for a lame minutes long commercial lol ,1,245,41
im so so happy this is also my first comeback i feel like crying  never knew it could be this crazy i cant imagine how the girls are feeling aaaahhh    ,1,152,30
so much same  ,1,14,3
there will be teasers almost daily in the next 2 weeks if it is anything like with square up  pics of every girl like with lisa here  song names of the ep  the cover for the ep versions  some music teasers and then at the end the mv teaser  lot of exciting stuff  hope you ll enjoy it  this is my 2nd ride now and i am just as excited if not more so now  d,1,356,75
im so excited    when do you guys think the next teaser is gonna be dropped  this is gonna be my first comeback with them  ,1,123,24
omg i m shaking     april release lmao i feel sorry for the other groups making comebacks this month ,1,101,17
wait someone hit me in the face  is this for real  i still can t believe it  april s gonna be a bloody battle  this is going to be comeback of the year ,1,152,31
the bold type  it s when one of the characters is going to meet with a guy  and she grabs sexy underwear and then whistle starts playing  iconic  ,1,146,27
my thoughts exactly  i m like do i really need to come at you with all the stats from the rep tour  haha ,1,105,22
ex  lain pls  what is cf ,1,25,5
this will be my first comeback too  can t wait for it  d,1,56,12
do you remember what on tv  i remember hearing it on some ad or tv show and years passes and then i got into them and heard whistle and had the biggest case of d j  vu bc i was like dang iv heard this before  lemme know if you remember ,1,236,50
okay  a very smart move by yg to release the teaser material before the stock exchange market starts in the morning  so the stock price is skyrocketing now lol i think we could expect similar teaser material to be released around these times in the future ,1,256,46
i guess you re right  at least it won t be as late as exo s comeback last year which literally took sm forever  i hope that it ll be another bop  it s going to be another bop  gosh    i can t wait    i m crying right now  urghhh      ,1,234,44
that s one hell of a way to celebrate,1,37,8
i  declare  comeback ,1,21,3
okay after seeing this i am not ready for rosie s teaser  just dig my ditch already  fam  ,1,90,17
we gotta spread the love and the hype,1,37,8
i called the chief and he said that platinum blonde  is  in fact   it   ,1,72,14
yep 2nd time here as well  still just as excited for this one though  from this teaser alone i can tell it s going to go hard  this won t a jyp scenario where we get  bad bitch  teasers but a soft song  bp is officially coming for the throat with this ,1,252,50
omg i totally forgot abt the forever young vid,1,46,9
prepare to not be able to sleep at all the night before it releases  my body willed itself awake at like 4 30 to watch ddu du ddu du when it dropped ,1,149,29
we re in the end game now blinks  i can t believe we re all here for this  so damn exciting  you can already feel it s such a strong concept  holy shit was worried this day would ever arrive but here we are  kill this love  kill this comeback  kill the competition until there s nothing left  ,1,293,53
thank you  that s encouraging  the translation i read also said 4 nights in a row  like the above comment   but sometimes browser translations are quite faulty  so i appreciate when someone posts a better one  that translation  staying up all night  is possibly just wrong ,1,273,45
still a bit later than the schedule but thanks for that i can finally witness bp s comeback,1,91,17
i was so worried they ll be releasing the song this coming weekend  didn t know how will i sneak watching the comeback in the middle of my wedding lol  thank god it got moved  my life will be back to normal by april 5th and i can focus all my energies on my babies  awesomeness lt 3,1,282,54
omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg this is really happening eye sjksfsgdkl i can t wait holy shit this is my first comeback ,1,117,17
because leaks never happen  right ,1,34,5

i cant handle it  oh god i am readyyyyy ,1,40,9
i am shooketh,1,13,3
not legit  i just whet in the korean keyboard and hit random buttons ,1,69,13
it s a j o k e,1,14,6
if this is legit  we got ourselves a breakup anthem  ,1,53,10
this is my first official comeback since i truly got into blackpink right after the release of dddd    and i m just so overwhelmingly happy  i can t wait to see all the hard work the girls have put into this album and music video for us blinks  ,1,245,46
it happeninggggg  her hair is browwwwwwwwwnnnnn  i wished it was 3 29 but a week isn t too bad             yayyyy,1,113,19
at least it s not a single  an ep is fine if they release two eps this year imo ,1,80,18
we ve known this for months ,1,28,5
my first comeback as a blink  got into bp in october of last year and never look back  i have a feeling the song  as well as the entire ep  is going to blow everybody away and set the industry ablaze  ,1,201,41
i cant,1,6,2
  where d you get this from ,1,28,6
omg so jealous   where are you from ,1,36,7
i m excited with you     ,1,25,4

me too  i ve said it before but just got into k pop in november december last year  and it s because of bp  they are the first concert i ll ever attend in my life  and i m constantly keeping up with information and i ve never done that with any celebrities before  now  with all this happening  i didn t know i was going to feel those amount of emotion ,1,353,64
the linked translation says their 4th day of filming not anything about staying up 4 days in a row  so    idk ,1,110,21
ohhhh that would make me feel better   that makes sense ,1,56,10
can we beat ari s record for most views in yt within 24hrs  can we  can we  ,1,76,16
 official lyrics  imma kill this love it s over                                                i m done                  sun                                                                                                                                                                 we can kill this love right now  eh i ll be the one to shut it down  eh                  eh               heart  eh                                                                                                                                                                                          we can kill this love right now  eh i ll be the one to shut it down  eh                  eh               heart  eh                                                                                                 we can kill this love right now  eh i ll be the one to shut it down  eh                  eh               heart  eh,1,913,244

another ep   fuck yg ,1,21,3
it s a great movie  enjoy ,1,26,5
w o o o o o o ,1,14,7
shazam comes out april 4th here in manila so we get both worlds     ,1,68,14
i mean i totally understand that we want it as soon as possible  but we also want it to be as successful as it can be right  and for that to happen about two weeks of promotion and teasers is the best situation  it allows people to spread the word  it allows people to preorder the ep  it s just good business  we waited 9 months already  a few more days won t matter  d,1,370,73
well tbf  none was as bad as the long one between aiyl and dddd  d ,1,67,15
i knew of kpop before because i am a fan of starcraft and korean players are the best there  and kpop acts sometimes performed at events   but it wasn t until i first saw the video of blackpink performing a medley of their songs at jyp s party people that i actually cared for anything kpop  i only saw that video also because a friend of mine was into twice and he showed me this bp performance rather randomly  it instantly catched my interest  especially  whistle  was just so catchy and it actually wowed me  which is funny because i am a big metal fan and that s rather far away from kpop  d anyway  long story short  bp made me to a kpop fan and there probably won t ever be a group which i like more in this scene  it might be an insane reaction  but i got teary eyes when i heard dddd  all suppressed emotions i had during the long wait  all the doubts if that comeback will be what i hoped it to be  everything culminated in that moment and just made me happy  sorry for writing this novel  but that s how it is was  d,1,1027,196
haha  i went thru multiple droughts    ,1,39,7
99  certain it won t happen,1,27,5
it s out officially in my region  guess i m lucky over here lol  great movie you re going to love it ,1,101,19
why     i honestly prefer it to be released by the end of march because i really can t wait already    i think it s going to be another bop  urghhh           i can t   ,1,168,31
the superhero movie,1,19,3
shazam is already out what do you mean  ,1,40,8
same  i got into them because i heard whistle on an american tv show  aityl had just come out  i was around for the d4 comeback  so this is my second one  ,1,155,33
thanks       ,1,13,3
reading all of these posts which say that it will be their first comeback makes me so happy  first because i know how amazing it is to experience this for the first time  and even now the 2nd time for me  it might be even better lol   but also because it just shows how much they have grown  having all these new fans  lt 3 enjoy the ride  ps  that would be a great scene for the mv ,1,383,77
yes exactly  i hope they stay healthy and good ,1,47,9
hahaha same   i m so excited  i m just going through  amp  reading everyone else s excitement  amp  upvoting left  amp  right  amp  can t stop smiling    d,1,155,24
wait    but shazam  comes out on april 5 too  i can t take that much excitement in one day  ,1,92,17
i ve been really feeling that there will be a shot in the mv where all 4 members will walk up to the camera and hit it away a la beyonce in lemonade  i m so into this look on lisa too  literally i m so stoked  didn t get to be in on blackpink until after d4 so just like a lot of you guys it ll be my first comeback     ,1,320,67
nah we not about to do this  swifties literally weren t even trying to win this award  we were going for best song  and we had the votes for it  but still lost for whatever reason  taylor winning this award instead was shocking to us  too  don t come for taylor when she literally just finished the highest grossing tour by a female artist this decade  come for the kca s  they ve aways been known to fix these things ,1,418,76
ahhhhhhhh i am sooo sooo sooo super excited    this is what makes it real for me  a name  amp  a date   and a badass teaser  lisa looks awesome   i m loving the aesthetic  the details about the song so far and this teaser have me expecting a great banger of a song  slay me  blackpink   lt 3,1,291,55
i literally got into kpop because of blackpink  they will always be my favorite group  that was a little after aiiyl got released  so i was a blink during the biggest drought  hehe  did you still get that excited during dddd  especially because of that long wait   like i just got chills and everything when i first listened to dddd and saw the mv  pure joy ,1,358,66
 gt  blackpink are currently filming their mv  have stayed up all night for four days i hope this isn t literal    i know music video shoots can be strenuous  but that sounds extreme  i want a comeback  but i want the members to be healthy more  lt 3,1,250,47
hey  on  the votes are hidden for 60 minutes i believe ,1,55,11
i jumped around in my room alone if that makes you feel better lol ,1,67,14
yes  depending on where you live  april 4th ,1,44,8
i hope the girls get some rest for the next week   they will need it  ,1,70,16
i think the confusion was that they would announce the comeback before march ends but articles were written as if it would release before march ends  in ygs leaked financial report  it did say bp comeback would be the first week of april  ,1,239,43
killing me ,1,11,2
just enjoy the ride  there will be a lot more teasers coming in the next  2 weeks  including some sound snippets for their songs  at least if it is similar to the square up teaser phase   it should be a hobby first and foremost  it will be great ,1,246,48
jisoo said so   back on march 10 ,1,33,6
omg  lisa is so pretty in this picture  of course i believe she is also pretty overall   i m trying to avoid burnout because my excitement level is so high for so long ,1,168,32
just don t engage fanwars is my best advice  it doesn t do any good and it saves you energy ,1,92,18
boombayah era  she looks more badass with shorter hair,1,54,9
fan signings on us please,1,25,5
thank you for the heads up  it s my first comeback also  my excitement is so hight that sometimes i have to walk away from everything internet just to clear my mind  ,1,166,31
like  youre a full of shit blink  when they drag bp s name in a iz one post and i responded like why drag yg s name or even indirectly drag bp in a iz one tracklist post  saying yg is shaking for the 8 song tracklist as an ep ,1,226,48
lisa dance break  lisa dance break  ,1,36,6
where d you get that idea ,1,26,5
i believe it s most likely april 5  at first yg said they re aiming for a late march comeback  and then the most recent announcement was that they re filming the comeback mv but no solid date is announced yet,1,208,38
i would prefer some variety  d one ballad would be nice for once  but yeah the title track should be some hardcore hip hop song for sure    ,1,140,28
maybe they had to do some re shoots  or maybe film some additional stuff  ,1,74,13
in what way   d i don t really visit that sub anymore  the mods are terrible and the atmosphere is rather anti bp in general   ,1,127,25
i wasn t around for the last one either  does this mean mv  amp  album get dropped on the 5th ,1,94,19
please 6 8 harcore hiphop song  that will kill me      ,1,55,10
iz one and twice fans are shaking on kpop sub,1,45,10
comeback time baby   ive literally never been this hype before my girls are gonna drop solid gold     ,1,102,18
they fucking did it,1,19,4
there was mixed information going around  in one it said it will be at the end of march  the other said either that or early april  i like this date more because there is a little more time to build hype  allow for album preorders  etc  so yes this should mean that the music video will be released on the 5th as well,1,317,63
i just plan on not sleeping lmao ,1,33,7
wait  i m confused  yg said their comeback was supposed to be by the end of march but it says here that it ll be on april 5th  does that mean that their only their album will come out on april 5th or does that mean that their music video is going to come out on april 5th too  ,1,277,57
filming mv  i thought it is already done ,1,41,8
lisa is just so damn beautiful ,1,31,6
april 5th confirmed,1,19,3
bts on april 12  but oh well its still bp focus with coachella and north america promotions get it umg,1,102,20
wait that is a thing  oh wow this will be insane,1,48,11
ofc they would hype this up  but man if they really will publish something which transcends dddd in its intensity i will actually die  i remember when i first saw dddd  how emotional that was and how blown away i was  especially due to the rap verses   but also the bridges  everything really   if they manage to do it again  this time with maybe a chorus which hits a little harder still  then i am done for good  d i am ready  i am prepared and i will still have the most insane emotional reaction when i first hear the song  lord have mercy ,1,544,104
that sounds great   i m so excited  ,1,36,8
this is so cute lol ^_^,1,23,6
now stream dddd to a billion views ,1,35,7
bts and bp releasing on the same day ,1,37,8
nice haha i regret stanning them late lmao ,1,43,8
i guess i can be considered an old timer since this is the 4th one for me ,1,74,17
 holy fuck   it s actually happening  hype,1,42,6
i know this feeling  one can get really emotional with one s favorite group    ,1,79,14
one of my favorite clips of ros  hehe  they did so well  the vlive in general was so fun because one could tell how excited they were about it as well    but pls try to finish your work hehe  we will most likely get a teaser almost every day now  different pics of every girl  some teasers for the songs  how many there will be on the ep  etc  lot of hype generation  don t use all your energy just yet  d,1,405,82
i m literally in tears i m so excited      ,1,43,7
its really happening omg,1,24,4
yo close the books on april 4  lol   ,1,37,9
my it clients will have to wait for monday i will be in dnd mode  like when they ignored me during their football team games   ,1,127,25
lol omg that iconic clip  still can t believe it wasn t rehearsed  i m literally shaking with excitement right now    was in the middle of getting some work done but i don t think i can concentrate anymore    ,1,209,36
me   f ck this shit    throws papers into the air  leaves the office,1,68,12
so hype it s finally happening,1,30,5
that is true  i expect some hard hip hop sound here  with another rap part for lisa and jennie where they spit fire  but we will see  i am excited as hell though  and you are right  we would either way ,1,202,41
[stay calm ]  ,1,14,2
lol omg wish i could do that    i have month end so we re working on closing the books definitely not an option for me haha  ,1,125,26
secure your wigs tight it s happening,1,37,6
  important points      a powerful song that transcends dddd   choreo is made by 4 world class choreographers   blackpink are currently filming their mv  have stayed up all night for four days  amp  x200b  [source]  ,1,216,34
i might skip work for this  lol,1,31,7
they should do one  that happened with dddd at least and seems to be rather standard for comebacks  you might have seen this legendary clip from it    they also tease the song there already  some music and footage of the video  i actually got chills back then  d,1,262,48
they could do the bare minimum and we would still be excited about it  but with their coachella perfromance coming    they  know  they have to go hard to blow the public away,1,174,32
yesss  finally   that s awesome   already excited for the next teasers  ,1,72,13
bitch i m ready  she looks so chic,1,34,7
wait really  feelselectoralcollegeman,1,37,3
once again  in gunnery sergeant hartman s words   holy jesus  ,1,62,9
oh man if they do have one i ll be setting my alarm clock  if they drop the album at 6 pm kst and have a one hour vlive leading up to it  that means i ll be waking up a little before 4 am est   ,1,194,45
nobody in my family listens to kpop so i really just expressed my excitement to my dog  he understands finally,1,110,20
that s probably it yeah  they could still be on some other shows which are recorded before liek idol room  we will see  doesn t seem likely that there will be any fan signings though  which is a shame,1,200,37
i feel like oprah right now  an upvote for you  and an upvote for you ,1,70,15
bangkok april 10  then usa,1,26,5
it also says   black pink s new new song is a very intense song that goes beyond  dddd    will this be even more hardcore  damn  o obviously they would always say things to hype it  but man it is working  d,1,206,41
im so fucking happy     ,1,24,5
finally some good news  after what have happend in the past few months  the girls really deserve this and i can already tell that this is going to be massive  ,1,159,30
oh my god  its happening    its really happening  ,1,50,8
i already told another poster who said the same  be prepared for the comeback vlive they will most likely do about an hour before the mv drops  and also be prepared to get emotional  d assuming you are already as far down the rabbit hole as i was when i experienced my first comeback with dddd  d anyway  enjoy ,1,311,59
i know right  i really can t wait oh my goddddd,1,47,10
i bet i will be just as emotional this time  hehe  i cannot wait   ,1,67,15
we did it  we survived all this time and this is the reward  i m so excited for this comeback and lisa looks so good,1,116,24
oops i thought they were real,1,29,6
lisa s been wearing extensions for a while,1,42,7
yess the return of short hair lisa   amp  x200b ,1,48,8
same this is going to be my second time experiencing a comeback from them    ,1,77,15
my first comeback  i m so excited  ,1,35,6
i m queefing,1,12,2
oh my god i was just reading about their comeback on this sub and decided to pop up on instagram   guess what  the first thing that showed up was this photo teaser and i was sh00k ,1,180,36
depending on how deep you already are in the rabbot hole  prepare to get really emotional during the vlive they will most likely do right before the comeback  dddd was my first comeback and it was amazing  d ,1,208,38
wow  she looks smoking hot with platinum blonde  we need more teasers   ,1,72,13
as soon as i got the notification   blackpinkofficial posted a photo  i was like  is it happening  is it finally happening     and guys its happening     ,1,154,26
this is my first comeback i ve never felt this before  lets goo ,1,64,12
we did it kids,1,14,4
i think my heart just exploded a little   ,1,42,8
i m deadass shaking djsjjsjs,1,28,4
are they all cutting their hair       ,1,38,6
yes yes yes yes yes ,1,20,5
omg lisa looks so good  i can t believe it  my first comeback with blackpink    i thought i was getting clowned again after waiting a whole week    upvotes for everyone   ,1,171,31
lisa in platinum blonde ,1,24,4
it s happening even though i was waiting for it i still didn t expect it to actually happen ,1,92,17
i m happy we finally have a date even if it s later than we were told   also lisa looks so good like wow,1,104,22
finally we can stop pretending to care about that dumb cf  lisa i love you,1,74,15
i am ready  lets kill this love together,1,40,8
yall i thought i was ready but i wasnt  what a concept holt hell ,1,65,14
was just about to clmment omg im so excited ,1,44,9
it s happening i m shaking guys ,1,32,5
absolutely stunning   ,1,22,3
lol agree  i really don t see why anyone is upset by this  it s a kids award shows  no one actually takes this seriously  it means extremely little outside of the young audience that watches that channel ,1,204,36
i mean  her tour and her album were massive  massive hits  i hated the album  as a longtime swiftie  it was nothing i wanted to hear  but i can t pretend it s not relevant  it s ok  blinks  no one needs to worry about that  it s a kid centered award  voted for primarily online and the category was obviously more likely to be won by an american artist  kids aren t exactly known for their understanding of global culture  for obvious reasons  if anything  blinks should be happy to see bp was included  any nod in an american award show setting  even one is low key as kids choice  is a sign they are gaining popularity and interest in the u s    ,1,648,117
miss earth,1,10,2
shes so gorgeous omg   ,1,23,5
fyi this is kids choice awards,1,30,6
the avocados xd,1,15,3
hey miss world  you look so damn beautiful   lt  ,1,49,9
she s so damn gorgeous and charming  it s a joy to watch her  ,1,62,13
taylor swift shouldn t even fucking be on that list  ,1,53,9
oh my god  my heart can t take it anymore,1,41,9
cause the kids choice awards matter  lol ,1,41,7
the show has stopped being relevant since the disney ex acts grew out of it  arguably the last generation of teen stars with actual star power  their latest attempt to bring in ratings and social interactions by using k pop artists have been something  still  its accolades are fading and people don t really care about it anymore so y all shouldn t really bother raging at it lol,1,380,64
the votes were way off and even some swifters voted for blackpink to win  ,1,74,14
enjoy    keep us updated on how the soundcheck went,1,51,9
when is it though   xd,1,22,5
wow how gobal    ,1,17,3
we live in a digital music age where you have access to any song at the tip of your fingers  back then you had no choice but to buy a full album just to listen to a few good songs you liked from the artist  now no one has time for that anymore to listen to garbage filler music when there is so much new music out there released daily  album sales in the west are dropping like a rock even from big name artists  did you know drake  one the biggest artists only had 330k album sales last year and that was the highest selling album for the year  compare that in 2010 his first album had 1 8m albums sold  kanye west had 156k album sales for  ye   most money is made from touring and guess what bp is making mad bank from arena concerts for this world tour  to sum it all up full albums aren t what it used to be and the investment in time to produce one can be wasted when the public forgets half the album and the sales are secondary to touring  of course bp need more music for touring purposes but i would say mini albums are the right strategy for this add world and it allows more attention paid to the individual tracks ,1,1126,221
not to be rude or anything but i think the show would still be relevant due to the amount of kids watching their network  regardless of blackpink being a nominee  i still watched the show  i m just trying to be unbiased as possible here ,1,237,44
this is pretty feasible  since yg needs to push blackpink and really make full use of them now considering the state yge is in  because blackpink is currently their biggest potential money maker rn  and they need to do something with their stocks or else yge is gonna lose its investors fast,1,291,52
i thought the comeback was delayed when i read the first couple of words and i almost freaked out   although at this point it ll probably be delayed  ,1,150,27
your statement about how taylor is irrelevant when clearly she s not says a lot lol  ,1,85,15
how am i upset  i said i was surprised ,1,39,9
she won because she s actually the opposite of irrelevant  why are you getting so upset over a kids choice award      ,1,118,20
there will be blood,1,19,4
the world still wants to keep taylor swift relevant huh   ,1,58,10
i really dislike when people hype a release a lot  it raises everyone s expectation and then even if the comeback is amazing  people won t be surprised and will go  yeah well  it was expected   ,1,194,34
they did win the voting but of course this shitty award show used bp for clout purposes and never intended for them to get the win ,1,131,26
this is an irrelevant show that nobody over the age of 14 watches  it was meaningless participating in the voting anyway ,1,121,21
that video of her    perfection  ,1,33,5
it s not like taylor swift was gonna attend ,1,44,8
should be  according to previous releases,1,41,6
where can we see the final vote tally  i want to know how many votes bp got compares to swift  ,1,95,20
nickelodeon s producers  choice awards,1,38,4
we ll finally have 10  group songs ,1,35,6
this comeback will be an ep  yg said they had 6 8 songs ready  but i doubt we will get 8  most likely six  yg said we ll get two group comebacks this year along with the rest of the solos  if everything goes to plan that s 15 songs this year    6 for each ep   plus 3 solos   even if the ep only has four like square up that s 11 songs  i guess is that the second comeback will also be an ep  and we ll get a full album in 2020  which with yg track record will be exactly 10 songs  with one song possibly being a remix of an already released song or a sub unit ,1,561,117
they still have not released a date though   ,1,45,9
thank youu   ,1,13,3
so i m guessing we ll only get one music video ,1,47,9
and also in terms of practical arrangements  bp should not be able to attend the kca awards presenting ceremony      that s why bp is not the winner  i think we don t need to take this too seriously as after all it should be some social media hypes only,1,253,47
agree  those types of moves don t seem to translate well on american shows ,1,75,13
american award show has a global category  but still allow they an american artist in the category      not surprised  a lot of these american award shows are clearly using kpop fans because they know how active they are on social media  especially since it seems as though a lot of the top american artists seem reluctant to a perform and attend nowadays and ratings seem be slipping  the grammy kinda did the same thing with bts  have any kpop groups won an award for their actual music in an american award shows  every time i hear about these award they always put kpop groups in the social media categories  ,1,613,109
it looks amazing omg,1,20,4
honestly  4d blew up like a nuke  i m extremely shocked they didn t win,1,71,13
okay fine u win  i m a fan of both parties  which you could probably tell   i m disappointed that bp didnt win     especially since 4dd was recent  learned the dance in a day lol,1,178,34
stay  gt  ddu du ddu du  gt  playing with fire  gt  as if it s your last  gt  boombayah   ,1,90,19
why do they have so many teasers just for a commercial though ,1,62,12
jennie is really becoming human chanel,1,38,6
who   lt   exactly my point lol ,1,32,5
lol ts7 says hi sis,1,19,5
honestly  nickelodeon s using bp as clouts to make their show at least relevant  in fact  many are now mad  like as in the most angry  ,1,135,25
that s the meaning i took from it too,1,37,8
i mean  it s still global,1,25,5
i hope the dance uses completely different moves from before  they seem to have certain moves  one member does one move  the other member a beat behind and so on  etc  so i hope we get new moves  im hyped for the comeback though  ,1,230,45
yeah sure but what is the goal of a group to become super famous or to satisfy their fans make a lot of money   gt  it s quality  gt  quantity i disagree  just because you have fewer songs doesn t mean they are better it just means you have to put more effort into the few songs you have  i mean out of the last mini album only fy was genuinely good the rest were average kpop songs  not bad but not exceptional in any way  and even then it s far off from how good as if it s your last was  a healthy balance between quantity and quality is needed  as it stands blackpink is like the  apple  or the  supreme  of kpop   gt  it s just a different release strategy and apparently it s working for bp  yeah  maybe but imo it s anti consumer strategy  starving out the fans  so they would definitely buy your album is wrong ,1,819,155
vote counts are meaningless on kca  i had this discussion on another board several years ago when a tv show with the highest votes lost out to another one whose cast would be in attendance at kca and was considered more photogenic and ratings boosting  then it was discovered that in tiny letters in the end of show credits  there was a disclaimer saying that while votes would be taken into consideration  final awardees would be selected at the discretion of the kca s producers  so it s all meaningless ,1,506,88
the account you re referring to is  jennie__style  who had 80k followers  her new account is now [ jrubystyle]  ,1,112,17
right  if the award is for a global foreign artist  then the country the award is based in shouldn t get an entry  ,1,115,21
i don t understand how it s fair to have a north american artist on the ballot  but whatever i guess ,1,101,19
why do you need teasers  you seem pretty hyped about it already  looks like their plan is working  ,1,99,18
the math really doesn t make sense ,1,35,6
didn t bp beat taylor swift by like 1 million votes lmao  what a rip off using blinks to make the award show popular ,1,117,23
say it louder for yg in the back  ,1,34,8
right lol,1,9,2
the square up album wasn t on sale until 5 days after the m v dropped so an album release doesn t have land at the same time as the m v  teasers didn t drop until 10 days before although this is flexible  the m v will either drop on 29th or april 5th to coincide with a friday release ,1,285,55
such a surprise  the north american nominee wins the north american award ,1,74,12
the mv teaser is usually the last one anyway no  iirc the dddd video was also shot like a week before the comeback  there were teasers for the songs still  with the moving posters  or even just the design for the two ep versions  the number of songs  anything really  there not being anything yet when the ep should probably drop in like 6 days is weird no matter how you look at it  why that is  i am not sure  but i would assume the scandals are part of it ,1,459,91
that makes a lot of sense  i was trying to figure it out and thought maybe there was a group just mass reporting them  ,1,119,24
that s sad  that happened to the kylie closet account  lost her page in august and just got it back a couple of days ago  i think paparazzi are copywriting their images  gigi hadid had to delete her own pap photo from her insta ,1,228,43
there was a popular jennie fashion account on insta that was deleted by instagram about 3 times now  a lot of ig closet acc were archiving their posts in case they where deleted as well  ,1,187,35
i doubt it was the scandal  how you suppose they drop teasers when now they re just finished up shooting the m v  yg said the album would most likely drop mid to late march which was just an estimate and it looks to fall in line with that ,1,239,47
everything is already planned ahead of time in preproduction including how they want to edit it and the visual fx work  they just need the girls to present for the shoot  ,1,171,31
we   need   teasers  ,1,21,6
sure but who remembers all of txt s songs where as bp kpop fans know all of bp s songs  quality  gt  quantity  just a differen t strategy and it works for bp ,1,158,30
nah the original comment was implying something along the lines of  ofc he thinks the comeback is good  he was the one who choreographed it  to which i m saying the quality of the music is separate  so even if he himself was involved with the dancing  he can still be wowed by the music aspect  ,1,295,55
selling 2 chicago tickets  ,1,27,4
excitement increasing ,1,22,2
omg that would be perfect  3 29 is my birthday  d,1,49,10
so dreamy  i think this one is my fav  ,1,39,10
try checking   blackpinkcloset  blackpinkwearwhat  blackpinksstyle i was following a jennie closet insta  but i think it may be deleted becuase it s not in my follow list anymore  hope your able to find it ,1,206,33
my body is ready,1,16,4
jisoo solo is  1 on itunes in the philippines  ,1,47,9
well dang  ,1,11,2
ikr  they re such a winey willy ,1,32,6
well in the financial report yge promised its shareholders that they want to focus on more comebacks than in the past  2 per year at least  so that s a good sign  i doubt that we will get all 3 solos this year though  ros  will definitely happen though  the other 2 we will have to see  but it s possible  ,1,306,59
yeah i think yge has tried to leave the announcement as late a possible hoping to limit any backlash over the scandal  it is a shame  i agree multiple smaller comebacks a year would be perfect  you never know yg may stick to his promise and by the end of the year we could see 2 comebacks and 3 solos  i know wishful thinking but i m an optimist ,1,346,68
well arent you just a negative nancy  lol have some faith  ,1,59,11
yeah i am slightly disappointed that the teaser run as you said won t be as hype as with square up  but at the same time i wouldn t necessarily blame yge too much here  it was probably mostly due to the scandals  just bad luck really  personally i hope we get at least 4 songs again  6 would be perfect really  in general i would prefer multiple comebacks per year with lower song count over less with more songs per cb ,1,420,80
yeah  kyle did d4 and kiel did forever young,1,44,9
i agree they haven t really given themselves time to build hype  having said that hype is at fever pitch amongst blinks  it doesn t look like we ll get anything close to the square up teaser run which is a little disappointing  if they are going to comeback on friday that s 5 days to build some hype  that s under the assumption they announce it officially tomorrow  so thats album title and track list tomorrow  we won t get individual member teasers or maybe they will double up if we do  so that s mon and tues  m v teaser wed or thurs and release on the fri  seems rather tight having said that though thats probably all they need but tbh for me if they announce there will be 6 songs on the ep i ll be more than hyped  ,1,725,134
finally  we can enter the double digits in number of songs ,1,59,11
he helped with last comeback but i think kyle hanagami did dddd  kiel tutin has worked closer with yg though as he has done stuff with x academy and done stuff with lisa ,1,170,33
he is one of their choreographers  he helped with dddd but that was also kyle s choreo  he was worked closely with yg and has done stuff for x academy and done stuff with lisa   amp  x200b   amp  x200b ,1,202,36
yes  but it s not confirmed that he s the choreographer for this comeback,1,73,12
is this the same choreographer as last time ,1,44,8
from every angle they re saying this comebacks going to be huge remember they even said the songs are awesome as well i can t freaking wait,1,139,25
jisoo and rosie s solos are climbing up itunes charts in both songs and mv in asia apparently  our vocal line y all   ,1,118,22
there s about a week left in march    wonder if they will just drop the mv without teasers    ,1,94,19
wow  yg really had to open his dungeon to save himself ,1,55,11
this means we re going to be getting the teasers and album preorder soon  finally  ,1,83,14
i m glad you got it ,1,20,5
guys  amp  gals  it s happening,1,31,5
guys  amp  gals  it s happenning,1,32,5
 it s going to be a bop  i can feel it ,1,39,10
bro its happening ,1,18,3
i m glad they re finally releasing a new single  or ep  presumably  but when do we get a full album  i mean how the hell do they program a proper arena concert without album filler  get it together yg ,1,201,38
need the teasers  ,1,18,4
what do you think the name of this going to be ,1,47,11
hey reggie ,1,11,2
choreographer has nothing to do with song quality though ,1,57,9
i hope he thinks it s good bc he choreographed it lmao,1,54,11
bro is this happening,1,21,4
well i think it is definitely coming  too much evidence to not believe it imo  ofc they could always still push it back theoretically  but other than that tiny chance i am convinced  i just want them to create a little more hype rather soon  with actual teasers  articles which confirm it are one thing  having actual information about when it drops  seeing photos  etc is another alltogether ,1,393,68
sunny face,1,10,2
i agree with this  i m so  so  so excited for the comeback and for our girls and i have been for months  but i need something a little more concrete before i m excited  amp  believing that it s actually coming  now   there was talk in the fall of it being before the end of 2018  nope  yg said a while ago it would be mid  nope  to late march  but now that s less than week and we still have no date  name or teaser of any kind  it s not that i m mad about that  i m not  i just need something a  little  more real to anchor my hopes ,1,534,107
this really fit her well ,1,25,5
but someone who just picked up can someone who has experience doing it would be two different things ,1,101,18
these are some of the most incisive comments i have read these days  thanks a lot ,1,82,16
so nothing this week  ,1,22,4
after everything that s happened  they need to stick to their schedule or risk stocks falling further and even bigger investor push back ,1,137,22
ready for impact,1,16,3
i actually not mad at all with this  this helps my wallet a whole lot  many of my army friends were happy but also complaining what did their biases did to their bank account since too much releases and merchandises lololol,1,223,41
hoping for some good news finally  bring it on  i am guessing they will do digital release first and physical a week later as per usual  i hope the physical packaging and bonuses slays ,1,185,34
as an army that s why i m only a casual blackpink fan  a group on the level of bp should release at least 10 song a year  hell  txt just debuted and it s probably going to pass bp in number of songs by the end of the year ,1,222,47
imagine if yg had their shit together and blackpink released new music every now and then  it s sad we are so starved of new music and content  i m really jelly of armys and the amount of content they get form bighit fpr bts  ,1,226,43
i am thinking more about the album  give the fans some time to preorder it  spread the news so everyone knows  etc  there is a reason everyone in the entertainment industry does teasers  it helps a lot to get maximum return  let s say they drop news on monday for a friday release  which is the last day in march it can realistically happen   that s not a lot of time to create maximum hype either  but i could live with it and it probably would suffice,1,453,85
personally  i kind of prefer it as a mystery  it adds to the excitement for me  i fully expect yge to give teasers and a schedule  but can you imagine the buzz if the video would just release randomly this week  people would go crazy and it would be all of the news ,1,266,53
finally  ,1,9,2
can t tell intentional or unintentional typo,1,44,6
as someone who has just picked up video editing  yes i agree big rip,1,68,14
her face  ,1,10,3
my body is ready  ,1,18,4
my mind body and soul are not ready for this comeback ,1,54,10
yeah no problem  i just remembered it to be the case  but doublechecked to make sure  because i am interested in these kinds of statistics  they absolutely had  and i expect them to grow even more this year  if the us promotions are of quality it should be insane   ,1,266,50
awwwww  i think this is my favorite  ,1,37,7
blackpink is the revolution  i hope they will be the first female kpop group to be awarded the ruby play button  50 million subs ,1,129,24
oh god  i guess my brain playing tricks on me   i dont why i remember them having 5 mil if they had 7 when dddd came out  sorry for the misunderstanding  well at least we can agree on one thing  they had an amazing growth since dddd and they are not slowing down  ,1,264,53
blackpink in ypur area,1,22,4
i really need them to drop an actual date  the name of the ep  the number of songs on the ep  actual teasers soon now  i am sure it will be a success no matter what  but give the fans a little bit of time to spread excitement  d,1,228,49
you mean october 2017  because then they had like 4m  around 7m right before the dddd comeback in june 2018  ,1,109,20
yg expecting things as scheduled is already very miraculous to many people,1,74,12
rip video editors,1,17,3
i also got into blackpink and in fact k pop in general back in october last year   can t wait for their comeback   hopefully we get some teasers soon ,1,150,29
we dont have a title yet  teasers should be out by tomorrow or monday  we can have a 3 29 comeback  im sweating rn  ,1,116,23
i remember when i started getting into bp back in october  they had around 5 mil  and now 6 months later  they are at 20   just wow   i am sure they will surpass 30 mill by the end of the year  considering they have a world tour  a cb and will be at coachella  ,1,261,53
something something life is strange,1,35,5
   blackpink completed filming music video for upcoming comeback    according to a report of yg s ceo yang min seok  blackpink has filmed the music video for their new title track  yang min seok   blackpink  who has already filmed the music video  is expected to make a comeback at the end of march as scheduled   however  yg hasn t confirmed the exact date yet  yesterday  jisoo posted a video in the yg dance practice room with a new hair color on her instagram stories  it looks she has dyed her hair red  jisoo said   we re practicing  wait for us  everyone  stay tuned for updates as more photos videos of blackpink s upcoming comeback   i saw that some people were having concerns about the music video  because they thought yg has rushed the music video  yg has definitely had plans for this music video for months already  so they just had to film everything this week  i think we can expect a high quality music video  also  the date of release is debatable  yg has definitely planned a whole comeback promotions schedule a few months ago and if they postpone the date  blackpink s complete schedule gets messed up  so there is a chance that the comeback is still in march  if they postpone the release date blackpink is to join bts and twice in april with their comeback  most companies avoid these things            i am a bot that transcribes allkpop articles  ,1,1373,233
okay  thank you  so excited ,1,28,5
the back view should be jennie s,1,32,6
this photoshoot is already legendary ,1,37,5
so dreamy  her expressions are just  wow  i m surprised ,1,56,9
the looks and the cover are amazing  congrats bae  ,1,51,9
some people in this fandom don t deserve you  but the ones who love you will love you twice as much  thank you for being an inspiration to all  ,1,144,28
that smile  ,1,12,2
the cf is really well made  and as usual  this fandom makes us  sensible blinks  look dumb  how are you going on their page complaining that jennie is getting more spotlight  i swear  some blinks would rather have the girls do nothing  and be equally jobless  then having one of them shine just a bit more than the other  if a company decides they want one of the members to appear more  there is nothing that whining is going to get you  you make them look stupid  and you make us look stupid  on top of that  y all just look petty  why are you complaining  same thing with sprite  people got really in their feelings when it was leaked they wanted jennie alone  but yge insisted on the group  i thought i left the pettyness with my other fandom  blackjacks   but y all are on a whole another level  the fandom is completely fractured and it s less than 3 years  can you imagine the bigger this group gets  it s going to be a battle royale  ,1,942,174
ah  i think you mean the vip package with the after show send off stuff  thats a good question  i think closer to the day there will be some more info  i know at the forum sometimes for vips there is actually a separate entrance parking and a dedicated liaison for the group ,1,275,52
so cute ,1,8,2
mukbang god,1,11,2
still have some tickets left for la show  selling them for below face value  please message me ,1,95,17
it s not the end of march until the 31st my friend  just be patient coming ,1,75,15
it s from her vlive ch  audio only broadcast 181226   29 10  [ ,1,63,12
it could have been an audio only vlive she did  not 100  sure though ,1,69,14
the us  it s aml good now ,1,26,6
red hair jisoo can t wait   ,1,28,5
yes roses_are_rosie go and follow her     ,1,42,7
the drive to the venue isnt too far so i ll go with stubhub   thanks for helping out ,1,85,18
according to yesasia the dvd is region 2  that would theoretically exclude the usa but there are also players that can deal with all discs  i m slightly concerned because i ordered the blu ray and it s region a which includes the usa but is not for europe  and i m in europe     so if anyone knows if or how i m gonna be able to play the disc please let me know  ,1,363,71
what country are you in  ,1,25,5
i get the feeling each member will have their own  story  within the full cf and each have their own cut to highlight their part  ,1,130,25
haha  to be fair i m pretty new to kpop and this is my first bp cb  had no idea they did teasers for commercials ,1,113,24
yes i m learning it too  i think it s one of the easier choreography,1,68,13
i read conflicting news and as far as i am aware no direct news from yge at all  both times it was a yg insider  one said it could be early april latest  anyway  it should happen soon  even if that means     a few days ,1,219,46
yg himself said it was the end of this month  i wouldnt worry  mv was shot this week  will probably drop next week with the ep,1,126,26
i think it is important to try and push everyone in the community to be as reasonable as possible  as we all know the kpop crowd can be rather naive and impulsive  moreso on other social media ofc but even on reddit sometimes  ah interesting  underscores were needed  and i like them at this point  d   anyway thanks a lot   don t get me started on the cf talk hehe ,1,366,69
i bet the come out this weekend  at least by monday tuesday ,1,60,11
might maybe be early april and not end of march  i could see that  but even then  teasers and actual dates should be out soon ,1,126,25
being an idol is also different from being an independant musician  that is something people sometimes forget  ofc they want to make music  but as far as we know noone of them composes  so that is also something to consider  and as i said  they actually got a pretty huge world tour  something ros  for example really focused on in their us interview as well  seeing the happy fans makes them happy  performing music is what they live for  the financial reports suggested that there should be 2 comebacks per year from now on as well  so that is good ,1,551,100
in this day of music piracy  it s usually only through live shows and merchandising for them to make any money at all  i can t really fault any musician for shilling in this new age we live in ,1,193,37
definitely  as there are only 9 more days to go i am really on the edge of my seat  ,1,84,20
no problem    ,1,14,3
great    anyway  sorry again if it was too harsh  but sometimes being direct might be ok as well  let s just hope that the comeback teasers will be out the next few days  it really is about time  d,1,197,39
i ve been that way today  especially with all the cf talk so i get it  i actually mentioned you in a thread awhile back about how you are our own little keyboard warrior  in a good way  and someone else agreed with me  i couldn t find a way to tag you though because of the underscores in your name  ,1,300,59
ah  thanks  didn t know about that feature  very handy ,1,55,9
go to the page and find the globe icon  if you click that it will give you the opinion to choose english  it just has an upper case a  but that s the english option  ,1,166,34
it is interesting that i seem to have that reputation  at least with you  hehe  i probably could phrase things a little less aggressive as well  but yeah as i explained in another comment  sometimes it is just that the general atmosphere gets to me so i might be a little too direct  anyway  thanks for saying it is more or less fine or even required sometimes    ,1,364,68
np i understand  and your other detailed comment took the sting off a little   ,1,79,15
totally agree with you and i d rather have them actually have work rather than nothing at all  kinda like when they had their year long hiatus  i m always happy to know that they have something to do  even if it s not what people want from them which isn t their fault to begin with  we all know how yg is with releasing music ,1,327,62
thanks  this comment definitely explains better what you were saying    ,1,72,11
yeah i am sorry for that  it is not against you in particular either  it is just that i see similar comments a lot and at that point i argue against the general atmosphere which is oftentimes really negative and also entitled  ,1,227,42
translation  and thanks for link ,1,33,5
i am also sorry if i come across as condescending  but as i said it is a really bad timing to say this hehe  d also it is just the hotel teasing the cf  why the comeback teasers are not out yet is anyone s guess but it seems rather confirmed that it will happen for sure  also don t forget the world tour they are on  that is literally what most artists live for  performing music in front of their fans  if we look at bp s history i can understand your comment  we don t have much music for how long they are already a group  they didn t do tours either really  but yeah especially this year we really cannot complain so far i think  and if the financial report taught us anything yg really wants to go through with like 2 comebacks per year in general  which seems fine imo  even if fans obviously always want more ,1,817,156
when an article like [this]   drops it s concrete  the comeback is happening  ,1,78,12
it kinda does  it was a little mean  mods can delete this thread as clearly everyone has really strong feelings about what i said   ,1,132,24
nah you re good  sometimes tough love it needed  you re that friend that is like  bro no  and then we go  shit  you re right  ,1,126,23
is that so  i try to  which might come across as condescending sometimes though   ,1,82,15
they shot their comeback music video this week  they re dropping nee music before the month ends  not to mention they re on a world tour and preparing for coachella  ,1,166,28
viper spitting truth as always  ,1,32,5
sorry  just that the paradise city hype has me kinda heated  they re teasing cfs now instead of mvs   like cmon i understand they re coming back relatively  soon  but i will hold my reservations until i see a real teaser  for now it s just been promises and nothing concrete ,1,275,48
agreed  i know all artists have cfs and make revenue from it  but like you said  they just don t release music as often as other groups ,1,136,26
every idol group is made to hopefully take in revenue from cfs   just looks at red velvet irene    she is everywhere  on yogurt cups etc  the only difference is that we have a mismanaged company that won t release music as often as other groups  ,1,246,45
they are on a world tour and are coming back rather soon  one of the absolute worst times to complain about something like this quite honestly  literally only making this post because there were news about cfs recently  i mean cmon    sorry for being harsh but sometimes i just don t understand certain complaints,1,313,53
didn t the leaked yg projections for the year show that they ve slated blackpink s comeback for april  i know they keep saying  march  but it s already end of march and we have nothing  i m confident they ll end up delaying until april like their internal notices say    ,1,271,45
i m a jennie bias but i m happy if any of the bp members get screen time  because i like all of them  to bash jennie over a stupid reason like this commercial is stupid af ,1,172,35
yesss do it   i learned it recently and i don t know how to dance  i recommend savage angels tutorials on youtube  she explains the moves instead of just showing a slowed down mirror  ,1,184,33
the fandom is so starved for bp content they we are literally fighting over how many seconds our biases are getting in a stupid cf  ugh  i hope yg just releases real content soon for their comeback or i think our fandom is going to have a blood thirsty war lol,1,260,51
does ros  have her own ig account that s not fan made ,1,54,11
sure  amp  x200b ,1,17,2
np    and yes  it s great  ,1,27,6
what s even more fucked up is that they probably did write some of the lyrics in their songs but weren t given the credit they deserved   jennie said she helped write some of the lyrics to stay but where s her name  i wouldn t b surprised if this came out 2b true considering how women are treated in the music industry there  not that this only happens in sk ,1,360,66
looks normal to me for the typical japanese bluray dvd of concerts  it s pretty much 100  before shipping from hmv and other places  japanese media tends to be much more expensive than korea taiwan versions ,1,207,33
whoa is  120 the correct price    i wanted to buy one but really pricey,1,71,14
also the crescent moon emojis around the same time as those blue butterflies as well ,1,85,15
hell ya man  ,1,13,3
if said girls aren t blackpink  i m asking for my money back  ,1,62,11
ok cool  i got that  now the question is  how will they know if its vip  will is show up when they scan it ,1,107,24
oh great    i m going to fit right in as a 30 something male fan at the atlanta show    ,1,88,17
the price isn t really suspicious  tons of scalpers bought tickets and are now trying to sell them because the demand isn t as high as they thought for some venues  there s a really small chance is might be fake but stubhub provides a guarantee that they will refund you if that s the case  there s no way to 100  verify until you get to the venue  stubhub says you should try to call them at the venue if the the ticket doesn t work  they will refund you worst case scenario  for 100  security you d have to buy resale from ticketmaster themselves as they are the ones that have sold the ticket so they are the only ones that can confirm with certainty ,1,654,120
jennie and lisa on black side  rose and jisoo on pink side    ,1,62,13
so i shouldn t be suspicious of the below face balue of the tickets  i have my eyes for ga at  140 each  im assuming it s because no one was buying them at the already ridiculous face value  also is their any way to verify if their legit once i have them ,1,255,51
agreed  she has diverse talents  and is such a great performer  i mean  her on stage persona is just fire  never disappoints ,1,125,22
just watched all the new live videos on apple music and screamed at least a dozen times  ros  on last christmas is instantly iconic  ,1,133,24
thank you for your legit and accurate opinions ,1,47,8
to be fair  jennie is a lot higher on the brand reputation ranking than the other members  i say this as someone who isn t a jennie bias too  so please don t come at me   when companies look at who they want to represent their brand  they take into account the person s reach  how many people know them  how many people respond to them  and buying trends following that person s involvement with other products  jennie has been ranking  1 since around her solo debut  with the other members a bit further down the list  in korea  she is the most recognized of the members  so that is who companies are most likely to use to promote their products  i think it is a coup for the group that the company decided to use all of them tbh  it has to be far more expensive for all four than just one  but i think that as it is a hotel chain they recognize the other members  value in terms of international draw  as a lot of their clientele will be travelling from other countries  i don t reflect the ideas of this company btw  i think all the girls deserve equal spotlight  but it is likely the reason why jennie is the  main  character in the commercial this time around ,1,1165,217
someone might do a cam on periscope or something  but you could always buy the dvds  they just released a kyocera dome bluray also ,1,131,24
ill buy at 150 if you have trouble selling later on,1,51,11
[ga soundcheck tickets should look like this]  ,1,47,7
ppl be camping out tbh  ,1,24,5
call your credit card and see if you can do a chargeback,1,56,12
from paradise city s perspective  it was a brilliant move  every teaser was basically it s own commercial and pretty much had all of us thinking about paradise city for weeks  too bad we re too poor to stay at their hotel so the jokes on them   muahahahaha        \ starts to cry\ ,1,281,49
i remember a while back  wasn t blinks noticing that blackpink members were using butterfly emoji a lot  especially the blue butterfly  just wondering    ,1,154,24
she s a custard roll inside and out  but her creative talent is wow  like what can she not do ,1,94,19
like who wouldn t  i mean  everyone should ,1,43,7
oh man  she s gorgeous  really gives off the young and innocent vibe here,1,73,13
blue suits her so well ,1,23,5
love herrrrrr,1,13,2
thanks for the help  that s awesome then ,1,41,7
oh ok that s awesome then  looking forward to their comeback then  lol,1,70,12
eskimo7474 even used a lot of chipmunks to represent their queen ,1,65,11
she s so cute   ,1,16,4
she looks gorgeous as always,1,28,5
lisa singing  lt 3,1,18,3
she keeps improving in dance  i m sure this comeback is going to lit  ,1,70,13
thank you woori bank for filling in some gap time  looking forward to the comeback and variety show appearances  ,1,113,19
today is a good day,1,19,5
with the integration of social media into culture  it has become a culture of extreme reactions and lack of accountability for actions and words   toxic  is a good description  ,1,177,29
comeback in kpop doesn t have quite the same meaning it does in western media  in the west it implies that the group or artist has fallen behind or taken a hiatus and are making a comeback  in kpop it just means a group is releasing new music  it doesn t carry the negative connotation that the western usage of the word may carry ,1,331,62
yes    exactly    they have a high potential  and i look forward to hearing their own songs    ,1,95,16
they just could not understand that each character they represent has it s own story and it should be evident by the time the full video is dropped  by then  they should realize  or not because they re still sulking over that petty screen time  that the sum is greater than its parts ,1,284,51
jennie  you re killing me ,1,26,4
i misunderstood your intention  i m sorry  im just irritated because it s all i ve seen since the jisoo trailer dropped  lol  agreed  blonks should create their own subreddit  honestly  get that negatively out of here  ,1,219,34
at first i didn t believe that there were so many young blinks  but after i read some statistical analysis of blinks from some news these days  i am quite surprised and the high proportion of female fans shocked me  i thought male blinks should be of majority because bp is a girl group ,1,287,53
she s beautiful,1,15,2
smoking hot,1,11,2
as long as they re being promoted as a group  as what they advertised  screen time isn t an issue for me  just poking fun at those blonks really  lmao ,1,151,28
i think it s because a lot of the fandom is younger  14  18 years old ,1,70,15
oh honey ,1,9,2
god i missed redsoo,1,19,4
lmao this again  i honestly don t give a shit how much exposure time they got in that leaked unofficial video  i m not going to embarrass myself and blackpink like the rest of stan twitter and stan insta because my bias didn t  get enough screen time   it s pathetic  i m going to support them by living for the content and listening to their bops  ros  doesn t need more time if a cf to prove she s worthy in the group  ,1,421,77
not to mention that recent moment she sang in her instagram story with that hilarious filter   ,1,95,17
you really could have enough from that  1sec exposure in the teaser video eh ,1,77,14
i m all for rosie content  especially her on a carousel  yes please  ,1,69,12
yeah  sadly this is really common in this fandom  i don t really see them in other fandoms,1,90,17
so so cute,1,10,3
i thought all this was for the cb  o_o,1,38,9
of the 60 second clip that was posted this morning  rosie was only in it for 2 seconds  even the deer had more screen time lmao  not expecting too much for the teaser or the 4 minute version anymore  ,1,200,39
my silly angle  lt 3,1,20,4
the  sorrynotosorry at the end    why you have to be so adorable like this huhhh ,1,81,16
 i see mango i like it i want it i got it ,1,42,12
omg this is the cutest video i have ever watched ,1,49,10
hi  just messaged you  ,1,23,5
chipmunk looking especially adorable   ,1,39,5
yeah  blonks were to quick to pull the trigger and rage now look stupid    but unfortunately they don t really care,1,115,20
[instagram]    amp  x200b  caption  paradise city x ros  teaser coming soon  \ some of the fans have claimed to have seen  full video  but it is not true  full video still is going to be dropped on march 25th  2019 and it is 4 minutes long  although this is my personal account  since i care greatly about what and how my fellow blinks feel  i have decided to share this confidential information with you   hope you all enjoy the rest of the campaign and be happy        [\ blackpink]   [\ ros ]   [\ chaeyoung]   [\   ]   city x ros  [\ don]   be misled by unofficial  full video  [\ official]   4 minute full video still dropping in march 25th     ,1,650,110
okay  i like the edited flair for this thread   ,1,48,10
completely agree  the commercial looks pretty cool  and i m glad the girls are continuing to get endorsement deals    but did we really need a week s worth of buildup and teasers for a hotel commercial  don t get me wrong  i m happy for any new content at this point  ,1,268,47
why even rehost the video ,1,26,5
you know i never hear  oh irene got a cf instead of yeri  let s hate on her  ot1 stan s need to check themselves ,1,113,22
so apparently this isn t the full version  the one to be released on the 25th is 4mins long ,1,92,18
the original releases were square one  square two  as if it s your last  single  and square up  the  album  right now is simply a live album if you want  which was held in japan which is why these are the japanese versions  ,1,224,42
the hype is real  source   ,1,27,5
face value  messaged ,1,21,3
was sort of hoping to hear axl rose     ,1,40,8
exactly  you can say that again ,1,32,6
yeah it s foolish of them to have so many teasers for a 60 sec commercial ,1,74,15
they shouldn t have dropped so many teasers  photos and clips  for just a commercial  all the hype and time spent for these teasers is too much for jobless blinks to not nitpicking everything  just drop the whole thing and get it over with  i m still waiting for the cb teaser that should be dropped instead of this  ,1,317,57
i don t think they will stop using bp but these shouts are just     too shameful,1,80,16
omg i m seeing so many comments bashing jennie  it s shocking and disappointing  these are comments with literally hundreds of likes calling her selfish  spoilt  lazy  bratty etc  when it s not even her fault she got more screentime or whatever  i didn t release there were so many people inside the fandom that hate jennie with passion  yikes  it sucks going through the people who liked such vile comments and seeing they are all blink  usually lisa akgaes  accounts  the whole thing is childish and immature  ,1,512,84
which is so immature  that s literally the concept of this cf  a girl from the past walking into a fantasy and hanging out with each girl  blinks are so quick to judge and ruin things for blackpink  imagine being a company  see this stupid backlash over nothing and deciding not to use bp  also  how embarrassing for the girls to have to see their fans act like this  ,1,368,68
i feel like it ll still be jennie centric since she seems the only one who s wandering around the  paradise city  and the solo stans will be even angrier ,1,154,27
that makes sense,1,16,3
yes i agree but i still hope that they will edit it  this is getting annoying,1,77,16
they re getting a lot of backslash on instagram and twitter and that eskimo dude said that the actual cf is 4 minutes long so they better make something out of it ,1,163,31
y all need to chill  andrew oh just updated saying this video is not the full video  and the real one is 4 minutes long  that clip was probably one of the many cuts they will run on television  ,1,194,38
and in fact only jennie is really engaging in the plot here as shown  while the others     i hope they will edit it  ,1,117,23
not to be controversial  but they should have filmed a cf with just jennie  i would be super happy for jen if it was just her getting the gig  but it s a group ad  amp  jisoo  ros  and lisa look like secondary characters  literally jennie and the girls  man  idk  i m a bit upset by this ,1,288,56
this advert isn t really for blinks  it s going to be shown on tv and other places to attract customers to the resort  some of these blinks feel so entitled to how a company needs to run it s ad campaign ,1,204,39
yg  no talk about the comeback jisoo  nah  i m gonna ,1,53,10
isn t that in the yg dance practice room,1,40,8
lol she went through all that secrecy with the black n white ig stories just to now show her hair colour  jisoo knows how blinks are feeling   ,1,143,28
good to know   thank you  ,1,26,5
yes  it s so annoying all this kids bashing on jennie or any of the members because their bias didn t get same screen time i mean come on why do they even call themselves blink if they only support one member     ,1,213,41
lol good observation though  exactly  it is really funny lol,1,60,10
i think the official paradise city youtube leaked it  [link]   but immediately deleted  they should be editing it now,1,117,19
so wait the whole thing is leaked  ,1,35,7
i know it s just a commercial and doesn t matter but the other girls do really look like extras in this  feels like it could have been done better ,1,147,28
to be fair  the deer got more screen time than the other 3 ,1,59,13
jisoo knowing our pain  taking care of us ,1,42,8
okay  that s strange   good to see it there  ,1,45,10
it is quite a mess now lmao  i think because of this leakage  this advertising campaign is somewhat ruined now  i don t know how to say  this thing creates so much hype for many blinks but now    haha i can t stop laughing now  amp  x200b  but yea  many blinks are so childish  this attract many haters for bp too,1,313,58
 gt this whole fandom is so toxic with it s solo stans it s really pathetic  this so much   my tl on twitter is so childish  like my god it s just a commercial relax   gt   lt ,1,176,30
so if you check into paradise city you ll start of by getting a free mediation class and then you ll see this beautiful girl walking on the ceiling inception style   you ll then see another beautiful girl on a carousel  you ll then see yet another beautiful girl standing in the swimming pool area surended by blue butterflies and a giant rubber flamingo  you ll then see this handsome guy and then suddenly you re in a big party room ready to party and have fun  ,1,464,80
now they re attacking that eskimo guy  it s so childish  obviously it s a commercial that follows a narrative structure so they can t just randomly show all the girls equally  of course they re gonna attack jennie that has nothing to do with it  really dissapointing this fandom sometimes ,1,289,46
yes  i don t know why they have so much time on complaining about this and that,1,79,16
to be honest i don t really care it s just a commercial  this whole fandom is so toxic with it s solo stans it s really pathetic ,1,129,24
[source]    amp  x200b ,1,23,2
this is quite hilarious   and no teasers for lisa and ros  now lol ,1,67,14
 lol  jennie s screen time is even more than the total screen time of jisoo  ros  and lisa  ,1,92,17
lol  jennie s screen time is even more than the total screen time of jisoo  ros  and lisa ,1,90,17
this looks to be like the whole ad don t know what happened to the teaser schedule lmao ,1,88,17
releasing music  ,1,17,2

hi blinks  i m in a bit trouble and need some help  as soon as tickets went for sale for the tour  i bought them immediately from vividseats  my first concert as well  and spent way too much for some top row seats      800 total   now that prices have gone down  i see that i could ve gotten much better seats for that price  not only that  they re telling me that i ll be receiving my tickets from email one day before the concert  i tried contacting support and it s not going well  what should i do  should i sell my tickets since there s no refund and just buy through someone else  it s stressing me out due to how much and the fact that i may not even be guaranteed these tickets ,1,686,129

they were allowed at the g dragon sydney show but it s best to see if the venue post anything beforehand as qudos can be pretty strict  worst case scenario you ll have to cloak it which is free at the venue ,1,207,39

hey blinks  if you re interested in buying 2 tickets   for the upcoming concert in chicago lmk asap    i m selling them at a heavily discounted price  thanks    ,1,161,27
does this mean it s only being made for japanese region dvd players  too  or do we know if it might be more widely available in the future   other sellers countries  other regions  ,1,181,30
so its my first time buying a ga ticket and was wondering how early i should line up to get to the front or close to the front of the stage,1,139,31
hey  feel free to repost this with the date included in the title   190322 jennie says she s excited for blackpink s comeback  talks about being  human chanel     ,1,163,26
is t his only available in japan  i remember jisoo teasing some kind of concert film on instagram but i didn t know it was available ,1,133,25
you can do it  here s a good breakdown of the dance  [ ,1,55,12
a mix of both because they do both a black and pink concept well and it d be nice seeing them do both in a single album  mini album ,1,132,27
i already love the vibes this is giving off lol,1,47,10
this looks so good   it feels like i ve been waiting for ages for her solo lol,1,78,16
both  the title song will be black but i am hoing for a slow pink jam like stay ,1,80,18
this entire aesthetic really suits her  ,1,40,7
so when do physical tickets ship  i m waiting for my seller to ship mine from stubhub  ,1,87,16
lmao  picture of yg   ,1,22,4

hi  i m selling two tickets at a discounted price  are you interested ,1,70,12
would love an updated one of these when the whole thing drops  it s cold to get a film majors take on it  ,1,106,22

anyone want 2 tickets to this show  pls pm trying to get rid of tickets  ,1,73,15
jfc how much can you be expected to be hyped for a damn commercial    ,1,70,14
what is this a solo debut or something ,1,39,8
just some info  i emailed yesasia and asked them about this  because i was also considering buying there  and they told me they don t get it in stock  i also asked a local kpop store near me and they told me that this item is not allowed to be sold outside of japan unless you are a registered japanese seller so i guess that s the reason why many stores don t get this in stock  luckily my local kpop store is registered as a japanese seller and gets some in stock  ,1,467,91
   we   love   lisa    ,1,23,7

sorry  what s a cf  ,1,20,4
yall  its a cf   amp  x200b ,1,28,5
yay  so excited ,1,16,3
i think people missed the point of the video  it s an inception concept  dream sequence  where reality becomes fantasy  i think 1 2 the owners of the comments are too young to remember inception  oh well ,1,204,35
she looks so good in blue,1,25,6
can t wait for her teaser,1,25,5
why do you even imply that he wouldn t let them write their own songs  don t just make things up to fuel the easy narrative of yg being evil  maybe the girls don t want to   don t have the ability to compose their songs  maybe they are not good enough  what is most important first and foremost is good quality  the girls at least said that they have influence on the work with teddy so there is that ,1,401,77
comments are stupid  but dear god jisoo is jaw dropping ,1,56,10
yeah stay isn t black or pink but straight up blue ,1,51,10
visual queeeen ,1,15,2
i think half of the songs will be more on the pink side  they did say that they wanted to make songs with a summer vibe to them ,1,128,28
bought from kpoptown  hopefully it comes in 1 piece haha   amp  x200b ,1,70,11
i mean  you could push your way up  vip has their own section i think  i could be wrong though ,1,95,20
if anyone is worried  remember this one probably cost a whole lot of money  that last cg shot probably took a loooong time  her part did take time and money,1,156,30
hey  who here has attempted to learn the ddu du dance  i need inspiration ,1,74,13
did they ever talk about wanting to write their own songs  genuinely curious,1,76,13
i d say [hmv japan]   is your best bet  or you can probably find it on ebay somewhere ,1,86,17
off topic  but where can i buy this  i checked yesasia and neither of this shows up there   ,1,92,19
stan loona,1,10,2
dddd dance practice,1,19,3
would you believe    black in the pink  \ badum ching\ ,1,55,9
i just want to see them shake it like this  [  i just want to see them kill it at coachella  thats why i m hoping for a more black side of them  ,1,145,32
hotel casino i think  was confused for a while as well  ,1,56,10
who are paradise city  all i keep getting is the gun n  roses song ,1,67,14
yea but i think it is inevitable though  anyway  there must be bias but overall it should be fine  as solo works within a group is not a new thing for kpop groups  any new materials releasing will make everyone mad already haha,1,227,43
i m just over this whole  my bias  vs  your bias  stuff  it s immature  i hope it won t get worse with all of the solos coming but i know it will  so disappointing ,1,164,32
from this  i think we can somehow foresee some of the responses towards the next member  ros  s solo debut now   ,1,113,20
here i am  thinking of the butterfly comeback theory again  ,1,60,10
blonks lolol i forgot that s what they are called ,1,50,9
stay  i dont know why but i coming back to that mv,1,50,12
i see two general definitions of  pink  whenever people bring up the duality of bp  some define it as the opposite of bp s main girl crush concept  which is the cute concept  but others refer to anything that s softer  that s not the electronic dance banger type as the pink side to their black  i would agree  aiiyl is the most  bubbly  and cute of their discography  ,1,369,64
honestly  this song is so good  i would watch an mv for this song 50 million times  just me ,1,92,19
cf for a hotel casino,1,21,4
indeed  the hashtags say a lot,1,30,6
blackpink isn t a dual concept  so   it ll be blackpink ,1,56,8
serving truth to blonks ,1,24,4
that is interesting because i think see you later and especially really were something blackpink hasn t done before  so there was already a fairly good mix imo  i still agree though  at the end of the day i want them to release interesting pieces which most of the time means something rather unique and not copy and pasting the same sound over and over again  ,1,361,65
what is this  her solo debut ,1,29,6
[source]    amp  x200b  caption  hey friends  well  many fellow blinks warned me of potential complains if any four of the queens were seemingly treated less equally than others   well i totally see what they meant   i understand some of you have been disappointed for sometime due to some members of bp seemingly being treated differently than other members    with all due respect to your own personal points of view on this matter  i for one think bp is only bp and is so great for the four members  own unique individualities that are so different from each other  yet still make a one great team as whole  i think jisoo s teaser is absolutely awesome and beautiful  1 5 seconds shorter than jennie s because it focuses on her side of the story without the deer running around   instead of demanding 1 dimensional equality in creative outputs  i think we should focus more on supporting and celebrating each members  great achievement of being the great global artist that they are  individually and as one team  i am very happy and proud of jisoo and her teaser from my campaign   and i absolutely do not think any of the members of bp should be a subject of comparison to each other as they are in no competition to be better than others   they should be celebrated and rather be appreciated for their individualities and unique differences from each other  but this is a free space  so i hope you will find means of self expression of your minds  as long as they are not delivered with profanity  vulgar display of hate and anger   for those of you who care to  please enjoy the rest of the campaign and be happy      sincerely    \ differences  in  individualities  and  creative  expressions  do not equal to  inequality  keep calm and jichuuuuuu   amp  x200b     there we go  immature blinks again and again      i feel sorry for eskimo7474   ,1,1853,314
damn  visual af  what a beauty   ,1,33,7
everything prior that album   i like it  on free sm shows the first signs of their new style  ,1,94,17
i mean  blackpink doesn t really do all pink or all black concepts like other dual concept groups  rather than a dual identity  their different colors are more of a spectrum  even their brightest songs like aiiyl have that black edge to it  and vice versa  in other words  it will certainly be both  it s just a question of which way each song will trend  my hope is that their title track is split right down the middle to introduce their new audiences to their concept  while the ep itself trends pink  since square up trended so strongly toward black   and  well i miss that lighter side ,1,591,103
guys imagine if this is jisoo s solo concept,1,44,8
god damn,1,8,2
yes    jennie s teaser has much more content  background  deer      and even jennie s hanbok style like a movie  that s why it appears much longer than jisoo s one here,1,168,28
only by 2 seconds  jennie s was faster paced  there was a lot of stuff happening  it felt like a movie trailer teaser lol  jisoo s feels more like cf  i m also dying at how gorgeous she looks    ,1,195,36
that sounds awesome   can t wait to see it myself  hopefully my blu ray  version 2  comes soon  ,1,96,18
was hoping it was a bit longer and maybe also an outfit change   jisoo truly is the visual of this generation  ,1,111,21
it s interesting how they toned down the choreo to make it less sexy  less butt shaking etc,1,91,17
second this  jisoo is so gorgeous ,1,34,6
bitch     i m ready ,1,20,3
she s stunning from any angle ,1,30,5
kind of disappointed from the length  and lack of change in scene and outfits  but not surprised  at least jisoo s pretty smile makes up for all of it  ,1,152,28
i need more pleeeease,1,21,4
clc s latest song is more mature dark girl crush kind of like 4minute  bp song s don t really have that feeling yes it s girl crush but they maintain an innocent girlish charm to them which is why they also attract very young female fans ,1,238,43
i agree mate  feels like is much shorter than jennie s teaser ,1,62,11
too short   ,1,12,2
plz jisoo you re killing me    [instagram]  ,1,44,7
playing with fire and whistle,1,29,5
i agree  but its a shame  there should be space for both ,1,57,12
does the crystyle qualify as old songs  if yes i couldnt disagree more with you  mistake  liar and hobgoblin are straight bops ,1,127,22
well shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit ,1,25,2
you ve been knew  man  i got my eyes on you  too     s,1,54,13
aiiyl  the girls just look like they re enjoying themselves so much in that mv it makes me so happy ,1,100,19
although stay was a ballad ish folky soft song  it s still on the dark side so i feel like it would be classified as one of their black songs  aiiyl and really is most likely their pink side songs  but true  even their pink side songs are more powerful and different than other groups  songs,1,291,54
as long as i get a banger and a ballad i don t care ,1,52,13
nerd tactic  let the jocks beat eachother out and hide in the back then come in for the final blow,1,98,20
that s good to hear  i ordered ver 2 and can t wait for it to arrive ,1,69,14
i hope it s black  people are sleeping on clc  but they used to make very pink pop songs like twice  but then changed their approach completely  they are making very black songs now and i personally vastly prefer their newer songs over their old pop songs  ,1,257,46
i d want a mix of both tbh  and i hope their discography diversifies their sound as well  while i really loved  square up   i think they played it safe with their songs in terms of production  i really do hope they put in slower songs and heavy hitting songs in this upcoming ep  i want blackpink to musically evolve over time while taking the best out of what makes their sound unique  don t release stuff for the sole purpose of meeting the number quotas on the charts  but rather the longevity of the group  ,1,511,94
does  stay  actually qualify as a  pink  song  overall it s a ballad and it doesn t really fit either pink or black  i d say  as if it s your last  was their most  pink  song  ,1,176,33
aiiyl because i never got tired of looking at it  ,1,50,10
bp doesn t do  pink  the same as other girl groups  their softest song is stay and even that s more of a ballad than a proper cute concept song like twice s stuff  my ideal album of theirs would be 3 2 bangers to softies ,1,221,42
i believe yg said her solo is going to release after the comeback this month  so maybe a may or june release  maybe later ,1,122,24
it s been confirmed that by the end of this month they are releasing their comeback  no date yet  but they are filming their mv this week  ,1,139,26
i think mainly black with 1 pink,1,32,7
probably black as they are signed to umg and western usually prefers strong and powerful songs rather than cutesy poppy song,1,124,21
i like all bp m v s but stay is the most memorable to me ,1,57,13
cant wait to see your editing  lt 3,1,35,7
man  this was a hard question to answer  i really like all of them  but i would have to go with boombayah  it s the combination of rollerskating  sweaty jisoo and lisa s rap that puts it on top for me  after that  it would probably be aiiyf  i love that video s happy  summer song feel and all the looks the girls have  after that its a tie between whistle and dddd  followed by another tie between stay and playing with fire  embarrassing admission  i sometimes actually get teary eyed watching their videos  i probably need therapy ,1,534,94
im still waiting for the day yg stops being an     and lets blackpink write their own songs  im curious on how the girls can write songs  the only example on where the girls wrote the lyrics was the korean parts of jisoo s cover of clarity but that s simply hearsay ,1,266,50
aaiyl for sure  ros  looks absolutely stunning  jennie s cute pouty face  lisa s adorable head bop  jisoo with the heart magnets  its just such a fun video overall ,1,164,27
i totally agree about how eye catching d4 is  i picked aiiyl  but combining how much i love the video  amp  song  d4 would be my favorite because it s just so beautiful to watch  the scenes  fashion  colors  amp  lights are all so eye popping and visually compelling  i also adore lisa  amp  jennie s rap scenes  i mean  how do you beat eating popcorn on a bejeweled tank on a shopping spree   lol it s very unique and just has so much energy visually  but i think it also gets a lot of energy from that song  which is my favorite bp song  so i picked aiiyl for purely the video   i do love that song  too  but i love it with its video even more  if that makes sense  ,1,668,127
so i have two rivals now  who else  i d go through all of you to get to my queen   s,1,84,20
well  i was here first buddy  so y all have to get through me first   s,1,71,15
i love each of them for different reasons but i think my favorite based purely on the video is  as if it s your last   i love the playful concept and humorous bits  jisoo trying to make those heart magnets meet up and staring at them with such a perfect mix of confusion dissatisfaction indifference makes me laugh every single time  jennie s  look  at the camera in the scene with the stuffed animals  lisa s head shake  rose s surprised expression on the stairs  she s just so pretty  too  i love her writing her name in lipstick  the fashion is super fun  as well  i love the contrast of the black uniform look with the bright pink backdrop  ^ blackink    the bright colors  the casual look in front of the yellow wall  jennie s subway outfit might be one of my favorite looks any of them has ever worn  the way they just look like they re having fun  laughing and blowing kisses at the camera  it s just such a fun song  and the video 100  commits to making you feel that ,1,976,173

the first half of the video was about one tv talent in japan saying how she likes blackpink  especially jennie   and she usually tries to sing their songs with the choreography when she went to karaoke  later on  she also explained the concept of blackpink as a girl crush group  who are rather cool than cute  after that  there was an interview with blackpink  which was actually aired back in october last year when they promoted ddu du ddu du and the area tour in japan  in the interview  they were asked if there are any japanese songs they like  jennie said jisoo loves mika nakashima s song  specifically the song sakurairo mau koro         and jisoo covered some of mika nakashima s songs in their concert  so the group started listening to the songs and they absolutely fell in love with those  after that it went on to show a sneak peak of jisoo singing yuki no hana      another song from mika nakashima  in their concert at kyocera dome osaka last december  that the dvd  amp  blu ray of this concert will be out soon this weekend   come the last was their performance of aiiyl ,1,1089,194

do you guys still think that they ll come back before the end of the month  there s still no teasers  even just a simple title track reveal  with a date  will relieve me from this worry ,1,186,35
will blackpink perform together with their band at coachella  ,1,62,9

as if it s your last is my favorite  playing with fire is probably my least,1,75,15
what a goddess  ,1,16,4
playing with fire   whistle in close second ,1,44,8
as if its your last  really catchy song  individual spotlight given to all 4  them coming up together with blackpink in your area at last  i am not as captivated by their newer songs as aiiyl did  ,1,197,37
she s so gorgeous without even trying   ,1,40,7
whistle for sure  dddd is my second  ,1,37,7
maybe  variety shows are filmed ahead of time but that still isn t enough time perhaps for long shows  maybe they will go on weekly idol ,1,137,25

i have two ga floor tickets available  unfortunately i can no longer make it to the show and am just looking to sell these at face value  please send me a message if interested  thanks ,1,185,35
thanks for sending the suggestion  i ll check it out and see if i can   ,1,72,15
okay  blackpink in hanboks needs to be out of bounds ,1,53,10
whistle 100 ,1,12,2
the video editing in whistle are soooooooo good  but dddu is so unique and eye catching,1,87,16
whistle  the director did a good job  the transitions are way cool  ,1,68,12
looks like it s a commercial  after googling to make sure paradise city isn t some edm group  turns out it is a hotel resort  ,1,126,22
jennie on that tank was iconic ,1,31,6
i d say either stay or d4  stay is a really beautiful music video and it just feels so clean and pure  d4 is awesome though because theres so many cool scenes and who doesnt love seeing jennie throw some popcorn off of a bedazzled tank  ,1,237,45
whistle   i really like all of them though ,1,43,9
for me personally  it s whistle  gt  playing with fire  gt  boombayah   stay  gt  ddu du ddu du i feel like the whole production of whistle was at another level  the music video is truly art  playing with fire just blew me away during lisa s part ddu du ddu du   i felt a bit let down because i had crazy high expectations i guess  the sets were amazing and really different though ,1,382,69
australia is sold out to my knowledge  and europe is nearly sold out with some venues only having packages and platinum tickets available  dynamically priced so they are expensive af   and neither have many resale tickets available  australia  amp  europe do a far better job at handling scalpers when it comes to the law and pressuring big companies  in australia it s illegal to resell tickets for more than face value ,1,421,70
i see a green screen  movie magic is gunna happen  ,1,51,10
more attractive than my entire being   ,1,39,7
even lisa s hands are attractive  ,1,34,5
i think the second fort worth show will do alright as well  its seems to be selling  europe and australia shows look like there selling well  all in all i think this tour will be a success  your on point the haters and the antis don t need an excuse to attack bp  they clearly have nothing better to do ,1,303,59
thank you for explaining the situation to me  lt 3,1,50,9
i m so excited for their comeback    ,1,37,6
i wouldnt worry about this too much  with their comeback dropping in a few days  as well as their coachella performance  which they re going to kill   the turn out for the rest of the tour will be just fine  never listen to the toxic people on the internet it isnt worth it  people will say and do anything just to kill someone elses joy  ,1,339,64
they are sold out  it s just scalpers bought a lot so there are many up for resale  the 2nd newark is most likely going to sell out too  it s like 60 70  sold out already and considering their comeback  amp  promotions i wouldn t worry  tbh antis and haters will use anything to mock bp  whether its the concert tickets or something else it won t stop  that s just how it is  ,1,376,69
try seat geek and sing up using a youtubers link  extra  20 off,1,63,13
me too i m completely confused i don t know if that s like a movie or a commercial or new music video i m totally confused,1,122,23
imagine bp rocking out to gnr   ,1,32,7
love it      could you edit  eyes closed  by chaeng like this version with adorable effect please  here is the link [ ,1,118,22
totally agree  if they go and kill it at coachella  that will change everything  especially if the new mini album is dope which it will be ,1,139,26
yes  sorry about that ,1,22,4
there is always a chance  there s still time but looking at resale sites its not looking great  like i said until the actual concerts it impossible to say how many people will be there  scalpers may have tickets on more than one resale site  the comeback may get people to buy ticket  its impossible to say for sure  honestly i m just speculating i have no real idea what will happen  ,1,385,70
i ve been trying to understand what is this for   i just don t get itt  can someone explain    ,1,95,19
i think after coachella  we ll have a better sense of how big the us crowds will get  i m a new blink myself so i can see them getting many more at coachella  ,1,159,32
so there s a chance that bp is still going to have a large amount of turnout at their concerts and i can tell those  journalists  to get their facts checked  d,1,159,31
    thank you   ,1,16,3
thanks mate    appreciate the support  ,1,39,7
you mean yg not jyp but yeah they will paid all the same  interscope will take their cut as well  i would imagine interscope are the reason bp are playing such big venues  my biggest concern is that playing to half empty venues kills bp confidence and passion for performing but until we know actual turnouts its hard to know how empty they will be,1,348,65
blinks are paupers especially when it s the season of drought ,1,62,10
she always does look gorgeous  she gives out a different vibe here though  also  this is for their paradise city cf  not their comeback mv ,1,139,25
luca  me lisa s finger  any tiny morsel of a crumb of new bp content,1,68,14
she looks gorgeous here l  was hoping she d have her lighter hair for this mv but it looks like she s gone dark again,1,117,23
unless the scalpers have a way to sell them back to the venue  which would be stupid on the venue s part  bp jyp got paid as if they sold out  right  ,1,150,30
try stubhub or seatgeek  i ended up getting mine through stubhub because i had the exact same issue as you  although the show i m going to is sold through aix not ticketmaster ,1,176,32
holy shit she s so pretty   lt 3,1,32,6
i hope jisoo wears hanbok too ,1,30,6
now i know we re rivals   ,1,26,6
what a beautiful woman  i m in love   ,1,38,8
awesome feature  ,1,17,3
i ve tried on both the app and my computer  both get the same issue  i did purchase red velvet tickets a couple months back with no problem  i m not sure if it s because these are resale ,1,187,36
well i was totally wrong about jennie covering guns n roses,1,59,11
are you using the app or a computer  cuz i recently just bought ariana grande tickets and the app wasn t working for me and saying the same thing but then i tried on the computer and it worked just fine  ,1,204,40
yes  hanbok is classy too ,1,26,5
ooooooh  i m a huuuge fan of the traditional outfits  and i secretly hope everybody gets to wear them  it s something that i wish more kpop groups did   lt 3,1,157,28
tbh i was very surprised when blackpink booked prudential center in newark  capacity 20 000   there are long established  very popular groups   bands in the us that would never book prudential  maybe they saw bts selling out these same venues and figured bp could generate the same amount of ticket sales  no idea how they do the math  probably a lot of guessing and black magic  ,1,380,66
they are technically sold out  unfortunately tickets are up for resale meaning that scalpers bought up a lot of tickets  as to why the tickets that are up for resale aren t selling even though there are a lot under face value is anyone s guess,1,243,44
unlikely and i hope that doesn t happen  promoting alone  when the group is not promoting  like jennie did will get each of the girls more spotlight and recognition and also ensure that they get media coverage for a longer time throughout the year ,1,248,43
i see  just kidding ,1,20,4
sorry  it really wasn t my intention to do so  my internet connection has been acting up lately  so i guess that did it  i have already contacted the mods for this issue ,1,170,32
lol are you too excited so you posted this three times in a row op  ,1,68,16
i m still confused but i m all for this  whatever it is  jennie looks stunning  i can t wait to see the others ,1,111,21
after seeing jennie s  im so excited for the other member s teasers  and the whole  epic collaboration    ,1,106,16
this looks like a k drama i would binge watch   ,1,48,11
when they were filming this collab i remember reading they had filmed late into the night  past midnight   wow this is only a teaser for a casino but it legit looks like one for a drama   ,1,188,37
secretly hoping this means jennie s covering guns n roses,1,57,9
best anime jisso yet,1,20,4
i want one,1,10,3
it s been 7 hours now        ,1,29,5
this is awesome  need more of this  keep going buddy,1,52,10
damn  jennie looks good with the korean traditional clothes  can t wait for the rest of the girls teasers  ,1,107,19
that s a lot of tongue action  ,1,31,6
thank you  just looked it up  surprised it s free for something so powerful  ,1,77,13
she looks sooo good ,1,20,4
i guess it will be a teaser for each member everyday until release on the 25th ,1,79,16
thanks a bunch      glad you re interested and sounds like you re an after effects designer too  here s a video where i go over exactly how this was made    plugin mentioned in the video when i get to  gear  is called paint  amp  stick for ae ,1,243,45
good job     ,1,13,2
wow    jennie wearing traditional korean costumes  i didn t expect that  ,1,73,10
holy s      [source]  ,1,22,4
wow  ,1,5,2
beautiful work  i think you should dial down the screen shake though  also    how did you make it this fluid  the default paint system in after effects is meh  is this some sort of plugin  ,1,189,35
thanks    noted   ,1,18,4
hey guys  new blink here  i m so excited they are touring europe  but i can t help but think  why are tickets sold out almost everywhere except for europe    also this is the first time i m going to a concert  any tips for a noob like me  ,1,239,46
wow you can even add an image in the flair  ,1,44,11
i think a sticky thread would do fine with updates ,1,51,10
anyone know of any fanclubs doing anything for the us dates ,1,60,11
well rose didn t know either,1,28,5
loved all the animations   just not the shaking ,1,48,8
not sure  but they re one of the biggest for sure ,1,50,10
how big are they compared to other banks in korea ,1,50,10
hmm i definitely gotta decorate my apartment with these  also side note  woori bank is the best bank for foreigners in korea  their global atm has the highest withdrawal limits for foreign visa debit cards and the smallest fee ,1,227,39
i couldn t understand a single thing  too complicated for my peanut brain  great job tho  ,1,90,15
lol i think at least they will go to the event in person,1,56,13
here s a video on how this was made      software used  adobe after effects,1,75,14
how did you make this  what software did you use ,1,49,10
i was overcome with the biggest mixed emotions today as my ga tickets to their la concert left the seller s possession and is on their way to me via ups  what pissed me off was ups showing that the package dropoff happened in maryland  which reminded me again how i was scalped but i just had to buy them  but i m so excited because this is finally going to happen in less than a month    my feeling is bp will still play all \ their\  old songs  but get rid of jisoo and rose s covers  and maybe solo and kiss and make up as well  assuming they re adding 4 5 new songs to the set   i wonder what they ll do with lisa s swalla segment  because that s even less than a cover but seems to be wildly popular  from their asian tour   ,1,730,139
i m willing to be very patient about their comeback but this whole build up to their partnership with a resort chain seemed very underwhelming from beginning to end  i first thought paradise city was some dj i never heard of and they were gonna collab  whatever  new pics i guess ,1,280,50
lookin classy af,1,16,3
can mods create 1 thread for this or stop allowing this because it seems like there will be many more from this guy  apparently this is the  beginning of a series of teasers that will be released progressively according to the campaign story line  ,1,248,44
can we just have 1 thread for this mods  that guy who is promoting this thing is sort of spamming this stuff i think  ,1,118,24
thanks so much  puts a smile on my face to hear you loved it    ,1,64,15
happy to  thanks for the feedback and support       ,1,52,9
thanks  and yea theyre pretty fun and simple to do  just take a lot of patience  for me it s kinda like knitting,1,112,22
thx  maybe i ll try it sometime for fun ,1,40,8
adobe after effects  here s a video on how this was made     ,1,61,12
to my amatuer eye this is very well done  make some more ,1,57,12
this stuff was shot in february  something like this should have no affect on the comeback  i understand the frustration though as we re still basically clueless on their upcoming comeback ,1,189,30
it might bite them in the ass if it s not  epic ,1,48,11
you the dude that does bp videos every morning  haha your videos shows up on my recommended  ,1,93,17
how about bp promote their upcoming songs and mv instead of a hotel ,1,68,13
what software do you use to do this ,1,36,8
i love this  you did amazing ,1,29,6
i love these  you did an amazing job ,1,37,8
i see these types of edited dance videos for bp all over social media these days  they seem to be a big hit ,1,108,23
thanks   i m thinking of posting an entire video of the process actually  it took about 18hrs total for this segment so i wanted this out early since the whole dance would take much longer  ,1,190,35
you re welcome  ,1,16,2
that s pretty cool   the whole video would be awesome,1,53,9
that s an awesome idea   ,1,25,5
thanks for the kind words   ,1,28,6
      thank you  happy to hear you love them  ,1,46,9
this would be fun on beat saber,1,31,7
two words that mean a lot to me  thanks for the compliment friend   ,1,68,14
thanks appreciate it     glad you love it   ,1,44,9
incredible effects  loving it  ,1,31,4
this was extremely well done and i hope that girl gets tons of views  these are the kinds of talented  low budget  remakes i like to see  not the more popular but absolute shit work done by people like lankybox\   \  what s most annoying about them isn t their budget but the frustrating way they constantly break character every 5 seconds to laugh at their own lame jokes  i m sure they re high as fuck but they really resemble that situation where they re the only ones stoned and everyone else in the room watching them is sober ,1,532,95
top tier,1,8,2
i love these  great job  ,1,25,5
i totally agree  calling it an  epic collaboration  definitely made me think music  i also assumed paradise city was some kind of band or dj name until i follow the instagram link and realized it was some kind of casino or hotel  i m happy the girls are getting deals like this because promo for them is still great  but i wish the account posting the teasers wouldn t make it look like something it isn t ,1,406,74
whoa  i was just watching your blackpink house ep3 reaction  thank you for enjoying bp and promoting them  ,1,107,18
on the day d4 was released  we had exactly 8472 subscribers ,1,60,11
wow  always thought lisa was from bangkok  learn something new everyday lol ,1,76,12
well done ,1,10,2
i understand your last point and i am hardly an expert on south korea but the companies you re talking about are american and the attitude over here seems to be a little more relaxed  is it the same way in korea  i think people are more willing to  look the other way  in na if a company continues on after someone involved screws up  from what i gather  again  not an expert  a lot of the sk public are raging at seungri   rightfully so   and with yg himself not being the most popular figure to begin with  i don t know if everything will be alright  i certainly hope it will  i also hope that if yg is out as ceo that they put someone with    how can i say this     more sensitivity in charge  ,1,697,134
hi jason  3,1,11,3
damn that camera work is on point  ,1,35,7
you re the best  it is the best  rose is the best,1,49,11
no problem  i ve never actually seen teasers for a cf before so i was slightly confused myself at first  it doesn t help that the phrases they are using such as  epic collaboration  is basically clickbait  making you think of something music related  interesting marketing strategy to say the least  ,1,300,49
thank you   i appreciate the explanation  lt 3,1,46,7
cf stands for commercial film and is a blanket term for all endorsement type things where you make money  my guess is it will include all of them  we don t necessarily know the full extent of what it will be  that s why they are teasing us i assume  they might do some event there  a photo shoot  or they might part of advertisements for the place  there are cf songs but those are very rare and i highly doubt it  bp has never done a song for a cf ,1,449,89
just after 0 59,1,15,3
0 58 is the time stamp,1,22,5
i saw somewhere that he purposely made his now wife s group flunk so they could date     that s pretty fucked up  honestly tho i don t care about him enough to have am opinion  ,1,177,33
can you please eli5  lol i m not familiar with the term  cf  and i thought last time there were posts about this collab that it involved all the girls  this snapchat just says jennie  is this a full bp project  just jennie  is it a song  but not the comeback song ,1,264,51
[their ddu du ddu du cover is at 40m    views ]   and the girls said this about it    ros   amp  jisoo     very impressed  the choreograph and background are exactly the same  love it     lisa     very proud that they are from buriram like me  glad to see that buriram kids are also great   ,1,291,49
thanks everyone  maybe im just too nervous about the whole ordeal and i don t want anything to cause a problem  whoever is traveling to the concert  see you there ,1,163,29

omg hey  lol  yeah it s me    and thank you for telling me  i wasn t sure if it was a new song or something else haha  ,1,119,26
no  it s just a cf  ,1,20,5
hey are you nicholas from youtube   i mean do you have a channel on kpop   if yes then hi  i am a subscriber   and btw this is not related to their comeback   they are promoting the paradise city hotel in seoul  ,1,212,44
so jisoo is blonde   ros  is kinda pinkish blondish   lisa probably will do a darker shade  and jennie will be like dye   what s that  ,1,135,27
is this a new song   sorry  new to this stuff haha  ,1,52,12
woah  this is some epic innovation  ,1,36,6
sorry but is this part of the comeback ,1,39,8
wouldn t have expected ros  to post something like this tbh  but i am loving that she does it  would have loved to see it without any filters as well though  d,1,159,31
who is chungha  and which song should i stream   newbie me wants suggestions  ,1,78,13
what s nice about bp s western appeal is that these posts makes us newb westerners learn about artists like sunmi  who is she  and tell me which song i should stream  ,1,167,30
this makes me hella uncomfortable ,1,34,5
it should be fine like everyone else says  have fun at the atlanta concert  i ll be there too   so excited ,1,107,20
classy and elegant,1,18,3
thank you eskimo for filling up the gap,1,39,8
i really want to smoke whatever she s smoking,1,45,8
i feel like its blondesoo since her hair color looks really light  but when i look at it again it looks caramel ugh i dunno  but sis can pull off both really well so not complaining,1,181,36
call me black widow babyyyyyyyyyyyyy,1,36,5
i didn t think it was awful lol,1,31,7
this is so cute,1,15,4
i checked   for her dazed cover   ,1,34,8

and it is only a cf teaser  most likely  from which we have so many updates     while for the actual comeback     ,1,114,21
wait  wont we find out for sure on the 23rd  they re going to the kids choice awards arent they  ,1,97,19

yes   which makes me think maybe lisa will go red hair again  would be so cool if they all get bright colors  ,1,110,22
it is happening  don t worry  it will come some where in the second half of the year  ,1,86,17
blonde sooya would be life  ,1,28,5

if you haven t seen it yet  search for jisoo s acting bit in the kdrama  the producers  pre debut ,1,98,17
i have a theory  since the comeback was already rumored since last month  what if they already filmed a mv even before all the scandal blew up  and the newly reported mv being shot this week is for a 2nd song  what if bp will be promoting 2 songs from their ep  double the songs to promote  twice the hype  more revenues to recover yge s stock downtrend ,1,354,67
it s like everyday a new record  wow,1,36,7
hey rapist incel  did you hang yourself yet ,1,44,8

yes and no  seungri did damaged the yg brand but he did not destroy it  but you cannot blame the criminality of an individual towards the company when its an individual crime  is it fair if you did something wrong the whole community blame your father for example  people keep calling yang hyun suk a creep or scum when you don t know him in real life  i e just because he married his wife quite young  do you know that his marriage is one of the reason why his brother in law by his own admission did not sunk to depression and commit suicide ,1,544,103

at least one ballad pls teddy  just want to hear a really chill song even slower than stay coming from them  just one is enough  i want to sleep and chill to bp  because yeah teugeowo teugeowo like fire isnt really helping lmao,1,227,43
although i agree with you on eps making song more special  for some reason my favourite songs have always been b side that almost nobody listens to and having 4 big bop everytime makes it a bit  too much   not that i m complaining ofc but maybe i only need some ballads to hear coming from them ,1,295,55
oh man i love this fancam  r cord is truly     when it comes to the multi angle fancams and editing    i feel like recently her editing has gotten fancier as well  with the graphics and texts  ,1,193,37
i took my rv lightstick with me on a flight for redmare  and i know a few people that have taken bangtan bomb light sticks  i don t think you ll have any issues  though my experiences are anecdotal ,1,198,37
best thing to do if they ask what it is is to just be honest about it  the less suspicion and questions the better really  might be awkward embarrassing but it shouldn t be a problem,1,182,34
all the things you ve said in this comment are arguments used by antis to undermine blackpink s popularity  either you re an anti pretending to be concerned  or you re falling into their narrative  and considering this is clearly a throwaway account you made just to post this comment  i m leaning more towards the former  ,1,323,52
ros  fansites are   ,1,20,4
as well as the  next year  jokes,1,32,7
lol thanks  i am also cautiously optimistic that they ll give her a new look this comeback  but i might end up disappointed   amp  x200b ,1,137,23
i am anticipating her new look too  by the way  your flair  ,1,60,13
sorry if i came out too harsh  was really not my intention  and yeah  hope we can all just enjoy the comeback    ,1,113,23
beautiful work   ,1,17,3
alright alright calm down  i m not gonna be a party pooper  originally i m not  since it s definitely a great news bp is gonna make a comeback  all the best to their comeback cos the girls srsly deserve it with how strong of a fandom they currently have ,1,254,47
been rewatching my favourite bp videos to feed my comeback hype and i had to share this   my favourite fancam of rosie so far  this performance was like punch in the gut    in a good way  she absolutely killed this  ,1,216,41
i think that little mix probably wants it too  i m sure they want to expand in the west as much as kpop wants to expand in the west  i think it would be good for one song at least  and it would be a good scratch on the back for both girl groups  i think that little mix s image is compatible with blackpink  at least  i think with  salute  because i don t know any of their other music   but i think that it ll be cute for one song  two if it s a huge hit  but after that  y all right about having a dj like steve aoki  ,1,520,106
what has navers bias to do with the content of the comments  especially when the naver article couple days ago about jennie at the hera event was mostly negative  with lots of mentions about yg   naver  helped  allegedly with pushing certain articles to the main page or deleting certain articles  but nothing about the comments  people on those posts are just happy about a blackpink comeback  don t know why that is so hard to accept ,1,436,75
imo for this comeback  i actually think it s good that it s an ep instead of a full album since they probably won t be able to promote it properly fully in sk  i d rather wait for the full album even more than have it almost wasted if yk what i mean haha,1,254,50
nah it s not ,1,13,3
get in line buddy,1,17,4
so excited for their comeback  will they be changing the songs performed at their na concerts  i still want to see them perform their classics ,1,143,25
i think it s rose in her new solo song,1,38,9
stop it  you are killing me wiyh excitement ,1,44,8
i think for the paradise city cf we are going to get actress jisoo  prepare yourselves  ,1,88,16
i would hazards a guess it s in fear of a copycat attack and that wouldn t apply wouldn t be as riskyto a non manchester arena,1,126,22
i just read that lightsticks will be banned at their manchester show  probably having to do with security after the ariana concert bombing  but if it s such a security threat i wonder why didn t they make it for all of uk and just there  i hope that doesn t happen at any n a concert  where we re so paranoid about security   lightsticks are essential to completing the ambience of looking like a kpop concert ,1,410,72
omggg never knew i needed this collab till now,1,46,9
yg isn t going anywhere  the man is untouchable ,1,48,7
every member of yg represents yg at all times  that s what it means to be part of a group  also it s one more example of how yang hyun suk is a major creep  ,1,157,33
perhaps he s a blink,1,20,4
looks like lisa,1,15,3
well yg probably still doesn t want to overflow the market with comebacks either  they still want to be a little more  special  than the rest if i had to guess  but the report mentions 2 comebacks a year  which is imo totally reasonable tbh  vip s don t matter  well they still need to be interested but i am sure they are  what matters is that none of the remaining 4 artists get caught up in this scandal  if there is any connection between any of them and seungri in all of this then it s over for sure  as it stands seungri was the weakest link anyway  so bb should be fine on that lvl ,1,590,113
yeah it was below 10k  not exactly sure about the concrete number though  but we grew a lot since then  that is for sure  another tell  their youtube subs  before dddd it was around 7 million  a little bit more than that  now we are over 20m,1,241,47
i d imagine it s more like a tightly packed work schedule for this kind of work  you know  the one where you ll most likely pull a couple of  almost  all nighters and work extremely hard but when the dust settles you have a long break to compensate for the past few days you ve been destroying your body ,1,304,55
what was the sub number before the iconic ddd era  was it below 10k ,1,68,14
yes in fact doing more comebacks is just a common sense for entertainment competitions  bb should be okay with the remaining 4 actually  i believe many vips know how to act now,1,176,32
so excited for their comeback  ,1,31,5
you know naver invested in yge right     naver has always been biased to yge for quite some time now so ofc the comments are going to be supportive of bp too,1,157,32
the financial report which was posted here said that yg wants to do more comebacks in general now to build more trust  aka build stronger fanbases  it also said that they plan on bigbang still being a thing and frankly i totally see that happening unless they get somehow connected to the seungri stuff as well ,1,311,56
oh that would be nice  i was hoping for a comeback stage there but hey that sounds even better  showcases are usually enjoyable  the ones i ve seen   ,1,150,27
i don t think it s too big of a deal anymore considering how much this sub has grown  they get downvoted early but end up 95   way later  i think it just has something to do with reddit s algorithm and the fact that this sub gets brigaded hard by people  it s not as bad anymore compared to jennie s  solo  and dating news era  that shit was pretty bad during that time  ,1,371,70
that it is an ep we knew for a long time already  so people freaking out over it not being a full album make no sense to me  d i ll also say it again  i prefer them only releasing eps quite honestly  makes every song a lot more special  something i cherish instead of listenign to 12 songs once or twice and then picking like half of it and never listening to the other half again  with that out of the way  i still would love there to be more than 4 songs this time  6 or 7 would be great to have  about other people saying this is rushed  well it is in the sense of there not being any teasers and not even a real date yet  that is the weird part quite frankly   but the negative connotation i get is that they think the quality will be worse than it should be  i really don t see that happening  they worked on this for a long time now so musically everything will be great  most important part   all the extras for the album are most likely done  photo cards  photobook  that stuff simply takes time to produce  and what we are looking at is them only having to film the mv  that one is done rather fast  the real work for the mv is the work you do before shooting  getting the concepts straight  building the props  etc  then the editing  but even that s not a huge problem  in the end the video is like 4 minutes long at most  that doesn t take hundreds of manhours to edit  overall i am just extremely happy it finally seems to happen  this is my 2nd bp comeback and if it is any like my 1st  holy shit    will be super interesting to see what the growth during the dddd era actually accomplished in fan size  the 24h youtube views will be an interesting milestone data point for that  i am expecting around 50m views personally  but we ll see  hopefully this sub grows more as well  i still remember the days of below 10k subs  i wonder where we will be in say 3 months from now  anyway  time to get excited  comeback of the year is just around the corner ,1,1964,380
i heard kamu at kfc here,1,24,6
this may be a bit of a  rant   so i already apologize beforehand  because i don t really want to be negativ on this subreddit  but    could we please not downvote the posts of the girls  i m talking especially about their ig posts stories etc  this is their subreddit it would be stupid to specifically downvote their content  not talking about  fanmade  things or trollthreads  i say this because in the last couple of weeks i just randomly noticed it more and more  especially with jennie  amp  sometimes rosies posts  like 98  is whatever  but the ig posts from jennie yesterday went as far down as 91   till i complained somewhere else about it and the people there brought it back up a bit  lol   some of her older posts are even under 90   the rant is probably useless as most people  who downvote don t care or even look in here  lmao  but i kinda wanted it off my chest  i love all the girls and don t want this place ever to be like twitter with their endless  ot everything but 4  whining  as all 4 girls make blackpink and without one member it would never be the same  sorry for the wall of text  t_t on a positive note  i m so happy about the comeback news  already waiting for pre order to start etc  finally new music  a fresh new mv  looks and so much more     ,1,1277,235
in his recent mercedes ad  he s wearing black and pink  haha  just coincidence but funny   ,1,91,15
i think yg should bring more bp comebacks in the future  provided that bb is now     ,1,85,16
i think i read that her solo will probably come once the world tour is over  so i doubt we will see another cb before it  ,1,122,26
omg this is happening  stay calm  this is happening  the girls are coming  new songs  new mvs  new hair colours  new dance practice videos  new vlives  new promotional interviews  new set list for america tour ,1,210,35
i m really excited for the comeback  despite yge rushing this  i m just  so excited  for new bp content  i had hoped it would be a full album  i guess not  guess they re not getting that album of the year  or daesang  anytime soon  too bad  they deserve it  i wonder if rosie s solo will come after this cb  or a group cb again before her solo  nevertheless  i m so excited  so excited for everything that s coming up  it will also be our maknae lisa s birthday soon   so many things to be thankful for  ,1,504,94
english versions,1,16,2

prettiest girl on the earth,1,27,5
is the girl one of our girls  jisoo s hair was black then  lisa and rosie s hair was lighter than this  jennie s was darker than this right  im confused right now,1,162,30
i wanna see what interesting stuff they do with their music  when i heard the second part of forever young  i was shocked  complete change of song but so effortlessly made as a transition  they do so many unique stuff with their songs  if we get to see how they make songs  that would be amazing  ,1,297,56
the majority is not negative   ,1,31,5
what articles are you reading  the vast majority is positiv  and don t even talk about yg   especially the first one on naver  can t talk about nate pann  but who gives a shit about those 2 sites anyway as they are basically the equivalent to 4chan ,1,249,44
that s my girl     ,1,19,4
of course ,1,10,2
yes  please   u haven t paid stock to any of these collab rumours  but i really would love for  this one  to happen more than anything ,1,135,25
i just want anything bp related lol we ve been starving for content for so long ,1,80,15
if i m not mistaken  jimmy fallon is in new york while jimmy kimmel is in la  so i think kimmel will be closer to them  idk tho     ,1,132,28
we are getting fed ,1,19,4
jaaaason derulooooooo,1,21,2
but i think this is a cf still,1,30,8
teaser videos dropping in two days  for the mv or something else  didn t they just start filming the mv ,1,104,19
oh i see  thanks  it s quite interesting to see a guy appearing in bp things,1,76,15
nam joo hyuk  he s a famous south korean actor under yge  ,1,58,11
omg   amp  x200b  by the way  who is this guy  ,1,47,9
oh okay,1,7,2
oh yeah  sorry  i meant to reply to the comment about that it s generally negative ,1,83,15
um i agree with what you are saying tho  i was saying that generally its all positive  ,1,87,17
well yeah  there are negative commemts as well  can t really help that  but at least they re all not negative is what i m trying to say ,1,136,25
yg going to get bankrupt at this rate with all this mediaplay and payola ,1,73,14
i wouldn t bother reading up on it too deep  so much misinformation and toxic behaviour going around  honestly it s cancer to the brain ,1,136,23
yeah i assume all the planning and pre production prep work is already done  i d imagine there will be some off the cuff creative decisions but barring unforeseen circumstances they just need to follow through on what they planned ,1,231,38
dddd comeback was off the hook  like almost a million ppl was watching the countdown livestream they held on vlive  they ve grown so much since then can t imagine what it will be like ,1,184,33
i have been telling everyone seungri s scandal is on him  he did this to himself  if it was done on yg s instruction or during the time he is representing yg then yg holds part of the blame  blaming yg is like if you are a driver for a company and get into an accident during the time outside your working hours  the other parties are seeking damages from the company for your accident  now  if it happens while you are on a business for the company then the company are also responsible ,1,488,92
oh i see    i think they also need to delay it now  but if he said so then it should really be more than a cf,1,109,26
the eskimo person replied to a blink s theory about this collab with applause and thumbs up    [twitter source]   tl dr theory is that blackpink will have their comeback press conference and showcase at paradise city  the tentative date of the album is march 25th so the date coincides with eskimo s count down to their collab   ,1,329,56
swalla dance cover who  i only know collaboration ,1,50,8
 yg is not going to screw themselves  seungri  hold my beer,1,59,11
yeee  it s gonna be a hell of a spring with the comeback and the coachella  a lot of material for us  music videos  live performances and hopefully interviews with ellen or jimmy fallon  they re there so why not   if the single is good they re gonna slay in usa  looking forward to it   ,1,287,53
yes  blackpink is the revolution  yg should go into the dungeon  stop showing your face in public  delete your instagram  concentrate on promoting your artists  the fans shouldn t even be begging for albums instead yg should be begging us to buy them ,1,251,42
really  all the popular comments i saw were  im excited   guess i have to look at the whole comment section,1,107,20
actually they re generally negative  most go along the lines of    \  blackpink probably didn t do anything wrong but its yg  so i m not supporting listening to them  \  oh  the group from the drugstore  yg s nickname  drugs  etc  \  etc  ,1,239,39
that will make much more sense but yes i also doubt that they have enough time to do so,1,87,19
   i guess thats more feasible since they are gonna film the mv this week  welp  i guess they might have fan sign event there at least during their comeback  wait do they even have enough time for that tho ,1,206,40
according to this japan store it will be released on the 25th    ,1,65,12
they got us,1,11,3
i still think that it is only a cf  as we actually know this has been done in february,1,86,19
everyone wants to collab with our girls these days  get them foreign stars ma babies,1,84,15
okay since the comeback is confirmed  i am actually excited to see what this  epic collaboration  is gonna be  im quite sure that it is related to the comeback somehow ,1,168,30
i know right  i was preparing myself to see some shitty comments  but all of them were really positive and excited ,1,115,21
damn you are lucky  enjoy your time there  and hopefully you can go and see them perform and have wins on shows at least once ,1,126,25
it will be released before the american concerts because those who bought the tickets also bought the digital album  if they did not come out with the album it will be fraud and false advertising  so what are you people worrying about  yg is not going to screw themselves  yg usually also will not released any album at the same time as any other artists of their labels  since anda released late feb early march its obvious blackpink not releasing it then  bom and epikhigh releases might also be taken into consideration  ,1,524,91
about time even if it is a mini album i ll take it,1,50,12
their songs  and other kpop group songs  are pretty popular in korean restaurants where i m from  good food  good music ,1,120,20
true but its atleast better than nothing      ,1,46,8
i believe yg is fully aware of the popularity that bp has  since he let them debut in the us and also have a europe tour  but he s just focusing on boosting their already huge presence instead of letting them make actual music,1,226,43
can t even describe how exited i am for this  ,1,46,9
mini album      we deserve a freaking whole album  ,1,51,10
maybe in a couple of years since i think yg is finally starting to notice the impact blackpink has,1,98,19
i hope it happens,1,17,4
omg yes  ,1,9,2
 gt  forever young that s surprising ,1,37,5
hopefully these scandal will make yg change and keep his promises,1,65,11
that    is kinda what happened to me as well  all my friends who were blinks said that i was an ot3 and that i used the mr2 being ruined in the mv as a reason to hate jennie  some people right lol ,1,197,42
that s so funny you say that  when they first released solo and i was watching it on the livestream  there was a shot of the mr2 before they ruined it and i was so excited  then they showed it again with lipstick all over it and i was so upset  i complained about it to all my friends and they couldn t have cared less,1,318,64
stan jennie  lt 3 ,1,18,3
i usually dont watch these kinds if videos since most tend to revolve around the same old  dark sides  to kpop bullet points without providing further discussion or insight to the industry  but this one pretty good ,1,215,37
just throw my body in the river ,1,32,7
other than some minor inaccuracies  it s very well researched ,1,62,9
haha yeah  when you have experience  editing a video is incredibly quick  you just gotta plan things before hand  like    we ask ourselves how we re going to edit this shot  or how we re going to transition from this to this  ,1,226,40
honestly didn t know the turnaround would be that quick  seems like so much work ,1,81,14
maybe someone s driving that mr2 around just like that,1,54,9
she is so versatile in styles  just too good ,1,45,9
will blackpink ever have a proper whole album  seems like not ,1,62,11
on the contrary to your nightmare  i m hoping for a tank to appear in the mv  i only have 3 weaknesses in this world  differential equations  bp  and tanks  when dddd came out  i had to internalize my excitement when the t 34 85 appeared since it was like 2am ,1,260,48
hope they won t ruin another [mr2]   like they did for jennie s solo  had nightmares for   months   after the solo s mv was released  and just made it way less enjoyable knowing a classic was ruined for it  that scene is still haunting me till today    please just let it sit there peacefully if it s in the mv this time ,1,321,58
movie vfx artist  compositor and editor here  if you have a team of people  like 5     it doesn t take long at all  ,1,116,22
first time ever in the line store in nyc last year and aiiyl was on  it was like it was meant to be lol ,1,104,24
what does [it mean]     they wasn t able to sell the tickets  or there will be no concert  ,1,91,18
strangely enough i also hear their songs quite often at grocery stores and recycle shops  nothing like shopping for fresh produce to the beat of d4  i guess ,1,157,28
yes  this is going to be the comeback of the year  i m so hyped ,1,64,14
also nyc  don t think it s count  but i only heard solo   a group of people in my college were playing it loud during the break in cafeteria hallway  ________ also  i ve been to nagoya sushi  and they had bts and momoland on a radio  ,1,234,45
there are distinctions between a media pr ambassador which there are dozens like you say for each region and there are global house ambassador that represents the overall brand  show me the  dozens of brand ambassadors  that made it to the official chanel ig page  so far the only house ambassadors are kristin stewart  pen lope cruz  margot robbie  liu wen  and now jennie kim ,1,378,63
i heard kiss and make up  forever young and solo in bluewater and hear it quite often   bluewater is one of biggest shopping centre  shopping mall in the uk  ,1,158,29
oh  thanks  ,1,12,2
bruh she kinda looks like seulgi in the grey picture  ,1,54,11
house ambassador is just another name for brand ambassador   there are no tiers ,1,80,12
didn t want to specify names  but yea it s a shitshow over there for every bp thread  just a bunch of thinly veiled hate for bp disguised as  concern  for the group ,1,165,31
ros  singing uptown funk reminded of jisoo dancing to it   ,1,59,10
don t forget the 9 song jokes  and the  acoustic version  japanese version  instrumental version  jokes  ,1,105,15
of course or else why would they sign bp,1,40,9
umg and interscope pushed hard  that s my guess ,1,48,8
my body is ready reggie,1,23,4
march of next year ,1,19,4
they re already saying that on  didn t even bother replying to the comments since they re so sold with their narrative that blackpink is comingback to distract the people from the scandal  instead of in spite of it ,1,215,36
you hear solo a lot in shopping stores internationally b c it s distributed by interscope ,1,90,14
nah she s recently got promoted to [house ambassador]   which is like top dog alongside kristin stewart ,1,104,16
she is one of dozens of brand ambassadors for chanel ,1,53,10
uhh you know she s their brand ambassador right  which is a much more prestigious title than muse  ,1,99,17
okay yg representative says the exact comeback date can t be confirmed now which i think is legit   ,1,100,17
 gt  yg confirms  blackpink will be filming their music video this week  but no comeback date announced   gt   we cannot release the exact comeback date yet  but it is true blackpink are filming their music video this week   [source]   so anytime late march to super early april  ,1,280,47
the cover on the left  holy sh t ,1,33,7
their songs are played quite frequently here in clothing shops for young people  japan ,1,87,14
omg   i was giving up on the idea that they will have a comeback at the end of this month  and thinking it would be next month     i was upset because i am happened to be in korea during the end of march   now  i am super duper excited because i will be in korea on blackpink comeback day     only if yg didn t delay the comeback though   woohooo   i am living in japan  so shipping fee is nothing compared to blinks who are in the other half of the world  but just being in korea on their comeback day  and could possibly buy their album  really makes me more excited than ever ,1,579,112
chanel should make jennie a muse already  i doubt anybody has done a better job promoting the brand than she has  ,1,114,21
jennie kim has no chill  ,1,25,5
this really is no big deal and i would hope people don t spread the lazy narrative of yg  rushing things   an mv is mostly planned beforehand  what the concept will be  what props you need  etc  the shoot is fast  it is only 3 4 minutes of material you need  not sure how much extra material there is but it won t be too much  1 2 days of shooting is totally doable  then the editing is a lot of work to make it smooth and perfect  but in the end we only have 4 minutes of film  that doesn t take too many manhours to edit either ,1,530,104
nothing related to blackpink  this is referring to the seungri scandal   i wouldn t know where to begin to summarize but i would search his name on  if you re not familiar with it  there have been many articles and i think a megathread  ,1,237,42
yesss finally   so ready for new bp music  ,1,43,8
jennie kim coming for our necks once again   ,1,45,9
what scandal  did i miss something ,1,35,6
it took 5 days for dddd ,1,24,6
exactly  it would have been a worse decision for him not to  because i bet umg and interscope are pushing for new music before western promotions  also i m sure the girls didn t want to go to coachella with the same songs they have been singing for 3 years  ,1,258,48
i m hype hype hype ,1,19,4
the korean comments in the article seem good so far and some are saying they can t wait as well  so things are looking alright ,1,127,24
yg knows this of course  clearer than everyone of us  but he still has to do so or else he will put himself into greater troubles  but i agree that the timing is really shitty for all these shits,1,195,39
yep  i try to see how many kpop songs i can hear during floor routines xd,1,73,16
r kpop is saying what i knew was going to be said  non blackpink fans stating that this is a yg distraction from the scandal  but they don t know that this have been planned for like a month now  ,1,196,38
halsey [liked]   her picture ,1,29,4
they shouldn t just warn  they should go ahead and sue the living cra\  out of them  and hopefully  they ll learn ,1,114,20
i feel like they are going to come in hard  we will be knocked to the group and will need lifeline because we won t be able to get up ,1,134,29
cool  are ya gymnastics fan too   ,1,34,7
this is my 2nd and if it is anything like the first  oh man  lt 3 watching that vlive countdown with the 4 girls  the dddd mv for the first time  i actually almost cried lol  prepare to be really happy  d,1,204,41
i think this is just a deal that they have with this company  i don t think is necessarily related to the comeback  ,1,116,22
you rly overestimate how long a music video takes ,1,50,9
regions outside south korea should have less impact  but not for south korea  the scandal thing is really huge for south korea and therefore the backlash aroused and yge artists were even ordered to have a social blackout last week,1,231,40
bae is just on another level ,1,29,6
me too  i think this time yg is acting like  put all one s eggs in one basket   because it is very sure that there would be backlash in south korea  but still internationally hyped ,1,181,34
of course the scandals could impact it  it s not illogical to think that an ongoing scandal could potentially sour the excitement and reception for a comeback and it s not a stretch to believe a company would wait until the storm has blown over to release new material  in fact i already see people claiming yg is only releasing the comeback news now to divert people s attention from the scandals going on  but these people forgot or don t know yg announced the comeback time period way back before all this shit   ,1,516,90

enjoy it  my first comeback was d4 and i couldn t sleep all night ,1,66,13
d4 did that too  was shot like a week before the date  ,1,55,12
i honestly thought they were going to delay the date of the comeback more because of that  but i guess they know they need them,1,127,25
same  was so worried yg s mess was going to ruin my very first ult bias group comeback  ,1,88,17
they were like headless chickens running around to be honest    hanging on to every rumor  relax and enjoy life  you guys and gals  don t be stressing too much  ,1,161,29
filming m vs only takes one or two days at most  editing takes longer but 2 weeks isn t that crazy  ,1,100,19
next week  lol the contract obligation is real then ,1,52,9
can t believe people  honestly  thought that the scandal would impact the album being released  the album was probably already finished a month or two go  ,1,155,25
yo la we re gonna get the first taste of the new choreos  we ll have two weeks to phonetically learn all the lyrics  ,1,117,22
lol yge stock prices rose,1,25,5
 gt  based on yahoo japan s cd online store  blackpink s new ep album will have 2 versions and is set to be released on 25 march 2019 [source]  ,1,144,27
yesss i cant wait ,1,18,4
assuming preproduction is done well  it s not too crazy ,1,56,9
yes especially because of the recent shits ,1,43,7
finally and thanks for the update  ,1,35,6
i mentioned to someone else in this thread when i was looking through his ig i saw a pic of him with one of the nct units  dream i think it was and it looked like they did a performance there  i can t be for sure but that s what it looked like to me anyways  so maybe that s why he has connections is people perform there  ,1,323,66
she s glowing,1,13,2
i was peeping at his ig too recently with this whole collab thing going on and saw in one of his pics he was with one of the nct units  dream i think  and they did a show  it looked like it was at their hq but i can t be sure since i saw the pic a little bit ago  ,1,264,60
she looks so pretty  i love that dress  there s that bear again   ,1,66,12
can t wait  i was wondering if it was going to be that and i m glad they re still having a comeback  i m so looking forward to it and then coachella and the north american tour  i m just disappointed it s a mini album     but i m happy for new songs ,1,250,46
can t wait   wish can skip ahead of time and hear their new songs right away  ,1,78,16
finally   it seems like we have been waiting for years for this,1,63,12
i can t breathe i can already feel the epicness of this comeback you guys   ,1,76,14
    it s the 18th now  they re gonna have an entire mv recorded and edited in less than two weeks ,1,98,19
y e s     let s get it     ,1,27,10
i ve heard kiss and make up several times here around in toronto  canada     most of the time it s in restaurants  non korean restaurants  ,1,139,23
i am so ready  pls give us more information though  how many songs will be on the ep  pls give us 6  pls give us 6  pls give us 6  d teasers pls  anything  anyway  it s about time and i couldn t be more excited,1,210,44
time to finally take off our   costumes yall     this is my first blackpink comeback  i m so excited      ,1,106,19
i m not ready  the group s following has grown so much since dddd that this comeback is going to be epic ,1,105,20
thanks for clarifying  ,1,23,3
this is just analyst predictions from a financial company  it s not yg s words ,1,79,13
okay naver even posted an article  in korean  mentioning that bp is gonna comeback in the end of march  ,1,104,19
they will be shooting the m v later this week ,1,46,9
bitch yes,1,9,2
thanks for clarifying     ,1,26,4
just checked twitter and now a lot of sources are saying the comeback is confirmed for end of march,1,99,19
yeah  i think they will definitely continue the tour since they have contractual obligations etc  i just hope the girls get to perform without worrying too much about how the international blinks would respond to the issue  i mean look at how happy they were during the asia tour  they were glowing though you can see they were tired at some point but the girls were happy af ,1,376,68
totally agree  quite a good plan to start off the comeback together with the americas and europe tour  more international fans and they get to fulfill their  contractual obligation  with interscope while waiting for the seungri scandal to cool down a bit in sk  but i really think they need to address this matter asap  esp for our korean blink friends    what if they get less promotions in sk  i noticed they do variety shows etc for song promotions and or comebacks  ,1,470,82
i hope so too  i wish we had better  legit  sources but i just posted it because i thought someone from the community can clarify  nevertheless  i guess we shall wait and see  but the most important thing is that the girls are okay and they are posting on ig again  ,1,266,51
as long as blackpink s world tour continues as planned  i will be happy  hopefully a comeback plus your right after isn t too taxing on them though  ,1,149,26
i guess we ll just wait a little bit more  i m happy the girls are posting on ig again  ,1,88,18
i was hoping for a march 29th comeback but an april 5th comeback seems more realistic  there s a ton of groups coming back in april but i guess that s how just it is  i also saw this earlier  a financial report predicting the expected performance of the different entertainment companies  they had other companies listed too and other stuff not here like how bigbang is going to go on a dome tour when they come back from the military among other stuff   amp  x200b ,1,466,83
oooooh id love to hear that  do you have a link ,1,48,11
this is very interesting  thanks for posting it  early april seems likely at this point then  minimal south korean promotion  trying to gain more fans in america  also to increase money made from say youtube because cpm is higher there  last part is also interesting  more comebacks  2 per year to give people a little more content and build stronger fanbases  seems solid  ,1,374,63
i think source is important for yg thing and i hope this is something updated by yg  he needs to address these matters ,1,119,23
adventure club played bp in their set last week ,1,48,9
the bottom of the toy handle is flared like a trumpet bell just saying,1,70,14
so basically focus on north america promotions  april comeback  rosie solo after tour  at least two comebacks a year from now on ,1,129,22
same  heard solo at starbucks in toronto,1,40,7
basically what i think the current management should do  vote out the controversial figure in the form of yang hyun suk  amp  appoint someone else who can handle the business properly  with this fresh new start  yge can then start planning  amp  executing its recovery plan ,1,274,46
they ve played boombayah  solo  and ddu du ddu du at a club here in texas  they ve also played baam by momoland lol,1,115,22
idk i posted a similar thread yesterday with a link to an article regarding to yg being sued  amp  it was locked within an hour plus ,1,133,26
i actually posted similar thread yesterday abt this  and within an hour or two my post was locked  amp  it was downvoted  i messaged the mods inquiring why it was locked  amp  still hasn t received any reply from them  i think your post fare better since it s still around with  9 net upvote  not sure why the different treatment tho  maybe it s cos of i was a bit firm  amp  seen as aggresive in my phrasing wording ,1,417,76
blackpink is the revolution  ,1,29,5
kiss and make up has played in my gym several times  at least 4 or 5 that i can recall  i live in karlstad sweden  the fact that this happened was so cool because my real life is so secluded from kpop  ,1,202,42
yg is bigger than seungri  yg is not unfamilliar with scandals  they ll do fine  if its other labels whose got only pne succesful act than it ll be worrisome ,1,158,28
i heard kiss and makeup the other day at a mac  makeup store  in the bahamas  i was so excited lol,1,98,21
i m up in seattle  so far i ve heard  solo  being played on tv during the seahawks game  blackpink s entire  square up  discography was played in a night market up in vancouver  i ve heard  solo  in starbucks too  ,1,214,37
i heard forever young at a japanese restaurant and a korean bbq place in the phoenix area ,1,90,17
i only heard kiss and make up  and was in a chinesse shop in spain  ,1,68,16
kiss  amp  make up at the spin studio i go to  ,1,47,11
what s the song at 4 50 minutes  ,1,33,7
i heard solo playing at starbucks while i was waiting for my drink    ,1,70,14
i agree there is some major mismanagement going on  bp should defiantly have more music  though i will say while i know yg for sure wants to push into the american  i think this over the top push has be brought about by the interscope deal  which i believe interscope approached yg  i also think that the coachella invitation was why they ended up playing venues that are to big for where they are in their development  as for the announcement of the tour being sold out  it is technically sold out unfortunately is the resale market that is making it look like its not  whether yg had something to to with the scalpers buying up tickets i have no idea but i know that ticketmaster has long be accused of having deals with scalpers  may be wrong about all this  hopefully it all works out in the end ,1,800,149
i heard boombayah and whistle at korean restuarants in the states ,1,66,11
kiss and make up isn t their song so it makes a little more sense that it was playing in the us  i still haven t heard any of their song being played where i live but in la i heard solo a few times  ,1,199,43
i ve heard both whistle and boombayah used as music in floor routines in ncaa women s gymnastics  ,1,98,16
damn this girl is supermodel material ,1,38,6
i still can t believe they used that crusty ass photoshop edit for the official youtube audio,1,93,16
i don t think that s as valid a comparison since kpop netizens put so much more weight on an artist s parent company than the west do  most fans wouldn t be able to name the label record megapopstars like taylor swift or selena gomez are signed to nor the ceos heading those companies  but in the k entertainment industry  company background is a huge part of artist discussions  kpop fans can match korean artists to their respective companies without skipping a beat meanwhile if you ask american fans who the  big 3  in america are  the vast majority of them wouldn t be able to answer that  also it s come to the point that yg himself is getting sued as well as being exposed for tax evasion so it s no longer just a lone act under the company committing atrocities  ,1,771,136
ive heard kiss and make up in forever 21  ,1,42,9
no  rca s stock did not drop 14   yg s did ,1,43,9
not sure about that i live in romania and this is the first kpop song to make it on the radio its been played like crazy this summer and is still quite popular,1,159,33
kiss and make up is a big hit in finland  i have heard it a lot everywhere  on radio  at malls  in bars etc ,1,108,24
i didn t hear it personally  but i remember a girl posting a video of d4  or solo  i really can t recall  playing in some mall  which is pretty great  ,1,151,29
which is absolutely bs    why would you hate them   i think these people hating are just antis that can take advantage of the situation  but if someone is genuinely hating on any yg artists not related to this scandal  they got some serious problems,1,249,45
if i had to guess its getting deleted because it doesn t directly involve bp  it s also bringing out the worst in kpop fans in other parts of the internet  ,1,156,29
 gt  if yg falls bp could turn to teddy  black label   interscope or p nation  they would most likely be owned by interscope if yg fell imagine bp with interscope  that would be the revolution  ,1,194,35
i completely agree with everything you said  to be completely honest i could see yg being forced out if things don t improve  its weird to think of yge without yg but i think all of the hate that yg artist get is as a result of the hatred for yg himself  which is ridiculous to think that people wish for the failure of artists because of one man  i actually believe that fresh management may be a good thing though  ,1,417,80
can we talk about the giant mismanagement from yg  claiming a sold out tour  not putting out more songs in 3 years after debut and trying to push for the na market  the girls are getting torn up right now because of this  i feel bad ,1,233,46
i think they are being deleted because it s just people panicking with no evidence to show that bp is being to affected by it  no shows cancelled or anything  and this is mainly a sub for bp not yg ,1,198,39
yg as a company will not close down  as a publicly traded company it does not matter if yg the man is removed or faces an asset forfeiture  yg the company has its own money from investors and the board of governors will select a new ceo if yg the man decides is forced to step down  as the main yg act at the moment  new management would more than likely push more bp content image music in order to recoup loss of revenue that the scandals will bring  with seungri s scandal it is unlikely big bang as a whole will see a comeback  but solo careers from gd and taeyang will definitely still happen once they are discharged  the company will not be closing down due to personal scandals  even those affecting the ceo or one of the largest acts  see examples  papa john s  tesla  microsoft  amazon  ,1,797,145
help a sister out  selling 3 blink vip tickets for  300 each  i bought 4 thinking my sisters will come with me  unfortunately they changed their mind after another world tour was announced    [pics]   ,1,201,35
if yg falls bp could turn to teddy  black label   interscope or p nation  they would most likely be owned by interscope if yg fell tho  so that could later result in even bigger international projects and stuff  however  considering bp s insane popularity and their popular label mates  bigbang ot4  ikon  winner   i dont think yg falling is something that would happen  worst case scenario  yg goes down  bp disbands splits up  brand falls with them and the girls get left on their own  ,1,488,83
i also find the need to add   let s not forget how huge the blink fandom is  how much of a following the girls have  they re huge stars already  even if the korean public reacts badly to them in the beginning  which they most likely will  they also have a huge international fanbase  they can sail through this  they have huge endorsements and also american labels to support them as well  this might be a rough patch for the girls but they will definitely come out stronger  they ll have even stronger motivation towards their music this time and i honestly cannot wait to see them back on stage ,1,597,108
adding to this  i just think that since they ve already released a statement that they plan on doing better in managing their artists and also the yg shareholders taking action  we can really hope for some actual improvement in management schedules releases etc  despite the bad press and an obvious decrease in value for the yg brand name  what i m trying to say is  it could be a bad stretch for yg as a company  but it could mean better things for the artists  let us just continue to support them and hope for the best ,1,523,94
even if yg end goes into any real trouble  i think there can be a way to manage their current artists in their subsidiary label   black label  worst case scenario is there s a major reshuffle in management and losses but i don t think they will abandon the artists  nor is the company itself going to vanish  ,1,309,57
i think its an important matter     why do they delete them   s i really like blackpink and i already hate that yg havent gave them what they deserve and now i dont want them to lose what they achived,1,200,39
ppl already is hating yg artists  so i think there is already a concern   ,1,74,14
he seems like a genuine kpop fan leaning towards the hardcore end  rare to see that from older  professional  corporate folks  it s dope ,1,137,23
it seems like every other day this is posted here  has the r  kelly scandal taken down rca sony or label mates pink  justin timberlake  or alecia keyes ,1,152,27
jennie is so photogenic hot damn   ,1,35,7
i think this post will be deleted very soon lol because it seems that we can t discuss the scandal and yg thing here  there were many deleted threads which are also revolving around yg  amp  bp   but as you can see as threads on similar topics  questions and discussion keep being posted by blinks  this should be something that many are concerned as after all bp is a yge group and how bp will go is really related to yg himself ,1,430,81
andrew oh is the chief of future strategic planning of the paradise group h q   a big resort corporation  but i don t know why he has so many connections with k entertainment industry too  he actually had taken many photos with bp and many other famous kpop groups or korean artists  i think he should also know yg very well ,1,325,58
international queens  i think that this collab really brought more western audiences to bp which is so amazing  completely deserved  this song is a total bop ,1,158,26
there are no real relations to seungri s scandal other than seungri being part of the label  not anymore btw   i guess he is still ceo of ygx  i cannot find anything about that  assuming yge would go down  which they probably won t  unless they are majorly connected to this big scandal which is way bigger than kpop btw  this is about politicians and conglomerates most likely  the kpop idols going down atm are tiny fish and scapegoats  then blackpink would probably simply not exist anymore  unless some other company buys all the rights to the brand and the girls all sign there as well  not sure how likely that would be  but it s ridiculous to even worry about something like that atm  there is no immediate danger of that happening anytime soon  not sure what your point about the parents is  blackpink has no connection to any of this as far as i am aware ,1,864,155
just peeped his ig  who is this andrew fella and how is he so connected to the k entertainment industry  ,1,105,20
it s ok  lisa soon to be  1 in the west  maybe  2 but only after the english language connoisseur and linguistics professor roseanne park  ,1,139,24
i see some common drawing mistakes  bottom of the toy handle doesn t line up correctly  anatomy issues with the ears and fingers  wrinkles of the jacket are odd  there are other things that catch my eye but i don t think the artist will even see this comment ,1,259,47
i think this also proves that bp is really an internationally recognised group ,1,79,12
this song got 0 promotion and it has 100million views  that shows the power of blackpink fans  ,1,95,17
i am just happy that they are allowed to post again  if there actually was a ban  which seems extremely likely   now i really hope that there will be teasers tomorrow  the time window for a comeback before coachella is closing but it is still definitely possible  would mean limited promotion in korea though  but that as pretty much always a given with the intended late march comeback ,1,387,68
i m going to safely assume you re not korean  or brainwashed living elsewhere  don t make such generalized statements  especially ones that are just plain wrong  ,1,162,24
you know ig ban has been lifted when even lisa spams photos    waiting on jisoo now   ,1,86,18
i agree completely  i think that intercope and umg are expecting new music for western promotions and yge may even be contractually obligated to release this ep  i m just speculating of course  who knows  i m trying not to get my hopes up but i m just excited  ,1,261,46
let s wait for jisoo s instagram updates ,1,41,6
they had to censor jennie s airpods in the opening scene    gotta have the girls secure their bag with samsung  can t wait for rosie and lisa s pool date in episode 4  ,1,168,31
lol audio only   the power  ,1,28,4
yay they re back ,1,17,3
[source  1]   [source  2]   [source  3]  ,1,41,6
perhaps its the english speaking blinks who aren t able to connect to the sole member of blackpink who doesn t speak english ,1,125,21
you re getting my hopes up  i don t want to say this but   i think they ll drop a teaser soon  just a feeling  gahhhhh ,1,119,24
totally spies anyone ,1,21,3
what a cutie  also this is one of my favourite looks on her ,1,60,13
um sis this aint it  you are generalizing koreans and thats really offensive to the korean lisa stans and to just anyone  stop with that toxic attitude  and no  i truly believe jisoo s personality is one of the main reasons why korea loves her ,1,244,44
 make a music video already  ,1,29,5
rosie is alive     ugh she s so cute  wonder if she changed her hair if she s posting a throwback    ,1,101,20
there are two story updates ,1,28,5
absolutely  it always has reggae vibes but this version is just incredible  o overall my favorite song of theirs maybe  though dddd and whistle are up there as well for me ,1,172,31
i m so glad they re back posting again  i was getting worried ,1,62,11
omg it is so good to see new content  i hope this means potential teasers for a comeback soon as well  lt 3 really is also probably my favorite song of their latest ep at this moment  it just sounds so good and produces the best live performances because there is no strict choreo  ,1,282,53
rose just updated stories as well,1,33,6
i feel like the earth has tilted back on its axis now  ,1,55,12
but i really can t think of other possible collaborations lol,1,61,10
so  basically blackpink is  1 for january  february and march  and so is jennie  and jisoo in top 10 this past 3 months too  just wow ,1,134,26
this is a lot of hype for a cf  there s got to be more to it,1,60,16
please just stop ,1,17,3
a cf   they filmed it like 1 5 months ago at the hotel,1,54,11
i guess the scandal is spreading out to other companies  so yg isn t the only one under the mircoscope  time to let the girls shine ,1,132,25
i think it should be a new cf for the hotel,1,43,11
damn jennie  what a babe,1,24,5
i have literally no idea what to expect    the hints  it doesn t ring a bell to me  maybe because i m a new blink  does this mean a new song  or just a new promotion for the hotel  ,1,181,38
online was cheaper than when they were here in malaysia  ,1,57,10
  ep  5,1,7,2
i had to mute the video during the asmr part  i m sorry jisoo but i hate slurping sound     ,1,92,19
i keep seeing that date as the comeback date everywhere  im so confused,1,71,13
my heart stopped i thought it was a cb teaser for a moment lol,1,62,14
apparently andrew oh  eskimo7474 himself lol ,1,45,6
so i think this photo and the one with jisoo are the same and there is someone in the middle  so who can it be ,1,111,25
there should be laws against being this beautiful and that outfit is killer ,1,76,13
wow  rose looks lovely ,1,23,4
it s funny because i heard a rumour a couple of weeks back that the 29th would be the comeback  not sure were i saw it  ,1,120,25
she should also have a great thirst in updating social network    three posts in a row ,1,87,16
it s just too many of them ,1,27,6
your optimism shall prevail  hands down ,1,40,6
it happens to be the day that lisa surpassed blackpink official account followers on instagram  lol,1,99,16
yes blackout over  looks for a comeback might be coming on the 29th  look for teaser on monday or sooner ,1,105,20
okay we are back to the usual social bp programming now ,1,56,11
total   12 photos  [source 1]   \  caption     sssssunjae [source 2]   \  caption  concertvibe [source 3]   \  caption   never forget these moments  ,1,149,22
what a cutie  ,1,14,4
these instagram posts represents a glimmer of hope  this is a good sign so hopefully we hear something this week but won t get my hopes up cause don t want to get  ,1,164,32
seems their sns ban is over  finally  and that outfit  jennie    ,1,65,12
blackout defiantly over jennies posting on ig,1,45,7
what an absolute stunner  she s killing me in that dress  8 days until what ever this is drops  so that s a week on monday  the 25th  i wonder if there will be any more hints  i imagine they will show some group shots next,1,222,44
this episode gave me so much life  i love to see them smile  also   how about rehearsal vocals they killed it  low key message for haters who say they can t sing      ,1,167,32
i agree and i think yg did it that way to somehow try to protect our girls from hateful comments or thats what i want to believe  ,1,130,27
rip lisa ,1,9,2
so beautiful i love it   ,1,25,6
i think you may be on to something  only time will tell ,1,56,12
r tee and anda also promoted and did a radio appearance so looks like it ,1,73,14
nearly every bp videos got frozen view problem  i think it s because of the crazy views skyrocketing in a very short period of time that youtube can t even handle it lol  i can t even imagine the comeback things  it will be beyond crazy   amp  x200b  as for the blackout  i think it is really a blackout  and in fact everyone  including many blinks  would like to see that jerk falls down haha,1,393,71
this blackout is dumb and overblown  the views are frozen atm lol ,1,66,12
i think this also proves that the social blackout should be lifted  they should upload the 200m views poster for 4d dance practice videos and things like that lol,1,162,29
nah yous shouldn t generalize koreans like  not all of them are like that   ,1,76,13
yeah i think it s nayeon  sana  and tzuyu who are currently the most popular in twice when it comes to korea  maybe i should say koreans don t connect with south east asian idols ,1,179,33
i guess the social media ban is now lifted and we re back to our regular programming  i missed my babygirls so bad  ,1,116,23
is there a list of bp   wwcy subbed episodes  cant seem to find them anywhere and thanks for this episode ,1,106,21
are not sana really popular in korea tho ,1,41,8
i m not sure koreans care all that much about personality though  everything is all about looks and nationality in that country   amp  x200b ,1,141,22
clownnation lets risee,1,22,3
an album of all the concert live versions ,1,42,8
yes omg ,1,8,2
ooh good observation  ,1,22,3
to be honest  jisoo s looks is not the only thing koreans love her for  they also love her personality and how she treats everyone with kindness ,1,145,26
because jisoo has the protypical look that koreans prefer   like irene ,1,71,10
i just realized i need the reggae version for really to be released ,1,68,13
oh my holy god it shows hong kong concert            ,1,53,11
the intro song sounds different from the previous episodes where they put their own songs  maybe is a hint to their comeback  ,1,126,23
400k views in under an hour  the thirst is real ,1,48,10
jennie asking lisa to go through the 16 shots dance moves is the cutest thing ever ma babies,1,92,18
jisoo almost murdered my ears with that loud slurping during the asmr  but what can i say  the whole asmr was truly a blessing,1,126,24
ikr  she barely gets any jobs smh and korea just love her  as for lisa i m not expecting her to be top 10 but 42   i m starting to think koreans just don t really connect with foreign idols ,1,190,36
lol how does jisoo have such high spots every single month  when all she does is breathe  korea really is in love with her,1,122,24
their 16 shots dance is their sexiest most badass performance yet  i d die too  that part in the middle of the dance when all the backup dancers stand down and the spotlight shines on just the four girls as they half dance half catwalk down the stage  phew ,1,257,47
cool  we get a free really rehearsal vid as well,1,48,10
i almost had a heart attack thinking this was some comeback teaser ,1,67,12
how do you check these statistics ,1,34,6
this is good timing telling blinks to not worry so much ,1,56,11
thank god they posted something   ,1,34,6
also  imagine blackpink with a concept like 16 shots  i d die ,1,62,11
i need more   these videos end so soon or i m just really greedy     ,1,69,14

i agree  and people need to stop being too sensitive and always finding fault in critical statements  no one here means to offend  we see that lisa and rose might be underweight  and express our concern  no need to label that as  body shaming   ,1,245,44
you are kind  amp  generous for wanting to give your sister such a fun  amazing experience  kudos to you for such a giving spirit  fwiw  you might be able to sell them  you could always try and then if it doesn t work out for the price you want originally paid  just keep them  go anyway  amp  enjoy every moment of it  but honestly  you never know  if someone wants to go badly enough  they will pay it  just from my own experience  i saw taylor swift s 1989 tour but had to buy tickets resale after it was already sold out  i couldn t afford tickets when they went on sale originally  at christmas time  thanks t swift    so by the time i could  people were re selling them for way more than what they were originally worth because of demand  but she was fabulous and it was worth it  so maybe ,1,796,147
what do you mean by production lacking compared to 2ne1 stages  ,1,64,11
i just want to say that i don t know enough about the complicated nature of the ongoing scandals to understand if or how it will affect blackpink  but i am 100  here for these girls and i hope they do not become collateral damage  they are too talented  hard working and all around wonderful people to be caught up in someone else s horrific mistakes  so  whether it s appropriate or not for them to comeback soon or whether they will or won t be able to because of the scandals  i won t claim to understand    i am 100  here for them no matter what  however long it takes  lt 3 in the meantime  i finally had the opportunity to order their official lightstick and welcoming kit  so i m excited for my first bp merch ,1,717,129
ughh well played yge,1,20,4
 gt  ah i forgot many ppl here don t really visit other sites threads other than this sub reddit  amp  many are probably newer fans who don t speak korean  considering the most recent promotion of bp to the us  no i am informed through korean sources actually  if you want to actually give evidence give evidence and cut the rhetorics  that won t work here   gt  i don t really wanna talk about stock since i think it s irrelevant  in short  stock prices rise  amp  fall all the time  it s not even a  correct   in its literal sense  valuation of a company since it s basically based on demand supply  i can elaborate on this if you want   this really has nothing to do with stock and other yge s financial state  for what its worth  though  investors are pulling out their money from yge  the total withdrawal was around  100 million  krw 55 3 billion   big yikes either way  you literally did so in the op  so i expanded on it  losing investors is bad  but as far as i am aware some of these claims are not even validated  lvmh for example has the option to opt out until later this year   gt  and no  these wrathful ppl are not only your regular bp haters  though they definitely are over the moon wetting themselves rn  regular citizens are also angry  seungri  yge  amp  yang hyun suk are all related since seungri is made a ceo of yge s subsidiary  they are business partners  it s really hard to disentangle that relationship in front of the public  i d say this is the reason why ppl are also raging towards yge  amp  yang hyun suk  not bp haters  yg haters in general  well yes the only connection is through seungri  him being ceo of the subsidary or not  there is no real connection between the actual scandal and yge  there could be  but so far it is all seungri  i am not denying that some people will guilt yg or other acts under yg for what seungri did or did not do  but i don t think this is representative  i have some faith in common sense  ,1,1960,356
i love this   thank you     ,1,28,6
you mean i am being a centrist ,1,31,7
your phrasing is familiar  this is the kind of statement structure that political trolls use here and on facebook   i m sure that  good   but  bad    cushioning  then casting doubt  but instead of being a russian troll  you are pro jyp  anti yg  interesting  you have dedicated your life to this   ,1,298,49
well i m sure yge can bounce back once the scandal clears up and maybe yang hyun suk voted out as someone who has a say in the company  some  100 million have alrdy been pulled out of the company tho  if yge is to survive with new management team and a new start  i m sure investors are gonna come swarming in to get a piece of their pie ,1,338,68
i think you are overreacting  companies have bad news all the time but investors are the same the world over  if someone is dumb enough to bail out on a fundamentally sound company  they are sitting on a proven goldmine in bp  others will happily jump in to profit off them  sk is no different ,1,294,55
ah i forgot many ppl here don t really visit other sites threads other than this sub reddit  amp  many are probably newer fans who don t speak korean  considering the most recent promotion of bp to the us  i don t really wanna talk about stock since i think it s irrelevant  in short  stock prices rise  amp  fall all the time  it s not even a  correct   in its literal sense  valuation of a company since it s basically based on demand supply  i can elaborate on this if you want   this really has nothing to do with stock and other yge s financial state  for what its worth  though  investors are pulling out their money from yge  the total withdrawal was around  100 million  krw 55 3 billion   big yikes either way  and no  these wrathful ppl are not only your regular bp haters  though they definitely are over the moon wetting themselves rn  regular citizens  are  also angry  seungri  yge  amp  yang hyun suk are all related since seungri is made a ceo of yge s subsidiary  they are business partners  it s really hard to disentangle that relationship in front of the public  i d say this is the reason why ppl are  als  raging towards yge  amp  yang hyun suk  ,1,1168,203
afaik he owns some   of shares but definitely not the majority so i m sure he can be voted out  yge has various institutional investors that make up its majority ownership overall  excluding retail investors ,1,208,35
i think a diplo x blackpink track would be out of this world ,1,61,13
if he is found guilty for these charges the investors will force him out of the company  unless he owns more then 50  of the company he won t have much of a say in this   unless korean laws protect against this ,1,211,41
 gt  and no  i m not buying the counter argument of saying that it s just an over dramatization on my part and ppl are still gonna listen to bp s songs once they comeback  that means it s either  a  you re delusional b  you aren t cognizant enough of how big of a scandal it is and or underestimating the anger from the public it garnered  if you don t agree with my statement which have no actual evidence then you are simply wrong   nice one there  yg s stock isn t even at the lowest point it ever was  ofc it is a problem atm and they would rather not deal with it  but yge isn t even really connected to any of the seungri stuff as far as i am aware  other than the tax evasion which happens all the time and usually gets dealed with with fines  there is mostly directed hate at yg for basically nothing  haters jump on it online  the same people who also jumped on other scandals before  this isn t representative  calling for other agencies to buyout bp is honestly laughable  if you like it or not but bp is what they are because they are part of yge on top of being the girls we all love  teddy alone is a huge reason why  also something people never actually keep in mind  bp are a girlgroup and we deal with things which have mostly women as victims  if anything the male yg groups would get hate at this point  additional one  ,1,1339,249
tbh this is one of the most ideal closure for the whole mess  i hope that since yang hyun suk is being sued  he will finally be forced to step down  amp  someone much more competent takes charge of yge  the onus is still on yge  post yang hyun suk replaced  to gain trust from the public back  amp  to build its image back  that the  new  yge is truly reborn as well as leaving behind all of its shady dealings ,1,411,80
people who like black pink will still like black pink  people who hate black pink will still hate it   it won t be that much of an impact on the black pink brand  and for the company this will most likely mean yg will leave the company someone else will run it appointed by the board and that will be it  and at most this scandal will only remain as long as there are trails   after the trails are done people won t talk about it anymore ,1,438,87
idk maybe change your mindset to be prospective a little bit instead of being retrospective this time  what i m concerned is after the fact  mate ,1,146,25
bp have the  1 3 5 most viewed kpop videos this week on yt peoplle are gonna listen still you are over reacting ,1,112,21
yikes it was a typo  yg the person got sued while yg the company suffers massive losses with investments money  capital  being pulled out of the company ,1,153,27
yge  not yg himself  ,1,21,4
i mean  i m not saying a totally binary statement  i m sure some ppl are still gonna listen to bp but a lot of ppl  as in the general public not only kpop fans  are really rattled with what s going on  i d say it s gonna put quite a bit of a dent to bp since they re associated with yge as one of its groups  and personally  don t you at least feel some sort of repulsion after knowing what yge  amp  seungri are engaging in  i m frankly surprised you say ppl in the us would be indifferent ,1,491,95
wtf i just listened to this     my impact ,1,42,8
is korea like that  like if something like that happened in the us  i feel like people would still listen to whatever the label puts out  is it not like that in korea   0,1,170,34
what s your source ,1,19,3
not surprised  solo is an absolute banger    ,1,45,8
stan jennie  lt 3,1,17,3
this testifies the appeal of bp to the western  to think that philippines is the only asian country in the top 20 streamers is spotify  1  66   ,1,144,27
can he just hurry up and get it over with already  the fans are already in constant panic mode  tbh  the company has lost its focus  all this side ventures into food bars mixnine are just a waste of money when he should have been focusing on music and his artists  i already noticed it during blackpink stages  same thing with winner and ikon   the production is seriously lacking as compared to bigbang 2ne1 stages before ,1,423,73
queen jennie  lt 3 congrats to her  what a legend ,1,50,9
so did chungha  but i aint mad  im glad jennie and bp are having success,1,72,15
summit deserved this ,1,21,3
not gonna lie  i would love to see a collab just because they are the two of the biggest girlbands out there  but i think it s better for them to collab with a dj or something ,1,176,36
jennie also hit 14m on instagram which is dope  these queens are here to conquer ,1,81,15
i still bump to this  while being on the lighter side of yg tracks  it hits the right balance between hip hop and and kpop that i fck with  ,1,140,29

little shir,1,11,2
why wouldn t they be doing fine though  what happened to them ,1,62,11
yea  sadly although i m certain that she updated  i don t have a screenshot of it as a proof  so okay  i declare defeat    ,1,123,24
well it was actually from the blink kit and considering the mod removed your post for that reason and because it wasn t actually from ch    there s your proof ,1,159,27
okay then  as i wasn t able to take a screenshot of this ch  update that she did  if you can share a twitter link to a post wherein you saw this photo  i ll tell everyone that i was lying and will delete this afterwards ,1,220,44
hwi param  uuuggggghhhhhh ,1,26,3
i mean it s not  i know for a fact it s not because i saw it on twitter weeks ago  i don t know what you get from lying to people but alright lol,1,145,32
jisoo posted this photo on vlive ch  but deleted it after a while  most likely just sneaking in to let us know they re doing fine  or at least maybe that s what they wanted to show us  but i really hope they re a okay ,1,218,42
this is definitely from ch   she posted it and then deleted it after a while ,1,77,15
someone want to fill me in on what s happening  this popped up on the front page and am confused af  ,1,101,20
we were played again ,1,21,4
this picture is definitely not from ch  idk why this person is lying  jisoo hasn t updated  i think it s from their welcoming collection  ,1,138,23
i totally get the seriousness of what yge as a whole is having to deal with and i m not expecting everyone to be on the socials pretending like nothing has happened  i m sure there have been hundreds of meetings with investors and board members trying to put out the blaze of a shit storm their in  the problem i have with it is when your a forward facing company  i don t think you can just blackout  while investors and shareholders are super important  the people who buy products are also important  the complete blackout helps none of the uncertainty  honestly as much as i want the comeback  i really just want some information from yg about whats happening with the company as a whole  not just bp but all the artists  while i know he doesn t owe us this information  i feel its important for him to inform everyone of the situation  another big problem is that i have a feeling that interscope and umg are expecting new music for the promotion in the west  there is also that to contend with   amp  x200b ,1,1013,183
but even she looks worried  she still looks stunning omg,1,56,10
you should go   the tixs are getting cheaper by the minute  i recommend using stubhub  the high row tix are about  38 us  which is pretty cheap compared to when buying the tix when they were first released  they were hella expencive  like 100 us for bad view tixs ,1,264,49
she does  im sure this whole situation has put a ton of stress anxiety on them   ,1,81,16
i really hope they all are  she looks worried in this photo though ,1,67,13
visual goddess    glad we got some kind of reassurance that she theyre okay ,1,76,13
sorry  i might have misunderstood what you said  what yg is currently dealing with is something huge and serious  i believe it s just right that there should be a total social media blackout for their artists and no matter how much we might want blackpink to have a comeback this month  we shouldn t demand for it as it surely will affect their promotions  etc  as with anda  as shitty as it may seem to be  considering she s their new artist and she already has debuted  it might be yg s only way to test the waters  but he really shouldn t risk it imo ,1,554,102
i agree that 2 gg groups is way to much  honestly though for me if we re talking solo artist  i d much prefer a rapper  i would absolutely love for them to do a track with kendrick lemar  not sure it would ever happen  if i m being honest thought i m just ready for some new music  i ll take what i can get at this point  ,1,322,64
i ve never been happier or more relieved because of a selfie  queen is alright and thinking of us ,1,98,18
oh yeah i know the anda post is still there  i meant the update from jisoo was deleted my bad  maybe their just testing the water with anda to see if there is any backlash  i may be talking crazy because that would be a shitty thing to do but untill yg updates everyone  none of us know anything  thanks for letting me know,1,323,64
not a thing lol,1,15,4
it s a bit odd though  don t they usually ride around with a member of management  assuming shes in a car  i may be wrong  surely if she was live chatting she d have been pulled up before doing it  obviously i m assuming this is picture is from ch  and if that the case she doesn t look her normal happy self  i may be talking out my arse  i m just worried about them ,1,368,71
you mean the one anda posted 6 hours ago  if so  it s still there as of now  it s still a full socmed blackout for them though  can t remember what she captioned in this  should have taken a screenshot  but got too excited so i forgot ,1,235,45
yep  she turned stone into bread  good thing i had nutella on hand  couldn t ask for more ,1,90,17
 whistles in blackpink ,1,23,3
i thought maybe the blackout was over  since anda posted on ig after her performance today or yesterday in sk and rtee liked it but if this has been deleted then obviously not  always a pleasure to see jisoo though  anyone now what she said in this ,1,249,47
 sigh s in korean ,1,18,3
save me from this drought,1,25,5
exactly  thank you for coming in with the stats that clearly shows she is underfed  ,1,84,15
and say   i m jisoo  i m okay    ,1,33,7
i feel blessed again,1,20,4
 oops sorry yg i accidentally clicked post on this bomb selfie  i ll delete  ,1,77,13
maybe  sneaking into social media just to let a few blinks know they re fine  knowing that blinks will always share to other blinks what they sneaked into their social media accounts ,1,183,31
probably  she posted this around 4 hours ago  just forgot to share it here then ,1,80,15
i agree with this completely  i don t hate little mix but they re styles just don t match for me  and lm definitely have that sexy vibe which may be too strong for korean fans  if they did do a collab i think a video is out of the question  i much rather see then collab with a dj or solo singer  2 gg is too much  i m rather annoyed with the amount of clickbait articles suggesting there s going to be a collab just because someone said that they would  ,1,455,88
this is how they can communicate now  post then quick delet,1,59,11
she always is   ,1,16,4
took all my worries about them in a snap ,1,41,9
huh is it already removed on ch   ,1,34,8
did she deleted it  cus i cant see it in vlive anymore ,1,55,12
she has her own ways of letting blinks know she they is are doing fine ,1,71,13
she s soooo gorgeous,1,20,3
my day is better now  ,1,22,5
she finally breathed thank god ,1,31,5
so what is it that i missed  if any ,1,36,9
collab with azwz ,1,17,3
i m hoping they make a load of connections with producers  dj s at coachella  ,1,78,13
your reading my mind  martin garrix is exactly the dj i had in mind  i was listening to ocean on the way home from work the other day and was just thinking it would be a dope if collaborated with bp  i hadn t thought about it but your right lisa s vocal and rap on a track produced by don diablo  with that sort of understated sound he has  that s giving me chills just thinking about it  ,1,389,76
lisa s weight is 44 kg or 97 pounds  her height is 167 cm or 5 4  i never thought of her as scary skinny or anything  but seeing that episode really shook me  she has a bmi of 15 8  i don t understand how anyone in this thread can just go  they eat a lot they re just naturally skinny   or showing the clips from bp house  yg as a person is not exactly a paragon of virtue  he could definitely put them on diets  plus having bp house edited to look like they eat a lot  or just make them lie on camera ,1,502,101
i ve definitely noticed  debut  they were all pretty slim  and i saw rose was still have a lot of stamina and energy when she was performing on stage  plus she seemed to be naturally skinny  i never thought any one of them looked unhealthy  watching the gma performance just made me sad  rose s legs are almost smaller than my arms  i hope this doesn t sound like i m shaming her for being  stick thin  or saying she s not beautiful or anything  i m just very concerned for her health  with lisa  the girl is under 100 pounds  she s like 5 6  she is extremely underweight  i m concerned for her as well  although seeing rose in particular makes me very worried for her  she seems much thinner than debut  honestly  jennie seems to have the healthiest body of them all but she is also incredibly slim haha  i ve always suspected her  lazy jennie  issues starting because she just didn t have any energy  jisoo seems fine imo  i don t notice a huge difference from debut era  all in all  i hope this doesn t sound like i m body shaming them  i m really not  i m genuinely concerned for their health  they all look like they need to eat better ,1,1141,202
blackpink x martin garrix would be a banger  ,1,45,8
anda just posted on ig  ban may be over fingers crossed ,1,56,11
this isn t for me honestly  i m not really a fan of little mix  i m not sure its a good fit  for a collaboration i honestly think the best way to go is to collab with a dj  while i m not really a fan of dj snake and it was only a rumour  that s more the direction i d like to them go  something like the bts steve aoki collab  ,1,327,68
i agree it s a good time to reassure everyone  with stock prices having taken a hit and fans beginning to worry  laying out a solid comeback schedule for all his artist would be a good way to remove some of the uncertainty and probably improve stock prices  it will also help build excitement for the us tour  i really believe it s a massive error to delay bp s comeback  especially as i imagine that umg and interscope are probably expecting new music for their us promotion  yge may even be legally bound to do so  who knows  ,1,528,96
 i went to the concert at kuala lumpur and the price of the lightsticks are twice the original price ,1,101,19
will only believe it till i see it ,1,35,8
its about time he posts something  even if not bp related,1,57,11
 wow the modest envy feeling i got from this was unexpected  i kind of wanted to go there but eh  hope you enjoy it ,1,116,24
in my experience everything will sell out fast except for lightsticks  i can only speak for bts concerts but even on the way out it looked like they had thousands left and they must have sold thousands  what i did to remedy this though was if the group is playing two days in a row  which i m not sure is the case here   i went the next morning at about 5am to get in line for the store  unfortunately others have this idea too so i couldn t get t shirts and stuff but i was able to get pretty much anything other than those,1,524,103
clown nation at it again ,1,25,5
i watched all of them na yata    sobrang cutie nila       hope they have a comeback single or full album this year     late na kasi ako naging fan  pagtapos nung concert nila dito    ,1,183,36
you can have one too  click mo lang yung edit flair near the sub s subscribe button  welcome welcome  watch bp s variety guestings like on running man  the girls were so adorable  ,1,180,31
redbubble has some amazing stickers  really good quality as well  i just bought a bunch ,1,88,15
you wanna check if the venue allows lightstick  the sydney show looks like they won t allow glowsticks  so i m assuming they won t allow lightsticks   ,1,151,24
keep it,1,7,2
do they sell stickers   ,1,24,5
i hope interscope is knocking down yg s door right now demanding that bp s comeback be released soon ,1,101,17
lightsticks usually sell out fast at concerts ,1,46,7
i like little mix s latest song but this ain t gonna work ,1,58,11
any kpop concert i go to the merch sells out insanely quickly  even if you show up early  just buy it ahead of time  its not always cheaper  they can mark it up if they feel like it ,1,182,38

 yg  sadly  all im about to say is  bp disband     lol gotchu hard huh  nah  no more cb  lmfao    he ll say something along these lines  lol jk  hope the announcement will be him saying sorry about the delays on the teasers and what s the future for yg and the girls in general ,1,278,53
yes he still needs to address for yge and those shareholders,1,60,11
at the ikon concert i went to the locks were sold  15 more than it was online  also they sold out soon after so for those reasons is buy online ,1,144,30
hey hey    i m going to the blackpink concert  it s my first ever concert    in canada   i want to get a lightstick there and from my friend s past experience  lightsticks were sold cheaper at the concert  i believe she went to a bts concert and their lightsticks were sold  10 cheaper   so i was wondering for the other blinks from other concerts were the blackpink lightsticks more or less expensive  compared to online  and based on experience would you rather buy online or in concert  ,1,490,84
fighting hyun sukie oppa  ,1,26,4
well he needs address the situation and set the record straight so we aren t all left wondering  all this hiding without saying a word is bs ,1,141,26
same  hope hes eating well  and sleeping well  and not too stressed about everything thats happening  hope he is not pushing himself too much   ,1,144,25
i miss yang hyun suk so much hope hes doing well these days,1,59,13
if it s on the website  i have to think he s going to address everything  it d be the worst i understand that yg is in a pr crisis  but to not address blackpink s timeline for the next couple of months is only going to deepen the wound  there is way too much uncertainty from fans and shareholders considering the timing of this scandal is so close to blackpink s supposed comeback and western promotion period  ,1,412,73
well if true this will probably be the state of the union address i ve been hoping for  fortunately being from the uk i m about to go to sleep so this will probably greet me when i wake up  so i haven t got to wait for it  hopefully there s some good news  if true of course  amp  x200b ,1,287,56
yeah doubt it has anything to do with blackpink most likely about the scandal  don t be surprised if the comeback gets delayed because of it either unfortunately ,1,162,27
boxing training for sure ,1,25,4
i don t think it will be news about the comeback  it will be addressing the scandal  per the tweets  looks like it will be going on the website under the from yg section  ,1,171,33
you are saying they have a good track record  oh well any information right now is good imo  so i am looking forward to it even if that means  bad  news  ,1,154,31
yea it s a win win for bp and fans because scalpers paid for the tickets so bp get all the money while fans get cheaper tickets costing the scalpers  really only the scalpers lose lol and they deserve to ,1,204,39
i understand this may all be bullshit  but the track record of this account has been pretty spot on in terms of releases  take it as you may  i m very anxious rn if the rumor is true  ,1,184,37
i think it s much more likely that they quietly don t promote the release in korea  i think umg and interscope will win out and get the music actually released  but stuff like music shows  fanmeets  and variety appearances are off the table  umg and interscope won t care about those things as they aren t really things in america  they already got bp and talk shows  the only other common denominator of us tours from us labels is touring after releasing new music  they ll probably release  have a showcase on vlive so people can see the dance  and then go mum again until coachella  ,1,586,102
yeah and that s before fees  it s a good thing  but it s also kind of lame we paid so much to start ,1,100,21
i have a feeling that the entertainment industry side of the scandal is concluding since they re saying the corruption goes even deeper and apparently an even bigger issue will be brought up in the upcoming days  we shall see ,1,226,39
i guess she doesen t like to be like that in public then  shy  unlike lisa   ,1,77,16
i m just sitting here expecting a teaser from yg ,1,49,9
  i didn t see any of that at all  in fact  jennie and rosie joke about both of them being hubby  rosie  and wifey  jennie  when they re together  ,1,147,28
they re so cute   but i wonder  is it just me or ros  acts cold toward jennie ,1,78,16
lol the face of a 16 year old baby princess but the hands of a hardened elderly farmer  ,1,88,18
i thought maybe the seungri drama would impact the schedule somehow  but i guess they actually need to answer to interscope as well  maybe the deal with interscope will force them to stay on schedule    ,1,203,35
she looks so pretty in blue  there s that teddy again lol  ,1,59,11
really  i thought it was a cute funny little joke  ,1,51,9
 the minimal make up and the hair just set this look off  the outfit is dope as well and her eyes are killer  it s funny because i ve had this sort of fantasy that on the new ep there would be a jennie x lisa track that would be a nasty hip hop track  where they both just snap  it would be written by them of course  the track would be called queen s or reign or something like that  needs some work   it would be a full black track not an ounce of pink and they d just take aim at all the haters  the yg style of not giving a fxxx about what people think  this is exactly the concept i d hope for  all black outfits  sophistication and swagger  just wanted to indulge in some wild speculation  ,1,696,135
still not sure about this being related to the comeback  what group announces teasers and comebacks through a venue  this sounds more like a promotional deal  i m patiently waiting for more music  i ll wait another 2 months if it means the music is quality  just not seeing how these paradise city announcements are related other than timing  could be wrong of course  it s just my opinion  worst case scenario would be a song release that s basically a commercial for paradise city  haha  i think blinks would go nuts on yg at that point  hahahaha ,1,549,94
i don t know what is based on xd  i definetely think sm is coca cola since i see it as a more powerful company  the other two were random lmao,1,142,30
that s cool  they have something like they did at showcase event    for square up ,1,82,14
yea hopefully they announce something by next week monday  last cb they gave 2 weeks for preorder  but one week will have to do in this case they really need to get content out,1,176,34
dancing probably    ,1,20,3
i presume the comeback is still happening  they need songs for coachella and the concert tour with the setlist planned ahead already  it will most likely drop on the 29th if so bc billboard song releases are on fridays  ,1,220,39
yes  all i said was that she didn t have the best work ethic ,1,61,13
[this]   is probably why they have you tagged as a once who hates jennie  ,1,74,14
hes dropping all these hints like the comeback is still happening   ,1,68,11
it s a song about a blue heart ,1,31,7
my previous royal blue fairy   ,1,31,6
            ,1,12,4
exactly  this is a magnificent look and outfit really  jennie can really carry so many different styles  just so good ,1,118,20
ceo jennie kim  too bad she can t post these on her ig  would get 1m  likes in 1 hour  ,1,87,19
i understand how you are feeling right now  but turning to another side  at least we could see some bp updates  which is still a good thing ,1,140,27
it helps to just take a step back from the swamp that is social media for awhile  puts you in a bad mental state  that s what i ve done for the past week just avoiding twitter and other toxic places and mainly staying here for bp updates ,1,238,46
i deleted these comments as i m being way to negative which is something i try not to do  positivity from here on out ,1,118,23
a little harsh tbh  i m not trying to be negative  although i must admit it kind of sound like i am my bad  it nice to see the members and honestly i have considered taking a step back  the problem i m having is there s been a lot of negativity in the post i ve been involved in and i ve tried to help people be more positive but it would appear i ve fallen into the same trap  so i apologise  honestly thanks for waking me up to the fact,1,438,87
i see    yes i agree with you too  this paradise city thing has sort of witnessed the drastic change of what s happening these days     but i think you know well too that yg definitely won t say anything now  as usual   the best move he has done lately was the statement on bp already,1,284,53
wow i just noticed  what was she doing before this   ,1,53,11
those veins ,1,12,2
it just that these teasers were fun at first with all the speculation but now they seem to be dragging on a bit and not really saying anything  the only thing i m really enjoying is seeing the girls especially with the ig ban  at this point all i really to want is a state of the union message from yg just to let people know what s going on because there s an awful lot of negativity floating round ,1,400,77
omg i just found out winner had a fan meeting there and there s also this   it looks like an amusement park event  ,1,115,22
so you have no idea whats coming up but instead complain  how about wait you avoid these posts for 2 weeks and comeback and give your opinion once you see it ,1,158,31
u craxii maybe you ll be able to see them this time eh ,1,55,11
yeah and i think they will give away teddy bears  i remember they had an event at the airport and they gave away teddy bears too  maybe fan sign related   at this point i m just happy to see any positive update about them  ,1,223,44
no need to say sorry   just a reminder  thanks for doing your part for updating us about bp  ,1,93,20
i think those  shouting on the internet  is a proof already  ,1,61,11
i ll double check next time i think i was half asleep still   sorry  ,1,69,14
while i appreciate your concern for bp and all the other yg artist  there is no evidence of a boycott of yg artists other than people shouting on the internet and if there is i would like to see some evidence ,1,209,41
haha you got me i was re checking dates  ,1,41,10
yes  and based on what happened these days  it is obvious that many south koreans  including many non kpop fans  are really boycotting yg artists now   ,1,152,26
as much as love seeing my girl lisa looking gorgeous as always and slaying in that dress  this is getting kinda tiresome  i hope it turns out to be epic but at this point i m failing to what would make it epic  ,1,211,42
i honestly agree  at this point if it s anything that s not comeback related it will be a major disappointment for most people  i know these thing are sorted out well in advance but with things the way they are at the moment this feels a little tone deaf if it s not comeback related ,1,284,53
is yg even part of the big 3  i think bighit took yge s spot ,1,61,14
i was about to post this  god damn it,1,37,9
this isn t fun anymore ,1,23,4
all of the yg artists   black label under psy ,1,46,10
[excuse me but yg is definitely dr pepper]  ,1,44,8
you re getting some good answers regarding the differences between the big 3  however  i do want to stress that while seungri is the most popular name involved  it is not simply a seungri or yg scandal  it s not even just a kpop scandal  this is shaking up korea itself  it s regarding systemic sexual abuse that even involves high levels of police and politicians as well  it s much bigger than seungri and yg  the names haven t come out but there s no way its limited to what we know  you can bet people from many labels are involved  and it probably expands to other areas of wealth as well  it s focusing on kpop as the providers but the demand has been widespread  ,1,670,120
it s still pretty accurate tho the sales for each group show the power they have with their fan base  and just with the last years sales  it was an absolute landslide  but yeah if you consider the most recent scandals that popped up  jyp is on top  then sm  then yg at the bottom and is probably the worst place to be at right now in the public eye  ,1,350,69
yeah that s what i think too maybe some kind of residency or special concert  or maybe some bp inspired rooms  i mean it s a hotel isn t it ,1,140,27
by the way  i think you have mistyped the date 190315,1,53,11
their names are clear  it is seungri only that has been in any real trouble as of now  not yg  so far  and definitely not the girls  please do not speculate such things about any women female idol being harmed  it is unnecessary and will lead to bad rumours  they are not involved in any way  only as far as being under yg ent  they obviously had interactions on camera with seungri but we can have confidence that our girls are well protected by the management at yg  even if only because they are the biggest stars in yg right now   and the girls have been far too busy and very much in the spotlight since they debuted for them to be caught up in any of this behind the scenes  the only thing they must be dealing with right now is confusion because of the respect they had for seungri as their senior and concerns for their own careers and comeback ,1,853,161
i think that would beyond a major misstep  it might even violate the contract or agreements yg had been made with umg  there has to be new music or else why umg would sign bp  ,1,176,35
honestly  i think it would be a great idea if bp becomes a group under psy s brand ,1,83,17
of course i hope it is related to comeback too         many of us do         but comeback things should be released by official channels not by a resort ,1,153,27
that is legit what it is gonna be  i m not getti ng too hyped ,1,62,14
i think you should ask this same question in  subreddit because here there will definitely be a lot of bias and similar pov because everyone in this subreddit is a blink  asking on the  subreddit will give you more varied and unbiased views and you can use them to come to your own conclusions ,1,294,54
a cf ,1,5,2
yes thank you  people been saying that bp seem way too fake since they have different on stage and off stage personas  but yg groups have been like that for a long time now ,1,173,34
the reason i specifically like bp is for their duality  like  i d feel intimidated to approach the characters of their mvs  but they re actually fried chicken loving  heights fearing crackheads  watching all old episodes of bp house   ,1,235,37
is this based on popularity or flavour  this is subjective but    i prefer pepsi s after taste and i prefer hip hop music over the cute songs  so you matched it up pretty well imo  ,1,181,34
yg   badass  mafia like didn t know this was actually true  swag  hiphop  rap jyp   fun  bright  friendly image sm    not a fan so i dunno much except for suju in variety  people say they re the most obsessed with visual and perfection in choreos etc   yg is alot more strict with his 3rd gen tho  the younger artists are mainly just focused on music at least they re still establishing theirselves  than someone like seungri who only seemed part time idol with all his activities  yg stans like their artists for their duality being goofballs offcam and badass on stage  while performing and offcam  yg antis think the artists are all try hards lol,1,649,109
i m not saying anything but i ve been so nervous thinking about this  is there a possibility that they were raped or involved in some way  i really hope their names are cleared soon because this hurts me and i feel horrible for my babies,1,237,44
i wonder what this collaboration is  my new theory is related to a special showcase or concert  what are your thoughts  source   eskimo7474 on instagram ,1,153,25
what intrigues me is learning how each of the 3 reinforces certain singing styles  i thought that was simply group specific  but supposedly jyp singers half open their mouths and sing in these rapid short bursts  others  i forget sm or yg  open mouths wide and belt it out similar to an opera singer  it sheds more light on something i came across while researching the new group itzy  one commenter wrote that because the singer lia used to be with sm before switching companies  her sm past was proof that she could sing  i was confused  because    shouldn t everyone everywhere be able to sing  but she s their vocalist and not main dancer so i guess that s what they meant  ,1,678,120
this is kinda true tho lol,1,26,6
thanks  i did come across comments that yg supposedly threw 2ne1 aside when he knew he had a  prettier 2ne1  on his hands ,1,122,23
thank you for this  \ 3  i wonder if this is why jennie had that brief relationship with kai  i m sure there s been dating scandals at all companies but i initially attributed it to jennie s western cultural immersion and greater likelihood of  doing what makes her happy   like a stereotypical american teen   \ 5   at least in the u s coke has a much larger market presence over pepsi  which is why at many restaurants people will ask for coke  and some waitresses will come back with  we don t have coke but is pepsi ok  ,1,524,92
ty for this  yes   daebak    this is the type of info i was looking for  btw that girl in the video is super talented  i ll check out the netflix at some point  i was already aware of yg having been a member of a gen 1 boy trio in the 90s  ,1,240,51
that bun is basically a soggy rock  it s as dry a desert ,1,57,12
they never even mentioned jennie   ,1,35,5
this is the best answer regarding yg  tldr  yg is a dungeon and yang hyun suk is a lying sexist pedophile ,1,106,21
oh  in that case it s jyp  sm  and yg  but each group has such a varying level of success  i thought i d just list the current famous girl groups from each ,1,156,31
would you like the link to that post  never once have i said i disliked jennie  but cool for slandering my name ,1,112,22
have this person tagged as  once that hates jennie  so take with grain of salt ,1,79,15
so many once in here but not wrong answers  a lot of us like both groups  so take comments with a grain of salt but they re mostly accurate ,1,140,28
in terms of your point 5  i he means company wide not individual groups ,1,72,14
so when you know shitty yg is  you feel even more bad and sorry for the legendary bp ,1,85,18
1  i think it s pretty fair to consider jyp the  cool dad   all in all  he seems to take a very big interest in his groups  wellbeings  especially twice  but that may change with itzy being the new babies  and all of the rules and extra stuff he sets in place seem to feel less of  i am your boss  now do as i say  and more  i ve been where you are  i want you to be your best  this is how it s done   of course  this might just be me projecting what i want him to be onto his rules  but this is my personal perception of jyp  2  i honestly think lee sooman is probably the most competent of the three as a businessman  the way he conducts everything is very professional and he seems to have the most comprehensive grasp on marketing  i think  whereas jyp is full group or bust 99  of the time  there are some scandals and stuff that can account for this  but still i think it s largely detrimental as long as the group foundation is strong   sm is ok with red velvet segmenting and doing some solo stuff more frequently  3  i probably have the smallest understanding of yg  which is ironic considering where i m answering this question  it does seem like the more laissez faire company  which seems like things are forgotten for too long and unnecessarily so  it almost feels sometimes like yg had some unprecedented successes and just didn t know how to handle it all correctly  4  this seungri scandal is enormous  and to my knowledge largely unprecedented  it s probably hopefully a one and done  and that ll be the end of it  as to how he got away with this  it s not necessarily yg s fault  i don t know to what extent  but i d imagine seungri as a businessman is largely unconnected to seungri the member of bigbang  all of k pop are on fairly tight leashes  everyone is highly scrutinized and have to stay squeaky clean as far as public image is concerned  so many times the smallest misunderstanding has caused wild speculations and  scandal   5  i don t know who s more popular  coke or pepsi  but it is safe to call it that  in record sales  it s 1 twice  2 red velvet  and 3 blackpink  in 2018 sales alone  it s 1 twice  2 blackpink  5  red velvet ,1,2161,390
yg is smart enough to know that having no comebacks before bp s coachella and us tour would result in riots from the blinks  at least i hope so  he s on very thin ice right now  ,1,178,35
wtf weren t soundcheck tickets originally like  250  good to know the scalpers are taking massive losses lol,1,108,17
yeah  even if they comeback in the us stages  i still think it s important to consider how the korean public is going to take it  better to be on the safe side  like you said ,1,175,35
yg has been heavily criticized by almost  if not  the entire kpop industry for his  terrible  artist management skills  several examples of this can be shown by   seungri incident  2ne1 park bom scandal disbandment  replacing 2ne1 with 2ne1 pt  2  blackpink   cl and many other artists in the dungeon  lack of blackpink comebacks  dating marrying a girl at an extremely young age     jyp is typically known accepted as the best entertainment company today  jyp has shown extreme care for his entire company and is really known as a father  this can be shown from his actions such as   installing a fresh oxygenator in every room of his entertainment headquarter because he said he wanted all his employees trainees idols to be breathing the purest air possible   installing an organic buffet in his headquarters  recently he stated that he spent over  2 million dollars in one year just on organic foods  not only for his idols trainees  but for every employee that is under his company  because he states that when everyone is healthy  the company gets healthy as well   managing twice extremely well and putting content frequently  however  this is also being contradicted by many as people state that he is working twice a little too hard  but he is definitely giving them the breaks they deserve   pressing legal charges against those who are spreading rumors of twice being connected to seungri s scandal     i m not really that knowledgeable when it comes to sme though  hope this helped ,1,1494,242
they absolutely have their own cultures or  images  [this vid actually sums it up in a funny  and quickly  it s 2 14 mins ]   and it s so true shortest summary i can make  sm are your traditional  pure  idols  you ll find mostly scandal free   pure image   cute innocent vibes in their music with girl group  even their  sexy  choreography don t have very sensual moves  say compared to  exid  or aoa   biggest controversy with them though is overworking their idols  many have left and sued them   as well as supposed bias against chinese members  jyp is a bit similar to sm with the  pure  image being mostly scandal free  but their musical style is was heavily influenced by retro  which is mostly due to jyp s influence when writing music for his groups  you ll find a lot of very very simple but repeatable lyrics  that are always upbeat  meant to just get stuck in your head  it s all about simple  repetitive  hooks  including choreography   tell me  nobody  knock knock  10 10 etc   f you ve ever heard snsd s gee  it s basically that concept for the majority of their music style  no big controversies come to mind with them  yg is kind of on it s own with more western influenced image  they emphasize kind of the  gangster  or  cool  image with their idols  even in cutesy moments  bp don t have anything that even remotely resemble any of twice s songs  they re songs are not about simple they still kind of stick to idol standards with  dating ban  and what not  but style wise it s totally different from the other two  they don t worry as much as the other two about having  mimicable  dances or songs  anyways  if you re interested in the history of the three  there s a short 30 min vox documentary on netflix called  k pop explained  if you re interested  ,1,1774,299
jyp would be coke ,1,18,4
coke is sm  pepsi is yg  jyp is dr pepper i guess   ,1,52,11
reputation  w public imo   best to worst 1  jyp 2  sm 3  yg,1,59,13
sell to psy  ,1,13,3
not to mention mixnine ,1,23,4
can psy get all yg artists and put them in his company  theres no way yg ceo can survive this unless he steps down  ,1,116,24
jyp  sm  then yg though i wish to see treasure successfully debut  yg is a lazy shit fest,1,89,18
yeah  thats it  that makes sense then  its been really bugging me but that helps  it sticks out a ton to me for some reason  thanks ,1,132,26
no  i don t see anything weird in that area  are you talking about right where her thumb is  that s the reflection of her thumb ring  it s easier to see in this picture    ,1,172,32
last week she was all white for chanel  now shes all black for hera  truly a queen who can do both   ,1,101,22
this is very sick indeed ,1,25,5
ah ok got it  but kinda annoyed that they blurred our lots of things in the tour diaries  ,1,90,18
oh come on  i m both an inner circle and blink and that conspiracy s just ridiculous  this whole scandal  even though it started with seungri s club  isn t centered on yge or yg the person or the other artists on their roster  heck it s even bigger than the kpop industry  all these drugs  assault rape of club goers  corruption with the police  pimping women to business partners  gambling  tax evations  molkas involve corruption and probably kmafias too  seungri and the other idols involved in their gc is just the tip of the iceberg  this case wouldn t reach the korean equivalent of the fbi if it s just media related beef ,1,629,105
if they re going to pursue their comeback on the previously set schedule  i hope interscope intervenes and start their comeback promotion stateside instead  or debut the new song on before coachella  but yeah as much as i want them to comeback soon it s better to be on the safe side than risk it and the girls be shat on by antis ,1,331,60
they were a 5 member group  but in 2014  they were in a car accident that unfortunately killed 2 of their members  eunb and rise ,1,129,25
what happened ,1,14,2
it s just stans of other companies who already hate yg and this is just an excuse to  boycott   the general public loves bp  funny enough these haters seem to know the most about bp s activities and will be one of the first to check out their new song lol  they can t resist  ,1,276,52
its right where lisa s hand meets her chin  in that corner of her cover  its pretty obvious on the poster  lmk if you see it,1,124,25
it should show up  but yeah     works too  you re welcome ,1,58,11
okay i finally found how to do it   for some reason i can t see the smiley face   but now i know i have to type in   for me to see the flair   thank you again for teaching me  im new in reddit ,1,193,40
yes  for now they shouldn t worry about korean gp  they have to cater first and foremost to the blinks who have been waiting patiently and are so thirsty for new materials and to the baby blinks that they accumulated when they step foot in the us ,1,247,46
thank you  ,1,11,3
on phone  pick the customize flair  click on  edit  top right corner  click on the customize flair and it will show up,1,118,22
i can t see the smiley face   im using a phone   do i have to use my computer to see the smiley face  ,1,102,21
or just shut down yg and sell the artists contracts to other companies   yeah its not gonna happen  i know ,1,107,20
wts a p1 ticket  row 10 for this show at face value or best offer  please message me if interested  ,1,100,20
my boxset arrived in the mail today too  i agree that the box was pretty flimsy and mine was slightly dented because they didn t pack it well  i love the size of the magazines and posters though  also i was wondering  where is this white spot you re talking about  i m looking at both the cover and the poster and i don t see anything like that ,1,345,65
my girls deserve so much better ,1,32,6
i love this look  kinda looks like a  kimono  of sorts  doesn t it  anyways  happy to see my baby out and about  love the nails  love the simple style makeup  in fact  i d love a blackpink comeback all black like this  in fact  although i love the  pink  side i m reaaaaally into their  black  side ,1,299,55
this  i hate how obsessed people are with online comments and upvotes as if it s some sort of validation for their biases  it really isn t  even though naver is the  google of south korea   the people that take the time to downvote and comment negative things on an article are already a skewed distribution of people  the people on naver commenting is like the equivalent of reddit saying they ll boycott chris brown  nothing comes of it and chris brown is still out there being a piece of shit with no repercussions  like you said  we might be completely wrong on the effect that this scandal has on blackpink from the general public  but i m willing to bet that the gp doesn t associate blackpink with the scandal at all  yg has stated that he plans on having 2 comebacks for blackpink   the rose solo  we can debate whether or not he keeps his promise another time  but i might as well put out blackpink s comeback to test the waters on the effect of the scandal  ,1,968,175
at the time everyone was saying it was because of her popsocket    i didn t even put 2 and 2 together but that makes sense  also why phones where blurred in their video   thank you  ,1,182,35
it doesn t mean anything  internet hate has no real weight and it doesn t represent the true feeling of people  just look at the campaign to boycott the captain marvel movie  which is approaching 600m in just over a week  clearly it didn t work  these people who a hating on bp would be doing it regardless of this scandal  for this to actually be a problem people who love bp would have to start turning their backs on them and that s not going to happen  i may be wrong but i m pretty confident that i m not  2019 will still be bp s year have faith ,1,551,103
i agree completely  i ve been thinking a lot about this comeback as we all have  it will be a massive error on yg s part if the delay the comeback  obviously the scandal is a problem but i stand by what i said before the hate the bp and yge get online from knetz is not representative of the sk public as a whole  another thing i ve been think  isn t there a redeem code for the new ep attached to the north american tour tickets  so yg may not have a choice but release it or risk problems with interscope  i really hope that yg doesn t send them on their american tour with no new music  i really think that would be a major misstep  ,1,636,124
fingers crossed,1,15,2
this is how knetz are now trying to boycott everything related to yg as they longed for    2019 should be the year for bp to prosper but now     they can t do anything because of something which they are not even related     ,1,225,41
come back girls  we miss you ,1,29,6
good  we don t need their phones blowing up on them ,1,52,10
from the article on naver   gt  1  [ 2 156   423] don t put pictures of the yg kids up on the main page  it makes me throw up  naver  you invested 100 billion won into yg  your son s a dj at burning sun  is he  2  [ 1 234   359] i don t even know with black pink anymore         3  [ 793   263] black pink s american concerts are completely empty  there are a ton more empty seats with tickets that haven t been told while yang is lying to the media like everything sold out  they re trying whatever they can to bring their crumbling stocks back up  but of course  lying about a few concerts is aegyo compared to all the crimes they re facing right now  4  [ 523   202] boycott yg  i ll take a pass on everything from them now 5  [ 278   159] goddess 6  [ 261   143] jennie ya  you are always a precious presence 7  [ 249   131] shining jennie  so pretty 8  [ 450   335] really pretty 9  [ 419   305] queen jennie  pretty ,1,922,166
she bleached her hair at last   ,1,32,7
yes  so glad  hope they are not discouraged by any of this and comeback stronger than ever  whenever they do ,1,109,20
yes    i think they still need some room as seungri was somehow like their oppa    the girls must have complex feelings for all these news ,1,139,25
rosie had uploaded a set of mirror selfies  one of her best ig posts tbh    and but shortly after she deleted   archived the post  around this time samsung also used a clip from dddd at their galaxy 10 keynote presentation  speculation as to why rosie removed the post was that it had something to do with her phone as it was very clear she was using an iphone and that perhaps the girls had something in place with samsung  also their phones were censored   blurred out in the tour diaries  ,1,492,93
i feel bad too  i ve been watching ashley s vlogs and sojung s covers on yt and am happy to see they re going out and being active  waiting for their cbs as well  ,1,163,31
considering the state yg s in right now   ,1,42,7
glad to see that our girls are alive  hope they are not too stressed about the multiple scandals and the comeback and just everything that is happening right now,1,161,29
what went wrong with her selfies   ,1,35,7
and that is with only 9 1 songs  ,1,33,7
web designer here  if you want someone on the team  i m on board  obv fan labor,1,79,14
jennie for president ,1,21,3
miss them updating their instagram    wish they announce their comeback soon ,1,77,12
she is  butter knife might be all she had  555  i still feel sorry for ladies  code whenever i see them mentioned  glad ros  spends time with such sweet people  ,1,161,30
jennie looks absolutely stunning  wow   ,1,40,6
holy shit,1,9,2
200 million views for a dance practice is insane  not even mvs ever reach this many views   rip stay   ,1,103,21
girls have to remember to censor their phones in their posts and selfies    rip rosie s mirror selfies   gone too soon   ,1,121,23
and to think they were at what  6 or 7 million before their comeback last year  13 to 14 million growth in 9 months is insane  ,1,127,26
rosie speaking in small text   ,1,31,6
ok it s good to see yg doesn t just have them locked in a dungeon lmao,1,70,15
thank you    wow these numbers r really amazing  i guess it really is safe to say that blackpink has become yg s top earner,1,123,23
the  yg official  pronunciation is ros   but she personally prefers rosie so that s why the members  her friends  and fans will often use that instead ,1,151,25
and  she  prefers rosie  ros  is a stage name she was given while rosie very well may have been what she went by her whole life  no clue if she went by chaeyoung  roseanne  or rosie in australia though  ,1,203,39
ah thx for reminding me  [here]   you go  if you combine bp s 1 comeback with 4 songs   jennie s solo  bp are yg s top earners just from album sales  they also dominate in every other performance metric including international sales which isn t shown here  this is up to date till jan 2019 b c bp is at 250k albums atm ,1,319,59
bp is really black out now  they should immediately have a poster for this as well as the 20m subscribers ,1,106,19
i ve never seen someone struggle to cut a burger so much in my life ,1,68,14
lol never mind  they apparently got that title back in september  my bad  but still this can be a cute reminder for blinks in this worrying time  also what happened to the article about yg s sales and earnings  shows that blackpink has become the biggest earner in yg  i could not find it myself  thanks ,1,304,55
wrecking ot4 like it s nothing ,1,31,5
probably rosie if i had to guess ,1,33,7
happy for them   ,1,17,4
please please please i don t wanna see another gal gadot lapsus with the girls  ,1,80,14
stunning  ,1,10,2
silky hair  check simplistic makeup  check cat eyeliner  check red nails  check sassy  sexy  daring yet elegant black one piece  check boss woman mode  on multi billionaire ms  kim jennie is ready to conquer the world ,1,218,34
they got that title a while ago already lol ,1,44,9
ladies  code had such a tragic event and ros  is such an empathizer  i imagine she s shared a few tears with ashley  she s such a sweetheart  she s like an angel  ,1,163,30
need a boston venue nj is 5 plus hours one way    on a week day  need fri sat concerts as well,1,94,22
 gt  story i see  thanks  don t really see what that particular story has to do with the scandal but i guess they can t post anything while it dies down    didn t realise big bang was also yg  i am a strictly bp fan  the other kpop doesn t really do it for me  love the bp girls though ,1,286,56
breathtaking beauty  wow ,1,25,3
[press images]   ,1,17,2
ros  deleted her instagram [story]   soon after posting it  apparently yg artists are supposed to stay quiet on social media because of the ongoing scandal ,1,156,25
didn t know they were on a social media ban  why  is there a source i could read on this ,1,89,19
was anyone else extremely worried for that carafe of water while ashley was slicing away ,1,89,15
what did her schoolmates call her growing up in melbourne   roseanne  rosie  or chaeyoung  i always assumed  row zay  was just her bp stage name ,1,145,25
i don t think i like this  i want them to get lots of rest to give a great first impression at their first real north american concert  all that jetlag  if they look tired in any way the haters will bring up the whole lazy dancing thing again ,1,243,48
they are the [\ 1]   most subscribed girl group   in the world   as of right now  damn,1,86,16
collecting mechanical keyboards is a hobby now   til  i stopped gaming on pc a while ago  only play on ps4 now and use my pc for work  actually    that s a lie  i usually play csgo and rainbow six siege on pc since i m better on it   ,1,234,47
that s fine  but whenever you want a mechanical keyboard  come to  and be prepare to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on multiple keyboards once you re in the hobby  ,1,176,31
that looks so nice    and it s expensive  guess i ll stick to my surface keyboard  ,1,83,14
\ saying in cute lisa voice\  this one is working fine but i want a [new one]  ,1,79,16
so happy for blackpink  despite the current fiasco in kpop  i ll always stand by the girls and wait for their impending comeback  a part of me still thinks they ll have a comeback before coachella  hope the girls aren t too down rn in the current climate  ,1,256,45
noooo  we don t call her  rosie  because  ros   is too hard to pronounce  it s because  rosie  is cute  it s a cute version of her name  ,1,137,26
i see  also    your the mechanical keyboard you have now looks fine   you game  ,1,80,15
dropped it on a concrete floor from about chest height  i m about 167 170 so it s kind of a high drop  it shattered into a million pieces but i used a flathead screwdriver to pry it off piece by piece  also i m not buying the a50  my current phone is still working fine for ig and on the go youtube so i don t want or need a new one yet  but i want a new mechanical keyboard  ,1,376,77
lol i was about to look up how that accent on her name goes when i was typing that comment  but got lazy  i know someone will eventually point out if it s wrong anyways   oh look  ,1,180,37
the whole concert is just singing with heavy guitar background  this sounds so hecking well i want the full concert,1,115,20
jesus  how did that even happen  to get that a crack that big and crumbles apart  also    the galaxy a50 is a similar price to your phone  ,1,139,27
watch lilifilm official catch up with  and overtake  bp yt channel in a couple months ,1,86,15
 blackpink show   maybe they ll perform their new songs at this event ,1,70,11
i guess they will have to pretend to be using samsung phones when taking selfies   ,1,83,16
lol yeah your right  i guess even ros  takes too much effort since it sounds very french and doesn t roll off the tongue naturally for english speakers ,1,152,27
i ve heard the members call her rosie irl since debut  even ashley called her rosie in the vlog  ,1,97,19
rosie is for lazy ppl that don t use accents on their keyboard and can t be bothered to put in    ,1,98,21
i don t think it s her nickname  like it s used in real life   just a easier way to type it without the accent ,1,111,22
is it weird that i m delighted when there s evidence bp members have normal lives outside of kpop stardom  i guess it s more possible when they re outside korea  and lol  why does it look like ashley s cutting her sandwich with a butter knife  ,1,244,42
yet they all use iphones,1,24,5
oh cool  ,1,9,2
that s her korean name  koreans usually have a korean and a english name  ,1,74,13
but isn t her actual name chaeyoung  how does chaeyoung become roseanne ,1,72,11
her english name is actually roseanne haha  yg gave her ros ,1,60,11
her nickname is longer than her name  lol  ,1,43,8
the timing  my moto g5s plus has a [hugeeee crack]   on the screen  might sell my keyboard soon  ,1,97,19

[full vlog]  ,1,13,2
probably    yg has always been the black sheep of the kpop industry  they have so many scandals but the korean gp always appreciates the music and put them in a pedestal and because of this yg artists developed this superiority complex  the way yg does not bother to fix his relationship with broadcasting companies is a great example  and due to this superiority complex  kmedia is probably monitoring all their movements just to see if one of the artists will finally commit a grave mistake that would finally sway the gp  and there you have it  seungri finally fell into his own trap ,1,587,103
my thoughts exactly   ,1,22,3
im hearing a lot about this but i dont know what is happening,1,61,13
hey guys i got my blackpink billboard boxset  it s pretty cool  the box is not great quality and there s weird white spot on lisa s cover  and poster  like a photo error or something  i dont see how the photo editors didn t catch that but whatever  it s still a great photo of lisa  also  they pretty much need to have a comeback before they start the north america portion of their tour so if it is delayed it d only be a week or two  ,1,436,83

wth kind of rose is this  lol,1,29,7
face needs work but the colouring and detail is impressive ,1,59,10
 here are my thoughts regarding the comeback scandal issue  as much as i don t want the girls to comeback this march because it would be seen as a distraction to the current scandal  it would be foolish for yg to not stick to the schedule   tbh  he s always been foolish  no matter when they comeback  this cloud of negativity will always follow them because they are under yg entertainment  they cannot escape that  so it s best to just get over it  do the comeback  let the chips fall where they may  we will be able to see where the korean gp stands  if it s negative promote less in korea for now  then they would be away from sokor  then on to coachella and the north american europe tour  if the comeback is successful  i don t want yg to do his usual style of mediaplay  i don t want them to halt their activities just because some shady people are associated with them  these people allegedly done atrocious things to women and the fact they can affect the girls  livelihood would be another thing to add to their list of crimes  i say fxxx that  this is another test for blinks both korean and international  it s so stupid that the scandal didn t even come from any of blackpink members  i hope this is the time to clean up yge  thank goodness i already quit being a yg stan during 2ne1 s disbandment  blackpink is the last group  i will stan from yg  the board of directors if any of them are not shady should root out all their shady dealings  yg is probably shooked since his greatest creation is now in shambles  he has to realized that his misogynistic tendencies won t be tolerated anymore  i feel sorry first and foremost to the victims and to the faithful fans of big bang  well blinks it s time to square up,1,1726,313
they re legit  if you have problems entering the arena they will try to find replacement tickets or refund you the money ,1,121,21
[resale tickets for atlanta are insanely low ]   i spent my money on p2 tickets  but i couldn t resist soundcheck tickets for  80 each with fees  protip  if you go to buy tickets  then leave the site and have ads on  you will get an ad for 10  off or even  10 off before fees  the formula for fees is qty \   ticket price    ticket price \  0 26      7 50 per transaction  it may be wise to continue to wait and get these for even cheaper  but i wanted people to know as i love a deal and i love blackpink ,1,506,101
platinum tickets are just regular tickets at a higher price point  so those that are willing to spend more to attend if regular tickets sell fast out will do so  so you ll be going in and standing with the regular ga ,1,217,40
this should go into the world tour masterthread ,1,48,8
teach me please    ,1,19,4
for hot topic  if you re based in the us and canada you may be able to visit the actual store to grab a shirt  it s what i did in toronto   a t shirt was  38 cad before taxes  but yes  shipping from their site is pricey if you re not in the us   ,1,246,52
very nice  really like the purple eye color ,1,44,8
yeah i think it s that the nose is too high  i realized it too late xd,1,70,16
the detail  color  and shadowing is wonderful  but the face is putting me off  ,1,79,14
anyone have any experience buying tickets off stub hub  i m thinking about purchasing a couple vip tickets off there and i m just wondering if i should be concerned about if they re legit or not  ,1,196,34
haha  if we want  we can set up our own  help unfortunate fort worth blinks  where we buy cheap concert seats  and have people go  haha  do we have a rich blink willing to do this  ,1,181,36
from their perspective  the shows are already sold out  every ticket offered by the venue was bought at face value  but it seems that a lot of people only did that for the purposes of re selling for profit and there is less actual demand to go  for various reasons  location time definitely a factor  which is causing the secondary market price to drop so much ,1,361,64
there was a rumour floating round that there were 2 girl group members in the jung joon young hidden camera footage but that was confirmed not true  so anti s are dragging bp and twice saying it was members from one of these groups  i wouldn t worry its not true  thats why yg and jyp are threatening serious legal action to anyone trying to ruin their reputations,1,364,66
what are the rumors  ,1,21,5
i think a big problem is that these dates are midweek instead of weekend  that just makes it so much harder for a lot of people to actually go out  especially when they have to travel there from far away in the first place  i hope yg realizes this as well and  in the worst case scenario where a lot of tickets won t sell  doesn t totally think that bp has no demand  i think that would be foolish as well  with that being said  there is still a month left  there will be more promotions and a lot of tickets will still sell for sure ,1,534,105
oh i can t wait to see where it leads  the pics have been so pretty  what s up with the teddy bear ,1,99,21
i don t think they are either  i saw ikon was doing a message video for sxsw ,1,77,16
i m ready for the second pic  we need ice queen jisoo,1,53,11
it s probably an effect of much more supply entering the market  the scalpers were scared off and the 2nd dates weren t promoted to hard  ,1,138,24
she looks like an elf to me   a hawt one,1,40,10
this is all we are hoping for  and turning back to bb  sigh    this is the end of an era   ,1,91,20
i ve been tracking the prices for the atlanta date since they went on sale  it is crazy  you can get floor tickets right now for just  75 after fees  at face value people paid close to  250 with fees and are still trying to sell at that price on facebook event pages  its great for people who waited and i m sure the tickets will eventually sell  but it shows there just isn t as much demand as initially thought which isn t necessarily bad since a 15k arena was very ambitious from the start,1,492,92
praying bp comes out of this unscathed  in the end  bp are going to be the main k pop act in yg after all this settles  and i can imagine a weight will be put on them to rebuild yg s reputation  ,1,195,40
this means jisoo will be the main villain in stranger things ,1,61,11
i feel like i need to hire viper to just yell at me with facts and tough loveevery time i start having anxiety over bp  lmao ,1,125,26
i understand that you are concerned because you simply want the best for the girls  i am not different there  but realistically we cannot change anything about it and there is still a lot of time until that tour starts anyway  in between there will most likely be a comeback and us promotions  let s imagien the worst case scenario  the dates don t sell out and bp plays in front of like 10k people instead of 15k   yeah that would suck and would give haters room to attack as well  but overall that wouldn t be absolutely horrible either  if bp cannot sell enough atm they cannot sell enough and it is good to know that  it s also worth considering that these us dates aren t on weekends either  that might be a big deal as well  but yeah  let s just wait and see what happens in the next 3 weeks  i am sure it will be fine all things considered  d,1,849,159
appreciate the tough love haha   ,1,33,6
you should chill a little bit  there is still a month until any of it starts  they will promote it before that and tickets will still sell  especially when the comeback hits and demand will be higher because of that  if it looks like this in 3 weeks then you can be concerned  even though you cannot change anything about it anyway   but rigth now all it does is spread negativity and gives haters room to attack  i am optimistic it will be fine  even if it isn t 100  sold out  p,1,480,92
true  kuma was everywhere and he had so many solo screen time  tbh about the same as the bp members lol ,1,104,21
i ve posted on vlive as well to try to get more support ,1,56,12
thank youuuuuuuuuuu,1,19,2
thinking about it  streaming stay would kinda send a low key message of solidarity  it s always been close to their hearts,1,122,20
try adding the picture flair from the emojis menu instead of the list of options at the bottom,1,94,18
this is completely random  but how are you adding two flairs  lisa and rosie s pics   i can add only one  ,1,106,20
\ shoots jennie s heart arrow\ ,1,31,4
being streaming monsters is what us iblinks do ,1,47,8
is it kind of worrying that not many tickets sold for may 9  ,1,61,13
yeah  i agree  i want them to comeback when the drama settles and whenever it makes the best sense for them  and about the   too  i agree  it could attract antis  just worried for the girls  for now i think i ll just continue streaming  \ goes back to streaming ros  s cover for the 189847538th time\ ,1,301,55
idk  even if we got  blinkstaywithblackpinkalways  for example  trending on twitter that would just draw the anti s  i think whatever we tried to do would attract the professional haters ,1,187,29
my eyes are blessed by jichu s beauty  ,1,39,7
\ maybe\  a   that s not related to the comeback  like  hopebpisok or something like that  but i think staying quiet is the best choice  defend them when attacked or needed  but not too much  it \ could\  make for a bigger easier taget to get attack imo   amp  x200b  the comeback being delayed \ could\  be a good thing  i want them to comeback as much as every blink but right now is not the safest time imo  with the drama and everything happening now  the media \ could\  call them a cover up for the drama  an april comeback or whenever the drama settles looks much safer ,1,577,104
what s the difference between official platinum and the ga souncheck  i bought the official platinum ticket but idk much about it ,1,130,21
maybe not directly  but some collective thing online to convey the support  but i have a feeling that it might draw negative attention towards the girls amidst all the bad press for yg ,1,185,33
i m not sure there is a definite way of getting in touch with the girls directly  jisoo has been seen lurking in the vlive chat but this has been random and rare ,1,162,32
if those rumours are real i will be so angry,1,44,10
just enjoy  the live band really adds to another layer of their performance ,1,76,13
does that mean the album is titled  square down  ,1,49,9
apart from bp  the seungri shits also hindered bb comeback after the member s military service  but of course  there s a day when scandals reveal  but such timing     you see the correlation    ,1,194,31
and right before his most successful group s  currently  supposed comeback  makes me think   ,1,93,13
finally    another teaser,1,25,3
i feel blessed,1,14,3
jichu always turns my world upside down,1,39,7
exactly my thoughts on this matter ,1,35,6
thank god they re speaking out ,1,31,5
is nice to see that this collab is still being teased because i think people think that yge and bp have completely shut down which they obviously haven t jisoo look gorgeous as always  brightening up my day ,1,207,36
jennie and jisoo looks so good in these photos    or my ot4 starved eyes are beyond hungry ,1,91,17
conspiracy  negative news about yg and yg artists has been released continuously these days  it is possible that someone would really like to destroy yg himself  and how shitty the timing these news are released show how eager someone would like to destroy yg in a powerful and meticulously calculated way    ,1,309,51
fucking hell  to think things were finally starting to go smoothly with the way blackpink had been handled in 2019  now the comeback is probably delayed  who knows what the girls can and can t do to prepare for their us tour  and now disgusting rumors  to say they deserve better would be an understatement ,1,307,54
you are still going and will have a time of your life  think of those that cannot go and you have already made it on top  ,1,122,27
many of those are haters from everywhere and also those who hate kpop or even korea itself  netizens can be very sick  regardless of regions ,1,141,25
can t blame him  he tries to clean his act before military services but the past caught up with him ,1,100,19
every year yg will be hit with scandals  hopefully we can weather this one too  and the comebacks and tour will continue  everything is already in place to not proceed  yg need this more than anything ,1,201,36
exactly  no matter what yg should do so to protect the girls  this is one of the functions of yg  even though yg s responses are a bit delayed as compared to other major companies  sm jyp etc,1,191,37
there was also rumour for twice implicated  jyp and fnc have put out similiar legal action warnings ,1,100,17
our girls    they deserve better  ,1,34,5
sweet  i ll be seeing them on april 27th and i have normal tickets  still debating whether to buy from concert or online  just cause online has more options too  ,1,162,29
as they should  ,1,16,3
i won t have any first hand experience until may 8th  but i believe it s risky buying merch at the concert if you have ga floor tickets  otherwise  i think buying merch at the concert venue is fine ,1,198,37
the blackpink girls don t deserve to be caught up in this mess  i feel bad for them ,1,84,17
the yg apocalypse is upon us  we must repent  if we want cb to come out this march ,1,83,18
do they sell the same merch as online at concerts  going to their na tour and i want to know if i should buy merch from yg official or on the day of the concert,1,160,35
i understand your feeling this whole situation is draining but i wouldn t be so hasty as to sell your tickets  we have no idea whats round the corner  we could be listening to new music in a months time and thinking why were we ever worried  just try to stay positive ,1,268,51
what s with the ig ban   ,1,25,6
since you mention that you don t want the domain to be your main focus  you should try making a social media feed  the website would go through twitter  facebook  youtube  instagram api and post any content from blackpink s official accounts  it d update live  that could be a starting point for you  ,1,301,51
dang i feel like its a little too plain tho,1,43,10
true  i do enjoy wearing hoodies that are more subtle  though ,1,62,11
you know it s the real one because all the other bp hoodies are less than  20 ,1,78,16
[hot topic]   [ktown4u]   both places are cheaper than official yg prices  watch out for shipping from ktown though  it can be costly depending on where you are ,1,161,27
yes  they have a hoodie  it s a plain black hoodie with the blackpink logo on the left  here s the amazon link to it  [ ,1,120,24
they re making a big deal out of it so it s not insignificant ,1,62,12
could this be a short movie advert  cinematic ad  like the kia ad  like  nothing compared to a mv  but not nothing either  ,1,123,22
ive only seen official tshirts do they have hoodies that you know of ,1,69,13
there s some at hot topic ,1,26,5
they have official clothing  you can find them at concerts and even online at amazon  however  i d say that their products are rather pricey  i don t think that will stop me from trying to get some merch  though  lol,1,216,39
seungri is the one being investigate for possible crimes not bp ,1,64,11
no idea when it s going to be released this information is not revealed to anyone plus current scandal is complicating things  i trust my source he designed the set and the disco ball in the d4 mv and i knew about it before it was released  he also worked on the commercial for twice in thailand and aoa mv  not sure what commercial it is though ,1,346,66
so my sister is a big fan of blackpink and has never gone to a concert yet  i remember being her age and wanting to go to concerts so bad but being too poor to go  it wasn t until last year when i went to my first concert  bts   it was the best night of my life  so ofcourse i want her to go see blackpink  well i leave work early to try and get tickets when they went on sale  i was refreshing for like thirty minutes  but couldn t get tickets in my budget  i freak out  anxious and angry  and buy two tickets on stubhub for about  300 for section 306 in the back row for the fort worth concert  leaving me with about  6 in my bank account  i know  i know  this was stupid on my part  but i know that feeling of not being able to go to something you love  well now they added another day for fort worth and there are still tickets on sale in much more reasonable prices and i m kicking myself  how was i supposed to know they would add another show   i m just so mad at myself  i m tempted to just sell my tickets and buy new ones for a better price  but no one will want seats in the back for like  200  shame on me  shame on me   ,1,1133,231
who is this dude i ve seen him before what does this mean  this guy thinks he s a big shot huh ,1,95,20
i can t wait to see them live  iuiundhdjwkznnxndkaknwnsmxnxomg,1,62,8
i always see him post with bp  what s his relation to yg ,1,57,12
if anything i think this puts pressure on yg to start releasing material from their artists to divert attention  increase stock prices  etc  i m sure umg is knocking on yg s door as well  obviously it will put some unwanted stress on the idols but our girls are gonna be alright  they know their blinks love them and have confidence in them ,1,341,61
will never get tired of watching this  i have so many group angles saved from their seoul concerts    ,1,102,19
give this dude the nobel price  plz and ty,1,42,9
nah mate i don t mind  ,1,23,6
blackpink com is available for  15 000   just saying  ,1,54,8
i m so afraid of them being overshadowed by bts though  their first coachella concert might already be because it s on the same day of their comeback  in april people are already going to be onto the bts frenzy  their physical sales will also get hurt  implying there is a comeback  and promoting against the only bigger kpop act in the west will be tough  really afraid there will be no media attention left for them ,1,418,75
can i take this for my flair  ,1,30,7
can u show me a screenshot ,1,27,6
anytime i add text to the op outside of the title  i can t save my flairs ,1,74,16
works fine here on pc  amp  mobile  ,1,36,7
i m in mobile so idk,1,20,5
scalpers are literal scum ,1,26,4
are the flairs working for you  cos i keep getting my threads removed if i dont add a flair but the flairs arent working,1,120,24
that s true,1,11,2
at least they managed to release five full albums without the same repeated previous singles ,1,93,15
f x  would beg to differ ,1,25,5
lovin  it so much that they include their dancers   lt 3  amp  x200b ,1,69,11
rose is the queen of hairflips  amp  x200b ,1,43,7
i friggin love this video  ,1,27,5
can we talk about 0 04 0 07    did mamma jisoo just give her child jennie a disapproving look  ,1,95,16
that s what people thought on seungri in the past now look at where he s at  it s best that yg artists stay low for now,1,119,24
thank you   but actually i didnt fully followed the reference,1,61,11
thank you  d,1,12,3
well captured,1,13,2
dj snake is teasing new music  now i never bought into the collab rumours and i m not a massive fan but thinking about the fact that bp are supposed to comeback soon and they are both performing at coachella next month  i just thought it was fun to think about  i don t really believe it ,1,288,55
can you bring in a lightstick ,1,30,6
wow that is a really well done piece  ,1,38,8
honestly if i d have heard a couple of weeks ago that bp would comeback in april with no really fan fare or korean promotion  right before coachella i d have called bullshit but then sunmi came back with noir and flew straight out to her american tour  while i don t necessarily buy this  insider info  it makes a lot of sense from the to promote more in the west  ,1,365,68
well once the comeback happens they ll soon be touring in us for a couple of months away from this mess which is a positive  ,1,125,24
i agree  i can see why people are struggle with this whole thing it s a shit storm but i think people reading comments from  netizens  and assuming that it s truly representative of the opinions of bp or yge in south korea  while this is a massive scandal in korea which is far bigger than seungri at this point and i imagine that all eyes are on it  i really don t believe that the general public are all that aware of the connections between bp  yge and seungri  also i don t think they care  part of the problem is how quiet everyone is and i understand why they went on blackout but i think yg really needs to reassure people  ,1,631,119
that is really good  while rose is my bias  i ll always have a soft spot for limario      ,1,90,18
that s dope  nice work   ,1,25,5
god  this sucks  i hope they re doing okay   ,1,45,9
i know but i really can t be too optimistic though  asian culture is still different from the western one    ,1,109,19
yeah i don t think they are going anywhere  but the timing sucks  ,1,66,12
oh ok   sorry im new in this reddit   will fix it now    thanks for letting me know   ,1,86,21
hey u karkengsnowman  please repost this by posting the link as a link and not as a text post ,1,94,18
ah don t be so dramatic  bp ain t going anywhere  they re too big to fail at this point and the scandal has nothing to do with them  bp fandom is global and not isolated to korea where this is happening  most don t even know what s going on or care  ,1,250,48
by the way  i think in the short term  this thread should be the one of the few places in this sub where we can discuss something about bp and yg  and thanks ros  for her instagram story update lol,1,197,40
yes  it is definitely going to count on how much work you are willing to put into it  well if you can find a team  that s be nice too ,1,134,29
it must be just the idols then  my guess is the dancers have less to lose  or they aren t told anything about what s going on  this got so messy  what else is going to come out at this point  ,1,192,39
this is a shitty timing for bp really   amp  x200b  the jerk is the jerk  but now bp  lee hi  akdong musician  winner  ikon  anda  and even cl and many others  they are all innocent and their career could be all ruined just because of a single decision from the jerk  this is struggling to many people as their success really comes from that jerk to a certain extent  but the jerk is the jerk ,1,393,74
i just read that a black label composer called out seungri on ig saying he didn t jump he was pushed out of yge  which honestly was obvious  so i guess they decided to put everyone on blackout  which is interesting since the yg dancers i follow are still posting ig stories ,1,274,51
just in time before their debut at coachella and the rest of us tour hopefully,1,78,15
the silence honestly isn t helping in my opinion  especially ygs silence  umg and interscope can t be happy right now  unless yg is trying to separate the scandal from bp  but again  he hasn t made any type of statement other than they didn t know seungri was going to retire  i just hope the girls are okay  my worry now is their comeback is going to be rushed and pushed to save ygs face  there is still plenty of time for a comeback but each day it gets a little bit more worrisome since more and more comes out about the scandal  ,1,534,100
go forward with your original idea  but if you do stay committed to it  maybe if you get enough clicks every month  it will end up on the first page of google search when people type in blackpink ,1,196,38
i personally would like to keep minimal maintenance for myself so that i would be able to focus on features and work on my other projects  perhaps if i can set up roles for other people to maintain it    i ll consider it  ,1,222,42
i care,1,6,2
i have been worrying since seungri s scandal just revealed  and now shits all becoming real    amp  x200b  by now  i don t care whether bp belongs to yg or not  or whether they are popular around the world or not  i just hope that they can do good and i can continue to stan and support them   ,1,294,57

well  this makes me a little worried ,1,37,7
not the whole reason  i said part of the reason  you cant deny people will rally around an individual that represents them  thats why luka doncic and jeremy got so many votes in the nba all star game  that s why so many filipinos rally behind pacquiao  he represents the philippines on a national stage,1,302,54

links to youtube clips  such as bp house  interviews  etc  upload fan art with permission of course  maybe the reddit blackpink community can send you videos they have of the concerts or whatever  links to bp merch  concert information  not sure what else ,1,256,43

it has nothing to do with being thai or not  she just has an awesome personality and is genuinely a good person  she makes the other members feel better as well  ,1,162,31
pretty sure papa yg doesn t care about websites given that the other yg artists don t have their names reserved ,1,112,19
i think thats actually part of the reason  she basically carries the whole pride of thailand with her  thailand has 69m people  that s a ton of potential followers,1,163,28
mhm i thought so  still a nice addition though ,1,47,9

yg s tax evasion violations as well ,1,36,6
i don t understand why people keep trying to associate blackpink with this damn scandal  please stop already  just because johnson and johnson is being sued for [baby powder]   doesn t stop people from buying and using acuvue  band aid  tylenol  or any of the other 70  brands the company markets  just 6 days ago  yge released r tee and anda s song   what you waiting for   go back a couple days and see blackpink s brand ranking is holding strong at  1 for 3 straight months with the last thing being released jennie s solo 4 months ago  the only people that don t want a blackpink album this month are those trying to keep the 9 song meme alive ,1,648,113
i still haven t seen anyone making the connection between a blackpink comeback and it possibly being seen as bad for yg the girls  where does this come from  this seungri scandal is affecting yg because seungri is part of yg  other than that there really is no real connection so far  nothing which would make other yg artsts involved or anything like that  quite the contrary really  it just becomes bigger and bigger and is more about some prositution human trafficking rings  police corruption and as far as i can tell government politicion and corporate leader involvement  one could say that yg needs good press right now  and a music release is just that  it has no connotations towards this at all  it will just be seen as music and if it is good people will listen to it  even moreso because blackpink is one of the hottest groups in south korea right now  don t just listen to korean internet warriors who post kneejerk reactions on their social media and web pages  it s not different from our sites and not representative  now i am not saying that it is the best time ever to release the comeback  but i really fail to see why it would be better to not comeback at all  that s quite frankly nonsense  especially because as far as we can see  looking at the dates we know   it was always planned to release the comeback rather late this month and do minimal south korean promotion  there will be more worldwide us promotion in comparison ,1,1448,254
seungris mess of a scandal,1,26,5
exactly  this is also what i have been worrying these days  but i am sure bp will prevail  as bp is the revolution ,1,115,23
what scandal is going on  o ,1,28,6
he s a ragdoll  [source]  ,1,26,4
selling four tickets for the hamilton concert   section 116  row 15  seats 3 6   275 each obo  which is  50 above face value  i am willing to break the set if you re willing to purchase one ticket  if you re going by yourself  or two tickets together  send me a dm if you re interested ,1,286,53
hope they are okay  with all these things happening ,1,52,9
i think i prefer them singing in korean  i grew jaded with lyrics years ago so not understanding them is fine by me ,1,116,23
or have them do collabs with umg artists,1,40,8
is it just me who really doesn t want this  even as a native english speaker lmao,1,81,16
i really do hope umg scoops up ikon or winner  or have them shipped to japan again during this scandal  or include them and all other talents to the black label  yhs shouls probably be sacked and replaced ,1,205,38
now is the time for interscope to produce a full english album for blackpink ,1,77,14
i hope you re right but the whole 9 songs thing is gonna look a bit tragic when they come to the west,1,101,22
it should be related to yg apparently  yg artists can t show up now as yg is in scandal now,1,91,19
more international promotions c o umg interscope and have them collaborate with their talents to lessen the backlash  like rose with taylor swift or ariana etc ,1,160,24
i know there is a big difference between asian music scene and the western music scene  as an iblink  and an old iblink  i can separate artist from their label mates  i have seen many scandles involving musicians but never seen the backlash against the record company  for me a comeback would not be effected by the seungri debacle  but korea is their home market so would probably mean more to them to be a hit there than abroad  on the other hand how many of these people saying they are boycotting yg arstis because of this are not just haters that would have found any reason to hate on bp  your right about it being best for the world tour and coachella to have some new songs though  ,1,690,129
nah  interscope will still handle their stateside and non sk promotions  bp should focus on international promotions instead,1,124,18
who gave her those flowers  i hope its jk hehe,1,46,10
i think they will delay the comeback sadly but i think it s a bad idea in terms of their western appeal and i honestly wouldn t be surprised if their western promotions got cancelled too,1,186,34
true the backlash is crazy  even though blackpink s popularity has been crazy in south korea lately  and have gained many and many loyal fans  still this will not save them from the backlash they could potentially get  this is not just a  seungri scandal  at this point  apparently from korean general public s perspective  its a national scandal involving politicians and other celebrities and past events  so anyone linked to yg is walking on a thin ice as of right now  at the same time  this month is a golden chance for blackpink to have a comeback and properly promote it before performing at coachella and starting their north american tour  because they have gained alot of international fans since last comeback and are probably anticipating their first comeback experience with blackpink  if blackpink delays their comeback to april  they will have a week at the longest to promote it in korea and that s it  of course they would do international promotions  but they need those korean awards too at the end of the year   or if they delay the comeback further  after that from may to june  they have full schedule of touring  and so the earliest date would be probably mid june  and this could really affect them  they will officially become that group that has one comeback every year  and the competition is increasing so its gonna become harder to stay relevant no matter how popular and influential they are  so its probably a chaos at yg right now  and i really hope that they think about this well  and make the best possible decision for blackpink s future  because this is a crucial point in blackpink s career    no matter what happens  i hope we blinks nation stay strong and be there for our four cutie pies   ,1,1731,298
yikes  saw from twitter that lvmh pulled out as an investor from yg  it s a very bad thing  right ,1,98,19
yes shits got real  but i also think that coming back in korea will do no good for bp  and is very likely doing harm to bp because of the yg backlash  like many k netizens are now doing   it is now almost confirmed that bp s comeback is delayed  to at least april imo   and i think coming back outside south korea should be more ideal for them now ,1,348,68
whenever they have their comeback i ll wait for it patiently ,1,61,10
ig ban confirmed,1,16,3

melbourne concert   i m going alone to the concert  i have pink vip  and i m kind of looking for others to hang out with  all of my friends aren t in the kpop world so  of course  none of them are coming  but if anyone s willing to hang with a poor solo blink     chuck me a dm ,1,278,56
well interscope will force yg to release an ep to go along with coachella right ,1,80,15
what kind of cat is luca ,1,25,6
the scandal is really big now  i think bp s comeback should be delayed further ,1,79,14
thanks guys   it s awesome that you respond to feedback so quickly   just saw the new banner  it still looks a bit strange on my device    i don t know  maybe it s also not possible to adjust the banner so that it fits for every mobile user because it depends on the smartphone whether it looks fine or not ,1,307,59

yeah  but no one has posted it in this sub  so it s ok,1,54,13
it s been subbed since november i m pretty sure   ,1,50,9
      ,1,6,3
i guess they are shooting the mv in paradise city and in a way promoting it  and these hints are just some of the concepts of the mv  i know i am wrong and i am boo boo the fool  haha  this delayed cb is testing my patience  ,1,225,48
you re doing great things as mod  ,1,34,7
i bought nosebleeds at prudential for  47\  via stubhub today i m glad i copped the tix but i agree  i want bp to look out at a full stadium ,1,141,28

aww she s so cute    4k fancams   what a time to be alive   ,1,60,14
please don t get me wrong i am really not making any accusations to them  they are very successful now  no question about that  but as a fan who really wish they can be continuously successful  and of course i believe they can  i still feel a bit unsafe  maybe i am over worrying   i just feel bad and sorry for them as they don t have any say to their plans and their plans can still easily change  i understand this is one of the fan pages of bp and fans expect many praises and support  i support them too  but we still have to face up to the reality as the plans of bp is still connected to the internal management of the company itself  ,1,642,124
also  if there s any pictures you want to see added  let us know ,1,65,13
thanks for the heads up guys  just changed it now  had to shift the members to the right a bit so jennie doesn t get blocked by the icon   amp  x200b  mobile users   update the app to see the new banner ,1,203,40
[just added custom emojis that you can put in your user flair ]  ,1,65,12
ok  but then i don t see where you are coming from either  yg signed a partnership with interscope to promote them in the us and possibly europe  there will probably be more effort put into them this year than the years before and we already saw parts of that this year  the plans are 2 comebacks and the solo releases  now that can change a bit ofc  i would assume that there won t be all of the solo releases this year   the 2nd comeback makes sense though towards the end of the year  i just don t see what people mean with  deserve better  quite honestly  yes there could be more music at this point but it seems like this year will lead to that  in the end the success if what is most important  and they have plenty and they aren t even at their peak yet  as i said  i think people should really think about these accusations and contemplate introspect to see where these thoughts are really coming from ,1,910,169
of course they are doing extremely well but still they can be even bigger and better  to me  it s not only more music but forseeing where they are at two to three years  or even further  later from now  ,1,203,39
i don t want to get into all of this again because i did so multiple times already  but every time someone posts things similar to yours i think they should ask themselves what they actually mean with that  blackpink is arguably the biggest kpop girlgroup globally  it seems like they did extremely well  they are at a point where they are big enough to have a worldtour where they are able to perform in front of huge crowds no matter where  that is something girlgroups in general aren t able to  the girls are living their dream  making a lot of money and the growth doesn t seem to be over anytime soon  quite the opposite  so when i read  bp deserves better  i interprete it as  i want more music  and nothing else really  all i see is demand and not much else ,1,766,142
so thats what happened to bambi s mum,1,37,7
i just tried it out with a different banner  because u leonian made and has the original banner  works fine  u leonian  mobile banner size  1600x480px   ,1,153,25
in the long run  i think bp will do good if they are being under black label  yg wasted too much time  but the music of yg family is something many people enjoyed  anyway bp deserves better ,1,190,37
for some positivity  i m happy to say i m seeing bp at fort worth  if any of y all see a dude devolving into a screaming homo sapien incapable of coherent human speech  that s probably me ,1,188,34
i got a question regarding this subreddit  i just updated the reddit app  4 29 0 on ios  and saw this in the changelog   mods can now upload mobile specific banners for their communities on desktop   that sounds like it s now possible to have 2 different banners  1 for desktop and 1 for mobile   that would be awesome because then you could adjust the banner because on my smartphone i pretty much only see lisa and jisoo  ,1,424,75
for some reason this discord has seaweed and mushroom  why  ,1,60,10
she is one of the only voices out there which actually can give me chills and make me deeply emotional when listenign to her performances  i don t believe in god  but i can see why she says that it is a gift of god  it is magical  sohyang is imo one of the best female voices ever  she doesn t really try to be super famous but she could be  her talent is unreal ,1,363,73
it s not a hotel it s a music festival in japan lol,1,51,11
thank you for blessing my ears once again  the first time i ever heard this performance i almost cried  i still get chills lmao  seriously though more people need to see this,1,174,32
well now look what you did [seungri]  ,1,38,7
 gt  i agree  don t really see how delaying blackpink s comeback makes sense  i understand that blackpink will be dragged by haters just because of the recent scandal  but they d get dragged no matter when they release their comeback  i highly doubt that the current investigations are going to be over very soon  this shit is deeper than k pop and will most likely keep going on over the next few months or so   gt   gt  what is even more detrimental is if blackpink were to not release new music prior to coachella and their upcoming u s  tour  absolutely agreed  what people have to realise is that yg s plans are bigger than just korea now  this is about us promotions and possible european one as well  there definitely will be a comeback in the next few weeks  the girls worked on it  jisoo teased teasers recently  the hotel stuff just got teased which is probably at least somewhat related to a cb  etc   gt  i think international fans put too much emphasis onto k netz comments on a social media platform  i m not trying to lessen the severity of seungri s scandal  knetz comments are not representative of the general public imo  at the same time  i m going to take the side that if blackpink were to release a comeback on schedule  they would not be judged on their association with seungri  they d simply be judged by the music itself  feel free to disagree with me here  the people who take issue with blackpink being a part of yg or have association with seungri are the ones who already have ill intentions towards blackpink and are hopping on the bandwagon to exacerbate the issue  exactly this as well  ofc haters get more power with the scandals around seungri now  but they would have hated without it as well  the general public is more interested in there being illegal rings around these nightclubs  bp being under yg won t affect them there either way  or at least to such a miniscule extent that it is negligible   anyway let s hope the teasers drop this week so people can chill a bit  d,1,2012,355

welp in a span of 12 hours stan twitter went the brink of rioting because of no teasers to frantically praying that we don t get teasers for at least a week  lmao    fml   ,1,172,34
how  with the seungri scandal  i mean seungri has retired  i hope bb continues as a 4piece  hope the scandal wont affect bp  ikon  winner and other yg artists,1,158,29
so hypebeast,1,12,2
well i just saw a lot of people who get all hysterical over not having teasers yet and trying to make all kinds of accusations and whatever for why that is  when in reality a late march comeback wouldn t necessarily lead to teasers yet  even without any scandal  what haters would say isn t all that important to me or to anything really i don t think they were terribly close tbh  but it is hard to say  we only have seen them interact here and there for content as far as i am aware ,1,485,93
agreed  i m just afraid of all the dragging that s going to happen  this is terrible timing but i m hoping the girls don t let it pull them down ,1,145,27
isn t it just common sense that it ll be within the last two weeks  yg usually don t come out at once and since anda is coming out first  my speculation is that everything s done  they are just waiting for the timing and the girls are now practicing hard for the new choreo   ,1,276,51
hello  salamat     ,1,19,3
i think what people are worried about is the comeback being seen as a  cover up  which there will be some people saying that but it s not correct  the comeback was planned way before the scandal turned into this  but i agree  it s a big hit  i feel bad for the girls  can you imagine your  big brother  being involved in all that shit  especially it being degrading to women  it s gotta hurt a little  granted i don t know their relationship  their interactions just seemed like they were close ,1,495,89
some thoughts  the seungri scandal is a big hit to yg entertainment  probably the end of bigbang  general bad publicity for yg in the short term  stock drops  etc  so people think that this means the planned bp comeback won t happen after all  that makes no real sense  if anything yg needs the comeback to be a success more than ever now  i very much doubt they wouldn t drop it if it was being worked on all this time now  especially when they will start their us tour and added promotions in about a month  there are still 3 weeks until the end of the month  plenty of time for teasers and the comeback  don t lose your mind just because there were no teasers yet  for the last cb we had the teasers about 10 days before the cb hit  so i would assume to get news in the next week or so  because we are allowed to share anything i am just gonna share the best female singer in the world right now in case you didn t know her yet    hopefully some of you get as much out of her performances as i did   ,1,1003,196

the statue sculpture is from an artist called  kaws  that s his signature design  so maybe something with him    like a cf probably hehe ,1,137,22
it probably ties in with the comeback in some way  maybe they use the hotel to host the comeback on vlive  i m just spit balling  ,1,130,25
this is a hypothetical but if this has nothing to do with bp s comeback  which i don t think it has  why release these collab info know right around the time we are anticipating a comeback  as it would appear all these pictures were shot a month ago  now it might be because bp are in korea for an extended period before the north american tour begins  i don t know what it would have to do with the comeback but it just seems like an odd coincidence  maybe they will be play their comeback at the hotel or maybe it s nothing  i don t know  i m just in desperate need of some info ,1,581,111
the members even refer to her as rosie like half the time they re on screen  it s def fine ,1,91,18
that kaws sculpture in the back ,1,32,6
this has better be leading to the teaser for bp s comeback  only a little more than a month before their coachella and us tour so time is running out as we speak  ,1,163,32
cf   or a cf song  unlikely as those are far and few between  ,1,62,12

thank you    ,1,13,3

jennie looks like an ice queen and is that bambi    so is she like the forest queen   and also where are the rest of the members ,1,129,26
yeah  i noticed that    or maybe because the girls are focused on the world tour  ,1,82,16
i m from the philippines  ,1,26,4
    hopeful for album but anything will be welcome at this point  blinks are the thirstiest fandom out there because of the lack of songs  9 songs in 30months is pretty slow  the company owner yg says quality over quantity which i do agree with so i m torn ,1,257,48
no problem  and if its not personal can you possibly tell us in which country or region were you in at the restaurant  curious about from where new blinks are coming from  also if its too personal you dont have to,1,213,41
y e s    i need to watch more singing videos of ros   omg i love that she eats all the freakin  time     ,1,105,24
aww yeah  i completely forgot about the concerts in na and europe      right  i shall download this vlive app  thank you  the first time i saw the mv  i went bonkers for jennie  too  then i started watching bp house  that s when i started to appreciate their individual  charms  if you must  when you say comeback  does this mean a new album  a new song  ,1,355,66
omg  bless you     i have recently subscribed to pastadabs    i love the videos  i am literally lol ing over dem videos at 3am    cries in gay over these descriptions  thank you  i appreciate this so much       ,1,211,37

basically a bias wrecker is a very close second favourite  coincidentally i m aussie as well  but found that out about her after i had already established my bias  that singing voice   ,1,185,31
i think they could use a real vacation but they have a packed few months coming up so ain t much chance of that  you were right that us fans are called blinks  i started out a jennie stan but now i love all the girls    although jennie does keep attacking me  you should download the vlive app  there are a few good live videos from them and should be more in the future with the comeback soon ,1,394,77
thank you  i think i binged watch blackpink house  finished it in around 3 days or so  it s the main reason why i wanted to get to know them more  but is it just me or the girls deserve some more vacation   i mean  if i remember correctly  it was their first time to go on trips in the 2 3 years of bp s existence  man  that s rough    ,1,336,68
ohhh  thank you   so my bias is lisa and my bias wrecker is ros  sometimes  i hope i m using these terms correctly    ros  is such a sweetheart   i love her aussie accent      ,1,176,34
[blackpink house]   is a must ,1,30,5
a bias is your favourite member of the group  a bias wrecker is someone that is dangerous close to taking over that spot  they can occasionally does something cute funny awesome to temporarily take it   my bias is rose  my bias wrecker tends to change a lot  all of the girls are great and frequently do cute or funny stuff ,1,324,58
i agree the average person more than likely doesn t even know that bp is managed by yg  i think sometimes we as fans forget people aren t as informed as we are and they also don t care to be  most people just want new music from their favourite artist and don t really care about the politics of it,1,298,57
well can you blame them  considering all the crazy shit going on at yg with seungri  scandals  national investigations  now seungri retires etc  its real bad time for bp too  idk what yg s gonna do next,1,202,36
 i read about abuse,1,19,4
my only problem with this situation is that it doesn t feel like yge is in control  other groups that comeback in april  they already announced that they filmed the mv weeks ago  already communicated officially about it  that makes it feel like they re in charge of the situation  everything is going smoothly  meanwhile for blackpink we had so vague words about  mid to late march   no mv talk  no details  nothing official  and it looks like it might be delayed to the last possible minute before their us tour  it doesn t feel as well oiled an operation  like they just came up with it  i hope it won t be  but i m worried it might be rushed and no as well planned  which is weird because they had all the time in the world to prepare to this  i hope those worries aren t justified  but we ll see ,1,800,146
done  thanks for informing me about that ,1,41,7
so does lisa take her cats with her wherever she goes  blackpink flies around a lot  do the cats still go with her then ,1,120,24
not sure where the dogs go but yeah maybe their parents ,1,56,11
i see you re a pok mon trainer yourself  well  what team name would leotwo and lucat make ,1,90,16
and the dogs get sent to their respective motherpinks  houses i believe ,1,72,12
dont get me started on the poke teams i make up in my head that she has   ,1,74,17
she s even willing to be late for her workout session to play with leo  also  luca has some nice pok mon vibe going on  can t say lisa s not a pok mon trainer coz i think she is ,1,178,35
i am not sure how the mods here operate  but i think rumors unconfirmed maybe a better flair for this thread  as after all there s no concrete source for all these  info   anyway  it shows that many people are really anxious about bp s comeback  but no one can do a thing on it so rumours just keep arousing ,1,308,57
this is such a beautiful drawing   did you use any picture for reference  ,1,74,13
you can check if it s a bot if they follow thousands of people  usually have some dodgy profile picture and isn t active at all  ,1,129,24
she spoils them so much    ,1,27,6
they get sent to a nice animal daycare center anyway so plenty of things to do ,1,79,16
i read about abuse,1,18,4
i ship them,1,11,3
i just saw this on twitter a few times and thought it was interesting  so i copy pasted it here  i m new to the whole kpop scene  so i didnt even know what exactly a  saesang  is until i read it here in the comments  i m sure these are just speculations ,1,254,51
honestly no  i just saw this posted a few times on twitter and thought it was interesting and specific  just wanted to share this because people are getting impatient and anxious about the cb and this brought a relief to me  knowing that we still have time  cb is not cancelled yet   these are just rumors everyone  don t take at face value  is it inappropriate to post this kind of stuff in here  ,1,398,73
lisa  ,1,6,2
i ve seen the real picture and it looks pretty much the same to me   ,1,69,15
i hope you eventually got decent tickets  resells were obscenely high only the first 0 7 days after they sold  now many are back near face value and at vividseats  upper section nosebleeds are going for as little as  27  ,1,221,39
it s extremely doubtful  i highly advise you rebook to an earlier flight  even if it lands ahead of schedule  say  7 14 pm  it takes time for the plane to be assigned an open gate  more minutes wasted as passengers deplane extremely slowly  and you would have to stand in line to go through customs  though the arena is close to the airport  expect traffic jam surrounding the area so more minutes wasted  ,1,406,72
do you have source for all these information op ,1,48,9
you get the soundcheck and the actual concert ,1,46,8
yes ppl make a big deal about scandals that have nothing to do with bp  but the general public is very excited about a comeback ,1,128,25
i feel sorry for the girls  they deserve way much better ,1,57,11
im pretty sure they know bp is innocent in all of this but i think the korean public is more focused on yg giving a statement apology and anything else would be seen as trying to distract from the real problem  that s why i think bp promo in korea could be met with backlash  if yg doesn t address and settle their problems before  ,1,332,62
this info is just common sense   it s not  saesang info   bp barely has any saesangs anyways  they travel with like 3 4 security wherever they go as well as their manager s   their security team and managers also all have public social media so i doubt they d be selling private info either ,1,291,50
it s not their song ,1,20,4
i still hear the song on the radio here in northern europe which is weird because you don t hear any other kpop artist on the radio  but also its amazing,1,153,30
it s dua s song  not blackpink  they were asked to be on the song  they didn t make the song  how could they make it their title track  ,1,136,26
i keep thinking the scandal is over and it just gets worse and worse  i would hope people could separate bp and the scandal but coming from the same company  who knows  ,1,169,32
the whole timing of the scandal is soo bad   every day that passes by i keep worrying  blinks and blackpink don t deserve a rushed comeback after the long wait  i can only imagine what stress is happening at yg right now,1,220,41
blackpink was trending last i checked for the result blackpink comeback  and the members names,1,94,15
 gt   they will come in the last week of march almost april according to sasaengs or maybe the first week of april dddd teaser didn t drop until 10 days of release so still plenty of time for a late march release   gt   they keep choosing the songs and they will have more than expected  gt   interscope is pushing yg to have more songs sounds like speculation how would they know   gt   yg is not in social media due to the scandal this is protty obvious since he didn t post 700m poster or anda s dance practice   gt   they will not have many promotions in korea for different reasons the scandals  again speculation although they will not have time to promote as long as in the past since they have a tour shortly after  scandal has nothing to do with it since bp is loved by korean public and they don t care about scandals as ppl think or even know   gt   good promotion from interscope yes they probably have tv shows and interviews lined up while in la b c that s where the entertainment industry resides  ,1,1013,182
i can imagine things being very tense at yg right now  theres blackpink comeback pressure x2 because of their upcoming concerts in the west and they need to release their new songs or all that western promo would be for nothing and the pressure from seungri and yg s scandal  also i feel like korea is emotionally invested in this scandal that blackpink promo could possibly be met with backlash  hopefully it wont  but at this point  who knows what will happen  ,1,463,81
i wonder if they are planning to promote at all  i mean  that would be weird for them not to but everyday that passes without teasers or a release day it makes more sense  they are losing time to promote  unless they plan on flying back to korea between coachella performances ,1,277,51
sasaengs are like paparazzi and mafia rolled into one  ,1,55,9
not sure how sasaengs would have this kind of info  but okay    and some of the points are kind of already obvious like yg being silent on social media because of scandal  of course people want more songs  if they dont release until end of march  of course they wont have time to promote  concerts and scandal   etc ,1,316,58
i try not to support sasaeng info  because of the extremes they go to get info  i can see some of this being true though  especially interscope pushing yg for more songs ,1,170,32
have not heard about  saesang info   can you send us the link ,1,62,12
so now luca and leo are my biases,1,33,8
also  happy cake day ,1,21,4
also keeps them busy especially that lisa  being on tour  will be away for most of the time now ,1,96,19
this is a good idea for indoor cats  gives them some physical exercise ,1,71,13
i m so desperate for anything blackpink music related  trying to be optimistic here but god  why must yg and seungri do some shady shit  ,1,137,23
nice  i ordered the boxset as well  was wondering when it might actually ship,1,77,14
a ton of words in korean are just borrowed english words  like chicken       chi kin   so it makes sense that it s in hangul  the korean public doesn t say blackpink  they say       beul laeg ping keu   same thing with super junior          syu peo ju ni eo  ,1,259,42
insanely good  you re very talented  ,1,37,5
me too  but cats will always be so curious ,1,43,9
lmao that jobless culture though  i feel ya  anyway  yeah i agree  dalgom s the most popular among the pet pinks  and then jennie s kuma  amp  kai  lisa s leo  amp  luca  and rosie s joohwangie  i do think leo  amp  luca are the visual of pet pink  i was leaning towards leo before  but it s undeniable that luca is a very beautiful cat  and i still believe joohwangie is not a fish  who can high five their owner  or enjoy being touched  only joohwangie  ,1,456,82
i didn t know cats liked to do that ,1,36,8
fucking shit  it s so good ,1,27,5
wow this is amazing  you are so talented and hardworking  ,1,58,11
yeah  she looks little bit different than on real picture  maybe that s because this is my first time drawing a portrait  ,1,122,21
this looks sick  dont get me wrong when i say  but somehow the facial structure feels different  good job though with that drawing ,1,131,23
luca   soon    ,1,15,2
wow         ,1,12,2
holy shit nice  hope she notices this because this is unbelievably good,1,71,12
jesus  teach me  this is so good ,1,33,7
i would rate this drawing  call me pretty and nasty  you did an amazing job on this one and it was the best thing i saw today x ,1,128,28
great work  love it ,1,20,4
most people aren t  fascinated  by the numbers but as big fans of the group  it s good to see the girls continue to grow in popularity  of course you also have to understand there aren t major news regarding the group every single day therefore there isn t a lot of meaningful content to be posted  hence why you may see a lot of trivial stuff  which is fine because trivial content is still better than no content  ,1,416,75
thanks man   ,1,13,2
i saw this post on your instagram and i wondered if i could like it twice  and then you uploaded on reddit so i actually could lmao  great drawing dude ,1,152,30
but it s not translated in korean it s just the pronunciation in korean alphabet ,1,81,13
it is frustrating  i m also worried about a delay but i just feel that it is a perfect time to release new music  it will take some of the focus of the legal issues  it will increase yg s stock price  it will boost enthusiasm for the world tour and most importantly it will give the haters less ammo  so for me it couldn t be more perfect but i m not yg  like you said fingers crossed that tomorrow brings some info  ,1,417,80
i love all the cat updates lately  ,1,35,7
yes  it s very frustrating not knowing anything new about their comeback  let s hope tomorrow more info will be out  i m just scared it all gets delayed because of all yg legal issues going right now  fingers crossed it won t affect blackpink   ,1,245,42
thanks a lot   i will draw the rest of them as well  i hope they will see it too ,1,81,19
naw  not really chill  more like mildly warm  definitely not chill ,1,67,11
many talented artists are releasing their good works these days before bp s comeback  ,1,86,14
um this is amazing     i hope you draw the rest of the bp members  they need to see this ,1,89,19
that s what i ve been thinking  having said that if it just hotel promotion what makes it epic   my heart wants to believe it s to do with the much hoped for comeback  what that would be though is lost on me  my head thinks it s a coincidence  maybe we re just looking for connections where there are none because the lack of information  ,1,339,61
funniest thing is that she is not even korean  d,1,48,10
i felt like a proud mom when i saw this ad  ,1,44,12
in just 268 days  what a legend  we stan queen    ,1,50,11
am not surprised  lisa is a star ,1,33,7
she s wearing the   ace maxi dress   by   for love and lemons    retailed at    366  ,1,85,14
there is a rumour about this being related to their comback but i think it might just be a collaboration to promote this hotel   ,1,129,25
i would also prefer pink ,1,25,5
ok thanks,1,9,2
i m on my phone atm  i ll try to look it up later  ,1,51,12
do you possibly have the link to the financial statement or the article about the sales and earnings  also thank you for responding,1,131,23
yes bp are by far the biggest earners for yg atm  even all 3 comebacks ikon had last year couldn t beat bp s one comeback when it came to album sales ,1,150,30
is it safe to say blackpink is becoming yg s new cash cow since bigbang is inactive right now  or are they not there yet  im asking you since you seem to be really knowledgeable about the overall yg artists,1,206,39
hello  i have two p2 tickets section 309 row p for the forth worth concert  i m willing to sale below face value message me your offer  i paid 360 for them  it s for the 5 8 date  i would also be willing to trade for the 5 9 date  just really need the money atm  ,1,263,53
i m already looking forward to the next pictures  ,1,50,9
so talented  the detail in the hair is beautiful,1,48,9
that portrait is truly amazing   you did a fantastic job  ,1,58,12
thank you    i have one more drawing of lisa i didn t finish but after that in next few months i ll draw the rest of the group too  this one took me about 15 hours to finish,1,173,34
wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww you are damn talented  do u plan on drawing other members or the whole group  not that u have to  just curious also how long did it take to draw this ,1,179,32
oh i don t know this lady but i liked this a lot  i like how she did an english version  i think i m now interested in d4 in english  ,1,134,29
curious how to check if it s bots or not  pretty sure most of my followers are actual human beings ,1,99,19
i think the pink upvote colour is better than green lol,1,55,11
and yet  here you are ,1,22,5
268 days already   time really flies  i was there the first hours they opened the accounts ,1,91,16
youtube changed that a while ago  bot views count up to 300 but after that it will stop  since all of bp s videos have millions and millions of views  bots don t affect their video  ,1,182,34
everyone has bots following their account  if it s not set on private   even back when i had less than 200 followers i had like 50 bots following me out of nowhere  ,1,165,31
it s weird too that itzy is the only one written in both,1,56,12
awful assumption  ,1,18,2
you re welcome ,1,15,2
when jennie tripped lmao,1,24,4
you kinda sounded like a typical bp hater who got lost on the wrong subreddit  no  ,1,83,16
sort of  both are interfered by bots  viewing manipulation  ,1,60,9
maga fans buy bots tho,1,22,5
so is the mvs view counts if you used the same logic  just an irrelevant milestone  no ,1,87,17
i am chill  he wanted to know why i told him   ,1,47,11
chill dude     lol,1,18,4
it s a milestone  don t check the post if you re not interested ,1,64,11
 gt  the rankings are determined every month by analyzing consumer participation  media coverage  interaction  and community indexes of various girl groups  there s a methodology to how they calculate it  usually when you have a comeback it gives your rankings a big boost  what s amazing is bp has been able to stay at  1 and with a huge gap too without having any comebacks  i d imagine their points total would go through the roof once they have their comeback  ,1,465,78
why is tracking instagram numbers even a thing on this sub  lol,1,63,12
honestly i wasn t until i realised that yg has been inactive on instagram for 4 days which is unusual  i m still holding out hope that this bp comeback will still happen as we have had a steady stream of rtee x anda content on youtube in this time  although they may not have has choice in that  as for what will happen if yg were to go to prison  honestly nothing a new ceo would be appointed and then business as usual  if you believe the billboard cover story teddy already has creative control over bp  obviously yg has final say  so it wouldn t be a stretch for them to move under the black label as they kind of already are  ,1,631,121
she is the fastest k pop idol to reach 16m followers in just 268 days ,1,70,14
i have the same worries as you  c also thank you  ,1,50,11
i m beginning to get a bit nervous as to whether this fabled comeback is actually going to happen  i m also concerned that if it does happen we ll only get a handful of songs which will be frustrating  i always like to be grateful for what we get but after thinking about it more and reading between the lines it feels like bp has a secret library full of recorded songs that yg is hording for some unknown reason  i m probably being paranoid but who knows anymore  good look with your exam i m sure you ll do great  ,1,517,96
i never take these too seriously since i have no idea how they re calculated  but i do remember that early 2018 before dddd they were hovering between 4th or 6th  quite below other popular groups  and we all know how that comeback played out  this year they re already comfortably 1st so it might be that much bigger ,1,317,57
yeah  she looks great with her hair up  ,1,40,8
funny timing  ,1,14,3
i have an important exam on the 12th and 13th of march  if blackpink post teasers in the next few days that would improve my mood a lot ,1,136,28
i really wanna see her with a ponytail in that outfit,1,53,11
i hope this sub does not get more haters,1,40,9
blackpink is the revolution   ,1,30,5
it looks fake to me  almost like it s fan made ,1,47,10
[doesn t even match the og one  fake ]  ,1,40,7
btw someone who posted this on twitter said its real,1,52,10
my friend can t go anymore so i m selling one ticket   p3 sec 223 row 8 seat 4 pls i really wanna get rid of it   ,1,114,25
yah  her twitter has been invaded by blinks all morning ,1,56,10
she plans on doing more covers of bp and maybe a full version of dddd so keep an eye out ,1,89,20
only know 1 of her [song ]   done by chainsmokers and her  but gaddamn this cover is so lit me and my friends been retweeting all day about this cover ,1,151,30
they look really tall,1,21,4
damn blackpink did not have a comeback or scandal  and yet they are in 1st place  they really are powerful,1,106,20
very nice cover     you can see the influence of lisa in her look   ,1,68,15
wow  thank you for making further improvements on this sub  the perfect blackpink sub  happy 20k subscribers   we grew so much last year  and we re still growing this year  can t wait how the next comeback will affect this sub  cheers  ,1,236,40
b c names like clc or exid are just made up words  blackpink can actually be translated in korean ,1,98,18
does anyone know why it is written in hangul  i see aoa  clc  and exid romanized so the makers of the chart can write it as blackpink  i can never figure this out  some korean shows i watch have names  groups  and songs written out one way or the other with almost no consistency  i an understand gfriend or wjsn since those are using korean english translations but if i m not mistaken  this is actually hangul pronunciation of blackpink and not the colors black and pink translated ,1,484,86
i think i read this at exactly the right time  because when i read this first  there was only the upvote icon  when i refreshed the page  and read this again  there was both the upvote and the downvote icon  it was like your comments were illustrating what was actually happening  or my computer glitched  either way  that was cool  amp  x200b ,1,344,61
yaaaay   the light stick upvote buttons are so cute too ,1,56,10

i literally uploaded the light stick with color seconds before u commented ahah  try now,1,88,15
when downvoting only the number in the middle changes color but not the light stick itself ,1,91,16
looks good  ,1,12,3
yes  the people on this sub are so kind and supportive  this sub definitely deserves it ,1,88,16

yg s face  smiling  ,1,20,3
just the regular downvote button  planning to maybe put the light stick as a downvote button  just the other way around ,1,120,21
the down button should be the face of yg  for not releasing the cb teasers ,1,75,15
what s the downvote button  can t see because i m using dark mode on my phone  ,1,79,14
this was us as well  did you buy the day 2 tickets instead of the day 1 ones  i went ahead and bought a pair of resells for day 1 because they were so much cheaper for better seats  couldn t justify buying tickets at face value for day 2 seeing how cheap they were on stubhub,1,275,56
a couple days ago  ,1,19,5
and the upvote button is the light stick  when did this happen ,1,63,12
looked at tickets again today to cross examine the tickets i bought for wednesday  there are so many tickets available  part of the reason why we went ahead and bought the wednesday tickets even though the thursday tickets would have worked better for our schedules is that they were so much cheaper for better seats  at this point  i m thinking of buying extra tickets for my non kpop fans to introduce them to bp and fill some seats,1,434,77
leo s grown so much  he s not a floof baby anymore uwu,1,54,11

andrew oh   chief of future strategic planning at paradise city  paradise city is a hotel that has done several promotions with yg artist  ,1,139,24
who s eskimo  the only paradise city i know is the gnr song  can i get some background ,1,87,17
anyone knows the bag policy for this venue  ,1,44,8
most venue rules are stated on your ticket  when you receive your ticket take a look at all the documentation in the packaging  ,1,128,23
and lisa is the only one that looks like herself  the other three just look like random people ,1,95,18
i love this picture of them,1,27,6
adorable queen  lt 3,1,20,3
i love how she has pose by rihanna playing in the background,1,60,12
it s based off their billboard cover  ,1,38,6
lisa s bangs  jennie s petite look  and then process of elimination ,1,68,10
how can you tell when  they all have the same face  ,1,52,11
 meows in korean ,1,17,3
is it me or is jennie hinting something here  like a comeback hint  or maybe im just assuming things because im so excited for their comeback haha,1,146,27
what does it mean if a ticket says soundcheck on it  did i accidentally buy only soundcheck tickets or does that mean i get access to soundcheck and the actual concert  i m confused since it says soundcheck on it but not ga anywhere on the ticket  ordered off stubhub for reference,1,281,51
 [selling] two blackpink la tickets  section 233  row 3 seated next to each other  these are p3 tickets and i m selling both at face value  i can make the transaction through paypal goods and services  ,1,202,35

they better prepare for 1b because 4d doesn t seem to be slowing down    ,1,73,14
i think the latest 700m one is too perfunctory    they don t even use the special 4d font to stylise the 4d title    ,1,117,22
i like 500 the best,1,19,5
it s always jennie and friends nowadays   ,1,42,6
now its in our area,1,19,5
fingers crossed that happens on monday  c ,1,42,7
oh my jisoos she really knows how to pose and that gaze at the camera bishhhhh ,1,79,16
even twitter is a blink  ,1,25,5
okay good to know blackpink is still alive cauz noone is posting much lately which gets me even more hyped up for the comeback,1,126,24
they look like they r from the aang the last airbender damn,1,59,12
so awesome  i wish the other 3 were a bit more prominent though ,1,64,13
i think that would be good  ,1,28,7
and now you can buy tickets to the first show for 20 bucks ,1,59,13
she s wasting her talent modeling for this brand  give her a high profile brand yg   ,1,85,16
anyone notice she likes art museums  my kind of girl ,1,53,10
jennie what are thoooooooooooose  blackpink always be coming through with the questionable shoes lol ,1,101,14
does anyone actually know if soundcheck w  ga also gets early entry into the venue  or does vip get that kind of priority ,1,122,23
ah forgot that one ,1,19,4
jisoo dropping intellectual quote bombs all the time  ,1,54,9
how do you want the downvote button to be  the same as the upvote button  just the other way ,1,93,19
no  [this one]   he also didn t post  and it was a week ago ,1,60,13
average views are 1 4 1 8m a day and  47m in feb so sometime this year for sure ,1,80,16
nah he posted the other view milestones  just this one he s avoided or maybe he ll post it later who knows ,1,107,20
does anyone know that if the live band be performing together with blackpink for summer sonic tokyo 2019 ,1,105,18
omg even  twitter is a jisoo stan  ,1,35,7
shes so perfect    ,1,19,4
finally   someone recognizes jisoo    ,1,38,4
i have vip blink package for 5 8 at fort worth for sell and premium axs floor ga  i got tickets for 5 9 and am selling my tickets for 5 8 ,1,138,29
but he also didn t post a poster for the last youtube milestone  and that was before he stopped posting altogether ,1,115,20
twitter has got some good tatste  we stan a legend stanning a legend,1,68,13
if the average for the next 300m views is 1 1m views a day  we should hit 1b in early december  it could happen much earlier though ,1,132,26
god jisoo   ,1,12,3
no  and i was initially worried because we have ga4  the system just needs to assign all ga tickets some random number  only vip package and ga sound check people get in earlier  aka be closer to the stage   the rest of us are in the same boat ,1,244,48
twitter standing talent yes,1,27,4
bow to your queen   ,1,20,5
this mv will hit 1b this year  now yg  please give us a teaser for bp comeback already  ,1,88,18
we are not worthy ,1,18,4
 gt  maybe he doesn t want to get swarmed with questions about the comeback he doesn t want to get swamped with question about seungri or tax evasion i would have to guess  ,1,173,31
you re right  there s not much of a demand  fort worth still has a lot of tickets available for their second night  ,1,116,21
pretty sure other groups like bts have already reached 1b views,1,63,11
 lisa top left jisoo top right jennie bottom left rose bottom right ,1,68,12
is there any difference between getting a ga floor ga1 and a ga9 ticket  ,1,73,14
yes my lovelies        ,1,23,4
the revolution    ,1,18,2
they are on pace to be the first k pop group to reach 1b views ,1,63,14
on international women s day too  legendary behaviour ,1,54,7
if anything this would be the one to post,1,41,9
ok  so yg has officially stopped posting these youtube milestone posters to his personal instagram account  i wonder why  maybe he doesn t want to get swarmed with questions about the comeback    but eh  i don t really know ,1,224,37
finally they have an unbreakable youtube record as just a group in general  not female group  we did it ,1,104,19
some tickets are going at 1 3 cost pretty wild  probably upgrading to sound check ,1,82,14
congratz ma girls   ,1,20,4
newark day 2 looks bad  and i mean real bad  it looks like they ve only sold 10 20  of tickets  might be less if you factor in bots scalpers   just hoping that the comeback will generate enough spark so they don t cancel the 2nd show ,1,234,43
what s the eta for 1b ,1,22,5
blackpink blackpink blackpink blackpink k now teasers ,1,54,7
my girls   ,1,11,3
i got tickets to day 2 of the ft worth concerts yesterday  if you go to axs website  there are still a ton of unsold seats  i would guess around 70  or more unsold    should i be worried that yg might cancel the day 2 concert ,1,226,46
the outfit is not that flattering but she makes it look flawless ,1,65,12
olensglobal  i ve tried before and can t open the website for some reason  i will try again once i have access to a desktop i guess  thanks  ,1,141,26
just the olens english website ,1,31,5
legs    legs for daaaaaays,1,26,5
actually i got a fedex tracking email now and is set for delivery on the 14th  ,1,79,16
i also want to point out  fort worth s 2nd date curretnly is not sold out at all  there s actually a ton of seats available at cost  ,1,133,26
who is who ,1,11,3
where did you order from  i ve tried most of the cruum collection and absolutely loved it  but can t find olens for sale here    ,1,129,24
give them some down time from the first stretch of their tour  ,1,63,12
definitely   ,1,13,2
of course  to me she s perfection  just this smile really caught my eye   ,1,74,14
lisa s just so pretty in general   ,1,35,7
is there anything she can t pull off ,1,37,7
i was unable to initially get tickets due to the resell bots buying a crazy amount to day 1 of the ft worth concert  yesterday  day 2 tickets went on sale and i was easily able to get them  but there are now a huge amount of below face value re sell tickets to day 1 and a ton of completely unsold day 2 tickets  i hope yg doesn t cancel day 2   hopefully the comeback and coachella will drive up interest in the concert ,1,421,82
nope   ,1,7,2
this has shaken me to my core  i actually got emotional ,1,56,11
i agree with everything you said  but when they release new material    i think that will be what propels them forward or causes their popularity to fade  the next releases will be critical in making sure they re here to stay  ,1,227,40
she s so cuteee,1,15,3
i m willlng to bet whoever wrote this is an english major,1,57,11
eeeeee thanks  i actually didn t see that you replied  i came back here just to stare at your art some more    ,1,111,22
the fact that ros  hasn t posted since she last did in a hair salon is a good sign  all the girls are pretty quiet on social media aside from jisoo saying that s she knows it s frustrating about the teasers  positive vibes     ,1,227,42
not epic unless it involves blackpink trashing one of their hotel rooms,1,71,12
real cool  i love these videos ,1,31,6
taaaake me hooooooooooooome ,1,28,3
i totally agree  just hoping i m right that they want to give rtee x anda some time to breath or maybe they want d4 to hit 700 mil first  i m just trying to remain positive ,1,173,35
so effortless  they defiantly broke the mould  ,1,47,7
i m sorry   lol ,1,16,4
thanks  although you did kill a bit of my optimism  ,1,52,10
they released a release calendar  let me get a link  ,1,53,10
i honestly believe that they are giving the rtee x anda track some time in the spotlight before they start releasing teasers for bp  also isn t mamamoo that are releasing teasers for their comeback on the 14th  momoland is only being reported as the 20th  no teasers yet  if there are teasers i can t find them  ,1,312,56
ooosh  purdy ,1,13,2
jheeze    ,1,10,2
thank you     photoshop cc and wacom intuos pro ii medium,1,57,11
i m not    generalizing    or even being mean jfc i just said i never saw someone mention it besides defending her  ,1,116,18
personally it was just a witchhunt  jennie did look uninterested in some clips  but the clips people were showing were the same clips and it only showed what  maybe less than 3 minutes of their concert  when their concert was 2 hours long  jennie deserved some criticism  but a lot of it was too much and not even constructive tbh  after that jennie improved  but people still see her as  lazy  which just shows that people see only what they want to see tbh ,1,459,83
never see blackpink fans be willing to have a discussion about this  not to be rude  but if you took 2 seconds to search the sub for  lazy  or another network relating to this topic  you d find many people have asked the same question and many people have answered ,1,265,49
yes im a bit nervous too because of the news popping up  i hope bp will not be affected by this especially their upcoming comeback,1,130,25
for me it s all nonsense  it s just a witchhunt  it all happened once she released solo and i guess some fans didn t like the success she had got for the song as it did do better than other songs during a stacked november  it s not a case of defending her for some actions  it s a case of people just being plain mean to someone who hasn t done anything wrong in the first place ,1,379,73
anyone else getting a bit nervous about the state of yg since all these news is coming out about him  if true  hopefully he will just get a hefty fine but worst case scenario he gets locked up i wonder what will happen  maybe teddy will take over management of bp  the timing of all this just sucks ,1,299,58
if this whole drama gets worse and worse and it starts going downhill  i would hope yg would step down ,1,103,20
every blink hopes so,1,20,4
earlier this year there was a viral tweet that someone posted pictures of filming here  it was rumored that bp had just finished filming their music video  ,1,156,27
your application is so smooth    what s your secret   also did you use photoshop  illustrator  or procreate  i m obsessed with this piece and it s texture  ,1,156,26
this is the hotel where they filmed seungri s where are you from music video and held some of the great seungri promotional events  ,1,132,23
i really hope yg s scandals doesn t affect bp s comeback,1,56,9
no one knows    ,1,16,3
that s why i am saying yg is always a jerk imo  people just can t get what he is even thinking about his artists  bp definitely deserves much better and they can go even further without yg strange and nonsense managements ,1,222,40
we already know it s an advertisement but i wonder if it will tie in with some comeback material ,1,97,18
teasers need to start coming out for the comeback or else i m going to start getting nervous  i m afraid that all this yg drama is pushing it back  but they don t have time to push it back  they barely have time for the comeback anyways  ,1,238,45
this is amazing  ,1,17,4
am i really the first person to     okay then  take me down to paradise city where the grass is green and blackpink is prettaaay ,1,129,24
damn  i just fell in love,1,25,6
maybe an advertisement about the hotel,1,38,6
i hope she uploads the whole thing  even lisa s dropping teasers before bp    ,1,78,14
i m guessing it has something to do with their comeback and the hotel ,1,70,13
i was sceptical about this comeback  i really did think we ll be blessed with a comeback in the summer of 2019  with jisoo s update hope has arisen  however  i feel like yg might push it a bit again and it will happen on the 30th or 31st of march  and let s not forget that lisa s birthday is just around the corner  \^\^,1,321,62
when her youtube channel videos have an earlier teaser than their group s comeback ,1,83,13
lili in lilifilm  finally ,1,26,4
 i have p2 reserved aisle seats for pretty much face and fees and a tiny profit  375 for two aisle seats row 6 rows from first  they cost  363 direct from axs so you re not overpaying at all,1,190,38
cant believe i thought paradise city was an artist or a musical group  and really tried to stalk this  group  only to find its a hotel     so im guessing this  epic collab  is related to the shoot they did back in nov    amp  x200b ,1,232,45
lalisa manoban you smile  we smilee,1,35,6
thankyou  there s a facevalue ticket i m looking at on gumtree  australian craigslist  i just wish it was a physical ticket ,1,124,20
show em your jawline  or your highlightah,1,41,7
i read this on twitter last night  it gave me goosebumps ,1,57,11
i think it means that some events  most likely related to comeback  will be held in one of the hotels or venues owned by the paradise city corporation,1,150,28
epic collab    with a hotel ,1,28,5
good job,1,8,2
do it  give me your resolution and ill make it right for you  d ,1,64,14
why yall r so talented jeez,1,27,6
omg so adorable   amazing ,1,26,4
this is from the instagram account of [andrew oh]   the chief of future strategic planning of the paradise group h q  ,1,118,20
video doesn t [work]   probably only japan users ,1,49,7
[instagram source]    amp  x200b  [paradise city korea official website]  ,1,74,8
i read this with a friend last night  at the discord of blackpink  we were so amazed  lmao  tbh didn t expect any meaning behind the m v just thought the props were amazing ,1,173,32
stay has been one of my favorite mvs songs  i ve always had so many questions about it and what it meant  this is the best theory and i want it to be true  it s perfect  ,1,170,34
i sincerely hope that they could have music that touch on social and political topics in the future  and not just love  relationship or things related to romance again and again  for instance  the one featuring jisoo tripping down in the 4d mv is a smart idea and i look forward to seeing more concepts similar to that ,1,319,58
i highly suspect that this is because yg is tackling seungri scandal and related lawsuits  i don t want to think it that way but this should be the truth  very likely ,1,167,31
 u know people always like to drag blackpink for having shallow and meaningless musical content   of course compared to some groups  they do not really touch on social and political topics  and distinctively connect all their music videos with hidden theories  but i feel like alot of the blackpink mvs are overlooked  and one case is here stay  a beautiful yet heartbreaking story but is labeled the  that underrated blackpink song with campfire vibe  pretty pastel aesthetics  sometimes  another example could be  whistle   i read this theory with game console and the fish tanks about how blackpink is being controlled in a game and even though the theory was not perfect  it still gave me a new outlook on whistle s mv  also saw another  playing with fire  theory about rosie  jisoo and jennie being lisa s emotions in a toxic relationship  and was quite surprised  so what im trynna say is that  blackpink s mvs depend on how you look at them  if you would wanna keep them as  ligh hearted mvs with pretty and talented girls and with catchy beats  and iconic lines  or actually try to connect each set props and lyrics  and the color contrasts  or just simply read already written hidden theories  is purely your decision  i personally think there is a reason for each scene in blackpink s mvs to be chosen by the producers and directers  even though sometimes i cannot connect them ,1,1388,235
gah  still no confirmed date for the comeback ,1,46,8
wow  thank you so much for all that information  transportation to and within the city didn t even cross my mind yet  so all of that info will be extremely helpful  i m checking out hotels now and i like your idea of getting a nicer room  albeit further away from the venue  since i ll be going all around town anyways to check out those places you mentioned  much appreciated,1,376,68
yes    south east asia fanbase is really huge    just like what you said i think that these youtube views are somewhat  illusional  which when such  illusional  forces integrate with yg s strange thoughts     sigh,1,213,33
they didn t update ch  as often as before  i think it s not worth it to get it now  there s nothing updated there that worth it recently  but since you re korean  i guess it s ok to get it  expected that only jisoo update or chat in ch   you can chat with them but not personally  you have to spam the chat box to get them to notice you  that s tip is given by jisoo herself  ,1,376,75
thanks for the info  i bought my ticket from stubhub  hopefully it s not invalid    so excited for the concert  ,1,112,20
i know for sure there is some fandoming streaming going on  i m just not sure the fandom is capable of stream at this level for this long  maybe the sea fanbase is a lot bigger than i thought  so that could be the cause ,1,220,44
that theory is so well executed  i loved every word,1,51,10
sellers and buyers are engaged in a game of chicken right now  so there s little exchange  about a week before the show there will be a lot of panic selling  with sellers willing to sell at a loss rather than have to eat the tickets  many are professional scalpers who would never go to any of these concerts   one thing that could go in sellers  favor is how strong of a comeback this expected march comeback is  if tons of new songs  or rose s solo  combined with positive buzz at their first na show  coachella   this could fuel hype curiosity and sellers will hold firm on price confident they will sell ,1,608,110
omfggg this is amazing ,1,23,4
so what do you think regarding all these youtube views of bp ,1,61,12
anybody s billboard box set ship   it s been a minute and no shipping confirmation,1,82,14
yes   i m so excited for this  also  she was just hilarious  like usual   in the chatroom lol  i loved reading all her jokes playing around with the fans    jisoo cracks me up ,1,176,33
very different  yet somehow easily recognizable,1,47,6
holy shit this is incredible  ,1,30,5
[  oops wrong link   ,1,21,4
i hope i live to see the day where 4d surpasses gangnam style as the most viewed kpop video,1,91,19
to me she has a bit of a baby face ,1,35,10
despacito is up to 6 billion views  i really don t think that many people have watched the video  ,1,98,18
that s true  that made me feel better  thank you ,1,49,9
i honestly wouldn t recommend suffering through the ga line  we re talking a day camping in advance  and then the ga floor  some people have the energy  but imo p1 is the way to go ,1,181,34
haha rose and lisa actually acknowledge that in a vlive ,1,56,10
this looks very different from lisa    yet it is distinctly lisa  o,1,67,12
blackpink walter in your area is coming to europe ,1,50,9
nope  tax evasion in korea and the us are serious crimes  there might be a fine on top of jail time  but i believe that it is an incarceration moment  take abby lee miller for example  a successful women in tv and dance choreography  she went to jail for over 6 months for tax evasion on merchandise sales  i m not a lawyer i just live in the us and know ppl who have gone to jail for tax evasion  ,1,398,79
you are talented ,1,17,3
comment on this when you make a ros  i would love it as my background for my phone  ,1,84,18
she would definitely notice your enormous talent ,1,49,7
i don t think she s ever notice us mortals    ,1,46,9
that way we would have hit it two times though  not a bad story either  d anyway  i guess at that time today every video got views removed to make sure everything is legit  happens from time to time ,1,199,39
as far as i m concerned  every bp song from now on can be mostly all english  i just want to hear the original versions of all their songs  that s all    ,1,154,30
well at least they did this before we hit 700 mil  can you imagine if we had reached 700 mill and  then  they deleted a million views   that d be so anti climatic lmao,1,167,32
can someone send this to lisa because i would actually die just to see this look on her also  great job op  i really can t believe just how incredible this is   amp  x200b ,1,172,32
this  i was trying to discuss how this is kinda anomalous since the typical behavior for views versus time is logarithmic in nature  the fact that the views are going down a steady rate instead of drastic drops implies a more linear relationship but i was told that this was simply due to fandom streaming  in a nother subreddit  and it that it means nothing  which i think is too simple of an explanation ,1,406,74
it was very easy  makes me nervous this one won t sell out the way may 1 did  ,1,78,17
there s a difference between unique views and total views unique views basically represent an individual person s first view of it and is representative of how many individual people stream the song total views  which is what youtube counts  can be the same 100 million people listening to the song 7 times   for example so to answer your question   yes all your views count  ,1,376,65
woah that s great ,1,18,3
was it just me or was it way easier getting tickets for this date than wednesday   i managed to get 3 tickets in the good p3 section within 10 minutes,1,150,30
agreed  i was able to get the tickets in good seats as opposed to last time i couldn t get any  just super happy i get to go ,1,125,27
does youtube count really work like that  i thought that each viewer  or ip adress  would only count towards one view regardless of how many times you watch the video  i stream it a lot nontheless just because i love the songs  but does it really affect the view count ,1,269,50
well damn  _ ,1,13,3
wow  that was such much less stressful than the first go around  so excited to be seeing bp two days in a row  ,1,111,23
kinda regretting the tickets i bought for 153 with fees and i am seeing ga tickets for 145 on stubhub    ,1,105,20
all i know is they read and respond to the message from the live chat which is pretty cool  never really used it though tbh ,1,124,25
i paid like  205 fees for my p1 seated  i wouldnt even give 5 more bucks for this seat  i m sure prices are gonna drop it s just those damn scalpers,1,148,28
thanks  it s nice to see that jisoo is always updating ch   i was debating whether i should get it or not but i didn t cause there weren t many updates  but i might get it know  do you know if you can chat directly with the members  ,1,233,46
holy ros   this is so good  ,1,28,6
not really other than stubhub is strictly for resale tickets whereas ticketmaster does both  i ve purchased from stubhub with no issues in the past and they guarantee you 100  back if it s not valid i think ,1,207,36
bad bot,1,7,2
  is where i usually get my info  it also shows the views that i posted about originally so views definitely were deleted,1,121,22
try choicemusicla if you re in the states  they don t sell all bp merch  but they have lightsticks  shipping is also better than international price  ,1,150,24
hope this helps [  ,1,19,4
must be why lisa likes her so much  ,1,36,9
i really like to block fill the base lip color  then use soft brush to apply the gloss  which bleeds into the skin tone and makes it soft,1,137,28
yes     ,1,8,2
haha  yes   lt 3,1,16,3
  yes they did delete views  they did so for a lot of kpop videos at the same time though  have to make sure the videos are legit to get the ad money ,1,150,32
this is insane    how does one get on this level  i got into drawing a few months ago and [drew lisa for practice]   a few days ago  what resources did you use  and how do you get lips to blend so smoothly with her skin   ,1,222,46
 it took        10 days to get to 100m views 24 days to get from 200m from 100m 35 days to get from 300m from 200m 43 days to get from 400m from 300m 50 days to get from 500m from 400m 50 days to get from 600m from 500m 56 days     to get from 700m from 600m  i figure on 3 10  slowing down a bit  but 4d is quite the juggernaut ,1,329,75
i love you both,1,15,4
i love your art style omg,1,25,6
hmmmm  then they definitely deleted views ,1,42,6
this is amazing  are you planning on doing the other members as well ,1,69,13
wait wtf lol me too    it was at 697 94 or something when i checked ,1,68,15

can you send me the original photo  i m korean so i understand it ,1,66,13
4d really is the revolution,1,27,5

manchester still has tickets  if i get my bonus and it isn t swallowed up by bills i will be looking to get myself there ,1,121,24
i m in two minds about this  if we want bp to be huge in the west  especially the usa  that will require lots of english lyrics  i would love it if americans would recognize korean  and japanese for that matter  as the totally beautiful awesome singing language that it is  but we all know it s going to be almost impossible for a foreign language song to be popular in america  somebody mentioned in a previous post  if a foreign language song could make it big in america  you d see lots of spanish language songs  but you don t   for me personally  i definitely prefer what they are doing now  korean  and japanese   with some english thrown in here and there so i can actually sing along  jennie rapping in korean is just so fucking awesome to my ears ,1,756,137
have fun mate ,1,14,3
 i keep it lit like a matchstick ,1,33,7
she absolutely stunning  such a beauty    i can t wait to see them in may  ,1,75,15
why not in new york    ,1,23,5
guys  at what time cb teasers are usually posted   yes  im waiting ,1,67,12
how are they being biased  i mean it s a fact that bp bad 2ne1 are different groups with different approaches to the girl crush concept,1,135,25
some people are just waiting for extra tour dates too  so they have a chance to pay normal price  those who couldn t will most likely wait to last minute when resellers have to lower price near concert time ,1,207,38
very much so yes  ,1,18,4
they re being rushed because big bang is in the army and yg needs money ,1,72,14
agree with the teasers  will definitely hype up anyone who was iffy on going based on their small discography,1,109,19
there is huge demand for the seats  i dont think there will be a problem with the venue filling up by the time the actual concert rolls around  the problem is that the ticket prices originally were already higher than usual other kpop acts  especially with the small discography  i know many people just waiting for the ticket prices to drop back to around original price  the problem is that the original price was already high  so people aren t gonna throw out more than double or sometimes triple the original amount when ticket resellers are decreasing prices daily  since these are also all resell tickets  yg isnt too pressured to push ticket sales because for them  they are already all sold out  i have a feeling if whygee actually dropped some teasers  the ball will get rolling filling up those resell tickets ,1,820,142
this is not something new  this happens to all major concerts  events  they will sell when the tour dates get closer  people are just waiting since they don t wanna get gouged and know resellers will like usual panic near the concert date and drop the price down of tickets  again  this is not something new ,1,308,55
that smile anytime    ,1,22,4
yes    what you are describing here are exactly what the haters and many more who dislikes yg are criticising and mocking right now  like many reporters and some blinks  mostly rational blinks i think  like those in reddit   i think bp is being pushed a bit too rush  in terms of tours ,1,286,52
you re definitely not alone  she made this angry cat face that first time they went on weekly idol and i wish she would do it again these days ,1,143,28
it is under suspicion but most likely to be confirmed  the club that yhs owns is apparently legally listed as a  restaurant  not  nightclub  and so for however long that club has been operating  it s been paying much lowet taxes   restaurant rate is 10  while nightclub is 23   yhs might weasel his way out of incarceration by paying fine but he did techinacally tax evade ,1,373,66
you can tell that jisoo is shining brighter then the sun  ,1,58,12
jisoo s slight pause is so adorable ughhhh,1,42,7
in the channel  bp is not really active in posting and they seldom have live but i think is because they are busy with their comeback and tours  maybe you can try subscribe for a month and see whether you like it or nah  maybe they will post once in awhile      ,1,262,52
this photo of her is absolutely stunning ,1,41,7
sooo i am deciding to sub to the ch  channel or nah  do they post often     ,1,76,17
i think it implies that the teaser  but not mv  should be ready,1,63,13
i understand that  i maybe should have phrased this differently  however  these rumours have been coming from blogs  and certain threads  not official websites   from as far as ive known rn   but from people who usually write about these situations    its been said that yg might     i never mentioned it had to be of an actual source or website  im just stating an innocent question considering the recent backlash with seungri  i was also wondering whether it connected or not  the use   its been said   can mean it came from any source  whether it was a comment or a website  theres no specific way to write it  i can even write it as sources state that    and it would give the same outcome  i do believe that people should however take a chill pill with this situation when it doesnt revolve around them or possibly take a step back and realise that the evidence proven is extremely weak and unreliable as of far  ,1,919,170
 gt it s been said that yg might have to go to jail for supposedly tax envasion  that is the start of your post  there is no news site stating that  the only people stating that are anti yg people and they are using this to try to attack blackpink and other artists over this  it s possible you are asking an innocent question but using rumor with  it s been said  with no source article implies the same nefarious intent as everyone on social media celebrating as you describe  first seungri was guilty  then innocent  then guilty of something else  now yg is guilty  but no one claiming these people are guilty has actual evidence  they are jumping to conclusions based upon partial info leaks  this is why leaks during criminal investigations are bad  now if someone is actually innocent  everyone will assume they bought their innocence because of these partial info leaks that imply guilt  conversely  if someone is charged with real evidence  those thinking they are innocent will claim they only charged them because they had to charge somebody after all this noise ,1,1073,181

the translation on vlive is so bad but ya saw her asked us to prepare for the teasers,1,85,18
ever since bts got popular in the west their fandom has gotten so toxic  i m not saying all of them are but since the fandom is so huge the immature ones outweighs the good ones  it s honestly sad to see bcuz bts s message is loving yourself and they even had a speech about bullying  but their immature fans hate on anyone that sees any semblance of success in the west  you can go on twitter on billboards  tweets talking about bp and you ll see how much they hate on bp  they even accused the journalist of being bribed by yg  they called jennie lazy  called bp disrespectful  and criticize everything the girls do  they re more up to date than blinks are on bp s schedule  i personally just try to ignore it knowing you can t change these peoples minds  they truly believe that only their faves can succeed and if anyone else does it threatens the success of there s  one thing that does drive me crazy is when bp achieve something  they always try to downplay degrade it or say that yg paid for it  it s really getting tiring but idc  i ll support bp through whatever happens  ,1,1082,195
i hope that doesn t mean 2030,1,29,6

im not an anti yg stan or whatever  im purely asking a question since ive been seeing people on social medias celebrating yg   going to jail   so i had no clue whether it was false or not  its amazing how you took my words out of context ,1,238,48
thank god  ive been seeing people celebrate   yg going to jail   on social media and it kinda freaked me out considering i knew that there wasnt any evidence technically shown to us as of yet but people were so happy to throw him out and let their groups go to psy ent  i was honestly baffled tbvh ,1,298,59
i agree with the overall sentiment that we can t fight hate with hate  on the other hand  i feel like we re putting way too much value into the opinions of others  we simply cannot convert people who have an inherent bias against a certain genre or group  we come across as abrasive and just push people the wrong way  i think us as fans are putting way too much emphasis on validating blackpink as the  1 group in the world  the fact that they ve made it this far is amazing and should be applauded  can they be more successful  sure  but i feel like it further divides our young fandom from appreciating blackpink as artists and musicians and more as a group that puts out good numbers on the charts  don t get me wrong  i despise the shit other fandoms fling against blackpink and blinks  just plain misinformation into slut shaming  etc  but as i ve become older  i just realize that shit is just short term pain and it s simply not worth my time  the only thing i can do to defend something is to call them out on misinformation  i feel like blinks in general are so obsessed with this sort of validation that we end up trying so hard to fight hate with hate and never are on the same page  it sucks to constantly be hated on by other fandoms  but i really try to go into the mindset of just enjoying blackpink for their music and personalities  despite the infrequent releases  let that stuff speak for itself on the charts  ,1,1431,262
this hurt so much to read   i understand how some people feel like it wasn t their best performance  but a lot of it was just hate  why do people feel the need to comment on a group they don t like  like i m not a fan of bts    but i don t go to their videos and say blackpink is better or anything  i don t even watch the videos  if they don t like the girls then why watch their every move  why can t they just let us like what we want  i noticed a lot if hate recently  i say a thread for unpopular kpop opinions and the was a lot of bp hate  i don t understand  i really hope the girls don t see ,1,600,122
lmao me too ,1,12,3
honestly i wouldn t pay too much attention to it  what was it  2 years ago  where hans zimmer played coachella and everyone had their knickers in a twist because  no one wants to hear classic music at a festival  well he came in and played inception  dark knight  pirates of the caribbean  lion king etc with his band and blew everyone away  people will gripe and complain because that s just what they do to keep busy  just go  enjoy the show or watch the show online and don t worry  they ll have a blast ,1,507,93

i have such a problem with them saying it s weird to be into music in a language they don t understand  wtf   remember that scene from bohemian rhapsody when everyone at the rio concert knew all the lyrics even though the brazilians didn t speak english  music is a universal language  and it s arrogantly eurocentric  i e  english gt everything   when mexicans and japanese fell in love with the beatles in the 60s  were they called weirdos ,1,442,72

  going from melbourne airport to the city is about a 30 minute bus ride  you ll want a skybus ticket  they re slightly cheaper online  [    southbank at night would be good for photos of the city   there s a free tram to get around the city  you ll need a myki transport card  from 7 11 or convenience store  to explore beyond the city on a tram   find a good hotel  there s a few crappy ones around the venue  to be honest  i ve stayed at the mantra nearby and although it s super convenient to walk to and from the show  i wish i spent the money on a better hotel in the city and paid the  10 for an uber to get there and back    coffee is melbourne s speciality  cafe culture plays a significant part in everyone s lifestyles here so you ll always find a great place to eat  laneway greens is one of my favourite places for breakfast and smoothies    only thing to be conscious of is respecting indigenous culture  without being too political  australia has a dark past and we should be as respectful of indigenous people as possible  for example  you shouldn t play a didgeridoo  one direction had a scandal for doing this on stage a few years ago   i m not really sure of rules around boomerangs but it s worth being conscious of as well  you d have no problems buying one from any tourist shop  but i m not sure if they re legitimate or not  i know you re not necessarily planning to go to uluru  but if you do  please research how to be respectful there as it s very sacred land   amp  x200b  i m afraid i don t know about day trips to take to see victoria s outback as i m from sydney and am only flying to melbourne for the show  but if you have any other questions  feel free to pm me anytime ,1,1704,315

do you think a second la show is possible  or is that too busy with coachella on 4 12 and 4 19  i also strongly think they ll do a talk show performance on the 15th or 16th  kimmel or ellen  ,1,191,38
i m going to coachella and yea i agree it s kinda worrying but i m sure it s just the vocal minority  lots of people will definitely be interested in at least checking them out,1,176,32
i m just going off what i know from what i ve read to my own experiences to answer your question  i m doing vip for fort worth  from what i understand  soundcheck ga and vip go in for soundcheck at some point in the early afternoon  then after soundcheck  everyone leaves again  then vip has early entry and enters before everyone else to get a place on the floor merchandise shop etc  as far as the merchandise  i don t know when they ll be giving it to us  i m guessing it s when we check in  usually vip is will call  but i have an actual ticket on the app so idk  but there will be an email sent out a few days before the show so we ll know what we need to by the date  as far as transferring  i m not sure if that ll work without contacting the company which sold you the tickets  ticketmaster axs  so you can transfer the name to someone else  because usually it goes by the name on the credit card used  so i wouldn t do anything without contacting the ticket website first ,1,981,182

i ve learned over time that you can t change everyone s minds even if you state facts  bp was and is inevitably bound to get opinions that you may or may not agree with  it s better if you just enjoy the content and avoid comment sections at all costs  ,1,253,47
i think that is true to some degree  but the majority of the hate just steams from jealousy  you don t get jealous of someone who isn t doing anything  or isn t accomplishing anything  if you re going to hate  might as well hate the one on the top  and that is blackpink  they make it an easy target because they re from yge  but don t get it twisted  people ain t hating on lee hi  or soohyun from akmu  even though they re from yge  they re hating blackpink because they have achieved a level of success that is truly unprecedented  at least for how young they are in the game  less then 3 years  and getting all of the accolades  that is getting haters pressed  because get s what  you re hating on them  you re saying all of these bad things  and yet they re breaking records  from achieving platinum on gaon  to be awfully close to get their on platinum in the u s a with streams  dddd is extremely close to reach 700 million  i believe within this year  they re getting their first billion views mv  this new comeback is only gonna make them reach further  and solidify their names as powerhouses  which they already are  they re touring the world with about 10 songs  that is insane  when you think about it  ,1,1216,214

if you re short i would avoid unless you re ok with tall people being in front of you  there s people who get mad they can t see but you need to be aware it s something that can happen and they don t have to move so you can see if they don t want to  ga can get a little rowdy not because people are jumping around but because everyone is pushing forward  and then people start pushing back and it gets really chaotic  it kinda simmers down as the show progresses though ,1,471,89

i ve never had a problem with ga before but some factors to consider  i m 5 5  and i ve only been to rock shows  i d say being smaller  than 30yr old men  allowed me to move ahead as well and not many of them shove  aside from mosh circle   i do get the feeling that because blackpinks fanbase is a lot younger  a lot of them will be pushing shoving towards the front  if you don t mind being in the back  there s usually a lot of standing room and still an exciting experience  personally i think its better but only if you weren t able to get one of the front row seating on the sides  ,1,588,112
sure  i meant changing to the new reddit for good to always see the upvote buttons here hehe  looks good ,1,105,20
she s so adorable  i m bisexual for lisa   ,1,43,8
depends on the stage and where you re positioned and what type of show  i personally prefer being on the floor than in the seats for a regular concert  like if its a rock band i prefer standing room because you re up close and you can dance around and move around and whatever sparks joy  but if i m going to see like a solo singer  i ll take seats as i can just sit back and enjoy  i personally would ve loved to have floors for bp but there was no way i could shell out that cash ,1,482,95
i really hope she switches up the songs  maybe does some western music covers  ,1,79,14
are you short  prepared to be standing on your toes the whole time  i personally don t like ga floor  i m only 5 4 and i hate having to constantly look around people and stand on my toes  some people love ga floor because it s a mini party but i m not a fan  ,1,259,51

they use    to make certain products seem more high quality foreign  in this particular case    actually sounds more natural because its followed by serum         is definitely much more commonly used  no one actually refers to water as    ,1,240,41

they released english songs is what i m saying  full english ,1,61,10
kind of off topic  but if anyone is korean and runs into this post  could you potentially explain why a word like  water  is phonetically english in a korean ad  i can understand concepts that arose post language inception  such as the word serum right after it   but are koreans also implementing common words like water as phonetic replacements  first result that pops up for water is    is that not more commonly used ,1,421,73
i ve got some extra tickets for section 115 if anybody is interested  face value only  can meet in person ,1,106,19
well first you should wait until there is enough evidence and legal actions are actually taken  no need to freak out already  right now there is simply a lot of bad publicity and investigation starts to arise  what is the most concerning at this state to me is that the general public will get a more negative opinion on yg in general and that alone might lead to a bp comeback which doesn t do as well as it could  but we will see what will happen  cannot really change it one way or another anyway  if yg has skeletons in the closet then there should be consequences for him  this won t really change too much about the company itself most likely though  ,1,657,122
did you accidentally post your anti yg bs here in  instead of the usual  dumping ground   amp  x200b  if you want to know about korean laws  prosecutors  cops  their no jury trials  and more  just read about the conviction of tiger jk  a rival  failed rapping group  was caught doing drugs and agreed to prosecutors demands to lie and say tiger provided them and did the drugs with them  hair samples proved he hadn t done any drugs in the last 6 months and the dates they claim he provided drugs to them were proven false when his passport showed he was in the us for months  so prosecutors changed the date they claimed to an earlier time when he was still in korea  since there was no jury and anti americanism was high  he was convicted with falsified evidence  [tiger jk conviction   source article]    amp  x200b  it s amazing how no one wants to wait until actual  real evidence is released before making stupid claims of guilt ,1,935,162

in one of the recent english language magazine interviews  they said the original versions of their songs they worked on with teddy started out in english before being converted to korean  so it would not be anglicizing the songs but reverting to their original form  however  they also said those early demos were terrible in comparison to their song s final form  that is easily believable as the english rap lyrics in the japanese versions of their songs are a bit cringe y  but we know they can have great english raps like aiiyl  seeing the end product of the japanese conversions makes me doubt we see full english versions  i can see maybe as much as a 50 50 split of korean and english songs on their future albums with interscope s involvement  ,1,754,129
i have plenty of experience with them when i was trying to buy tickets for the atlanta show  they are to be avoided if at all possible  their credit card processing system is absolute sh t  after multiple tries over multiple days  i gave up trying to get them to accept any of my credit cards and instead bought the tickets off of stubhub for  30 over face value  the cards weren t declined as a pending charge always showed up on my cc card  it would simply say  there has been an error processing the transaction  or something like that  you can see some of my rants in the atlanta section of the concert thread ,1,614,114
i honestly see ppl jumping to conclusions at this point because they all hope he goes to jail  which bewilders me   because at least he didnt do murder   well as of yet   but considering they r doing this while covering another issue abt the sopa situation at hand  all seems funny  and suspicious to me ,1,304,58
to be quite frank i wouldnt believe this either considering this whole situation seems to be just another cover up over a larger situation with sopa  if yg plays with the media then im pretty sure the principal of sopa did just that ,1,233,43
only a fine even for tax evasion   ,1,35,8
even if it turns out to be true  which i doubt  it s gonna be a fine and that s it  not this jail nonsense  ,1,108,23
i think many people also hope that yg falls down  but it wouldn t surprise me if it turns out to be true ,1,105,22
yhs will go to jain as much as messi and ronaldo or any other rich person who has been involved in tax fraud   which is none and accept a fine instead  btw as far as i know he s or rather the club i guess  are only  under suspicion  of tax evasion which means nothing is confirmed  i d say a lot of the jail talk is bait considering seungri s situation atm ,1,357,68
if they go under black label  they d be treated better for sure ,1,64,12
right  his art skills are pretty amazing  he has a lot of videos on his channel that are pretty unbelievable  ,1,110,20
aw she looks so cute here  lt 3 ,1,32,7
yg deserves it  in an ideal situation  girls would sign with someone else,1,73,13
this frankly sounds like some smear tactics and click bait journalism  wouldn t believe it until police are actually at his doors ,1,130,21
wow  this person is better with a pencil than i am with a camera ,1,65,14
yay  i had decided on the other set  the bottle was too adorable to pass  i didn t know hmv had a discount  good find  now we wait ,1,131,27
is she trying to kill us all ,1,29,7
this is the worst scenario but i really hope that the artists do good  no matter what  yg is a jerk imo ,1,104,22
i really do hope that if everything goes wrong  the black label can take them up   esp if yg doesnt want another person to sharehold onto the entertainment  ,1,157,30
the company will be taken over by whoemever yg or the other shareholders appoint   depending on how deep the company is and if there will be action taken to the entirety of yg s assets or what    but the artists and acts are just innocent employees    bp will be fine maybe everyone will get managed by the black label now take every speculation with grain of salt idk anything abt law ,1,386,69
i really want to buy it but i am personally saving money right now for whenever their comeback is so that i can buy their albums haha,1,133,27
i agree with you  and if they had that strategy in mind  they would ve tested the waters by singing in english on colbert and gma  what i m curious about  is whether they ll be influenced by the more rowdy crowd at coachella and push the envelope more  i m not expecting jennie to scream  coachella  make some fuckiiiiiiing noiiiiiiiiiiissssseeeee   but somewhat going in the opposite direction compared to how they toned it down in indonesia malaysia ,1,452,73
 gt  she hasn t appeared on chanel instagram nor website either   now tell me why the ambassador still hasn t make her appearance on the brand s sns yet  i thought i d revisit this thread  here you go she s on [channel official instagram]   along with kristen stewart who s a famous house ambassador for chanel  jennie s caption   gt    house ambassador   jennie kim attended the  chanelinthesnow show at the grand palais in paris earlier today  kristen s caption   gt    house ambassador   kristen stewart in the snowy landscape of the  chanelfallwinter 2019 20 show in paris   chanelinthesnow  chanel  pfw  kristenstewart ,1,624,93
i m selling one ticket  sec 104 first row  i got earlier because i managed to get ga later  it s listed for the lowest price allowed by ticket master   amp  x200b  it s been there for 2 days  come on blinks please take it ,1,222,41
correct me if i m wrong  jennie took this photo of lisa at the taipei concert with lisa s camera  [source]  ,1,108,19
well no one knows the english lyrics to bp songs in the first place  they only sing it a their japanese concerts ,1,113,22
they re going to do great and did great  not an issue  did the shows sell out  not entirely  ticketmaster has this  dynamic pricing  for platinum seats  where they literally held onto seats floor ga just to sell it at a markup depending on the demand how many people were looking  so  while the public sale cheap seats are all gone more or less  the venues at best are not going to be full like some other acts may be  a lot of people were looking to scalp and you can see floor ga going for under retail closer to the day  as of right now  there are still over 800 tickets listed for floor ga for the la show  and seats have already fallen to  160   40 under ,1,660,125
worked fine for red velvet  the crowd was able to sing along in the concert with the english versions of their songs lol ,1,121,23
i think the reason why they didn t use the english ver  of the raps duirng gma and the late show was because of the language  like the rap parts do include some words that you will not hear on u s  tv programs       forever young  performance on gma made me believe in this more when they just cut out the rap part  well there was  says life s a b\ \ \  but mine s a movie    so  i think for the concert  they might use the english rap parts  again  since they said in their interview with billboard  jennie and lisa sometimes mix up the the rap parts between korean and japanese ver   japanese ver  has english part   they may end up using the korean ver  too ,1,661,123
they should sing in korean  japanese  and english to trigger everyone ,1,70,11
goddess  that s it  ,1,20,3
maybe they will combine the english rap into the korean versions ,1,65,11
wow why didn t this happen when they were here in malaysia  granted i managed to get tickets at a lower price but  100  200 difference is huge  ,1,144,26
ohh okay ty,1,11,3
i m checking that one right now and seeing p4 s for  30   i m actually considering buying one since that s basically half price  ,1,129,21
i don t have experience buying tickets from stubhub yet  but i sold two tickets there recently  for face value   had to provide my card to ensure buyer guarantee safety because there s fines for not delivering  additionally if the tickets are listed by the sellers as  have on hand  they have to be shipped out the day after purchase  or possibly face a late fine    i was paid a couple days after the tickets got delivered  the shipping label they provided also included tracking ,1,481,82
sounds good to me   ,1,20,4
doubt it  lmao  imagine how the tones would change so much  probably it s more like their cb will have a lot of english lyrics and jisoo singing the korean parts  just a prediction ,1,181,33
i doubt it  that strategy didn t work for previous girl groups who ve made a us push  so why would they emulate that  don t get me wrong  i fully expect them to really flex their english fluency in their next ep  but those will likely be built from the ground up that way  plus  bts made it big in the us by singing in korean  and while i hate the american media s description of blackpink as  the female version of bts   in this case  it s the only truly successful model out there  so i don t see why they wouldn t follow it ,1,527,100
highly doubt it  that was something i feared when they were performing on gma and the late show  but they stuck with their kr versions  ,1,136,25
i don t think they ll be doing english versions of their current library  though i wouldn t dismiss the possibility that they might integrate the english raps from the japanese versions of their songs  hopefully not 4d lol   new album is a different story  could see something similar to red velvet s kcon performance of bad boy where they do half of a song in korean and then debut an english version in the second half  honestly  it s an open question  this is uncharted territory honestly ,1,492,83
just an  educational  guess lmao because with these dates they ll be able to promote more or less 2 weeks before coachella  ,1,124,21
when people were upset about tickets being sold out  i was about the make a post telling them not to worry and that the prices would go down closer to the concert date  but then i realized i don t really know enough about the topic to say that for certain  i was mostly basing that on sports ticket prices  but it s good to know that for future ,1,345,67
new ep will probably feature english heavier songs which should fill their need for some english songs for the na tour  and thus no need to change any of the old material  ,1,172,32
no the seat number is just a formality  most big venues ga section will have a seat number but it s not important ,1,114,22
i don t know  i personally don t believe the whole  we don t hate bp  we just hate yg  excuse is really true  because ikon and winner don t get even nearly the amount of hate bp does    people  who hate on bp because of yg are just idiots    like the girls have nothing to do with his decisions and hating on unrelated people makes zero sense     but yeah the seungri thing sure isn t helping ,1,393,72
you must be tripping ,1,21,4
panic sell ,1,11,2
i think it s b c they added a 2nd show in newark which will be on sale tomorrow  ,1,81,17
chanel is lucky to have jennie   ,1,33,7
is this just a guess or based on something  i ll take anything lol i m so excited to finally get a real date  amp  then the comeback ,1,133,26
well the japanese versions are the ones that have those english heavy versus the op is talking about unless there s other ones    ,1,130,22
how about if they sing in japanese ,1,35,7
i think a lot of the hate for blackpink comes from people who dislike yg and this whole seungri scandal probably isn t going to help ,1,133,25
i saw the ga tickets for their nj show for   130 on stubhub as well    was wondering if it was legit  because the p1 ga  official price was  198  what s happening ,1,163,29
they [added]   another date for fort worth  sales start at march 7  maybe wait until then should drive the resale price down ,1,125,22
but next moment  she becomes a baby who grabs the hearts of all blinks  just too adorable ,1,90,17
any if y all have experience with axs  i checked recently and seats in p1 are still going  gt  400 on axs  i plan on going to the fort worth dallas concert so am i limited only to purchasing from axs ,1,200,38
and everyone here rumbling whether jennie was rich or something  i mean the girl knows how to ride horses  no one just learns riding horses  ,1,141,25
oh definitely  runway models aren t prioritized based on attractiveness so much as on unique looks  but to me the industry should rly change and embrace a not so thin ideal because some of them  unless you re naturally skinny  don t look glowing or beautiful at all and it just looks sad ,1,288,50
jisoo s hair   that s the first time i m seeing it like this,1,60,11
it s [true]   ,1,14,2
not sure if it s because i m a blink  but she s way more attractive to me than the other models  just my opinion  haha,1,118,23
sis looks like a wife of a billionaire who is ready to divorce his stupidass  because she is a billionaire boss on her own,1,122,24
there surely will be more blackpink events happening there in the future  as it had before so you ll have more opportunities to witness their     performances  as with the language assist  many thanks  looking forward to it ,1,224,37
ur right  my friend who does not listen to blackpink  or kpop in general  follows jisoo s account because of dalgom  she is a sucker for fluffy white dogs   and often complains that she rarely sees dalgom ,1,205,36
i m a newb to kpop concerts but just wondering how we can find out if they are doing any appearances outside the concert  maybe at a shopping centre or something ,1,162,30
yeah i picked up a floor ticket for  160 on stubhub as i m not seeing floor ga that low on ticketmaster unfortunately ,1,118,22
there are front row level 1 side seats for like  325 for the la show  those would be really good seats i m not a fan of floor seats so i got side level 1 seats  looked up the view of the stage on a website and i m super happy with the view  it honestly hasn t hit me that i m going to see them live  ,1,300,64
its fantastic  i m not seeing a lot of resale for ga or the really close 1st levels though  so hopefully those are all taken by actual blinks  imo this is great  might actually be able to get seats at cost  ,1,207,40

you ve been blessed,1,19,3
why is this on my dashboard  im not subscribed,1,46,9
man i m really envious of her wardrobe hahaha,1,45,8

every sold out concert will also have a lot of resale tickets  also can confirm about resellers discounting  i have an extra vip ticket on stubhub for face value   fees  no one is buying and i m panicking lol,1,208,39
oh no i didn t attend the concert which apparently was      if you have any questions about the language in the future i might be able to help  cheers ,1,151,29
i m totally with you  i d love to see a black velvet collaboration would be awesome  it s one of my dreams along side a bigbang x blackpink album ,1,146,27
interesting remix  ,1,19,2
he s too cute not to get kisses  ,1,33,7
i love her outfit  she always looks pretty but i think outfits like this really bring out her beauty a lot  i think it s such a classy look  i hope she had fun  looks like a nice event  i saw another ig video of the place and it looks so pretty  ,1,246,51
i just ordered at hmv co jp   15  discount is awesome   i went with the special box version  the decision wasn t easy     hopefully everything will arrive well  ,1,161,29
ah i remember this  they couldn t win anymore because they already had won triple crown  so they went with a remix instead ,1,123,22
kiss  amp  make up ,1,19,4
hopefully something like that  i would prefer if they can promote the comeback in korea for at least 2 weeks before they start promoting it in america,1,150,27
not a big fan of this remix  but something different is always good,1,67,13

oh yes  yes  that s the blink tribute video i was talking about in my first comment  i m guessing we ll get to see the girls crying to the video in the actual concert dvd but set 1 probably will have the video itself separately on disc 2  aah  i m so excited for this ,1,268,52
not just the movie  they also made heart cutouts and stuck them to all chairs in the arena so when the video was playing we all held the hearts up and they were really surprised and cried lots  it was super cute   d,1,215,43

she is such an angel  also damn that turn  she just put every model on notice   y all out of jobs now ,1,102,21
petpinks stealing the spotlights from their mompinks  sometimes i let my mind think that probably around a million of her followers are because of her cats  maybe i m wrong  or maybe i m right ,1,193,33
yep  born and raised here   ,1,28,6
i love lisa  ,1,13,3
sometimes i forget that its lisa s account  and confuse it with a random cat account  and becomes even more confused on how i followed the account in the first place  so tries to unfollow it only to realize that its our limario whos bombing our feed with leo and luca,1,267,50
still look pretty much the same except she is hotter now ,1,57,11
you re asking at a bp subreddit so the answers are gonna be biased towards bp  and probably by extension yge   as seen with the majority upvoted comments here  nothing wrong with that but if you wanna view the  other side  of the spectrum  go to more less bp oriented threads forums  get both sides of the arguments and then form your opinion ,1,343,60
wow she looks absolutely stunning,1,33,5

hey guys  i draw and did some portraits of blackpink a little while ago and wanted to share them with some other fans  i m still learning how to use reddit so i hope i do this right  lisa jennie kim ros  jisoo  also i accidentaly posted this in last weeks discussion last night because i am that bad at using reddit ,1,316,61
thanks   but i was referring to the         which is apparently some bonus video which is only included in the first set  with the thermo bottle etc  ,1,150,28
how could be that guy behind didn t look at this cutie   ,1,57,12
just to add to this  the whole  jennie being lazy  thing started back in 2017 from a rehearsal  a rehearsal  not a performance ,1,127,23
love her outfit in this one,1,27,6
bp can appeal to wider age group and tastes since they have so many sides to them  they can be cute  amp  adorable  and then become fierce  amp  badass  then transform to runway models  amp  fashion icons  this makes them very easily marketable b c of that flexibility  you don t need to put them in a box ,1,306,56
the only connection is they have the same producer  well bp is prettier so that s no lie  they also have more colours to them and can do a variety of concepts  2ne1 very rarely ventured outside of the dark girl crush concept  that s no sleight against them since i love their music just pointing out the difference s  bp can appeal to all age groups since they have so many sides to them  they can be cute  amp  adorable  or become fierce and badass onstage  or transform to runway models next  they are very easily marketable b c of that flexibility  you don t need to put them in a box ,1,588,108
me in 2017  lisa is my favorite member of blackpink  me in 2019  lisa s cat is my favorite member of blackpink  ,1,112,21
best advice ,1,12,2
yes i also read that many us tickets are now discounting to like   47 for one seat   ,1,85,17
     is a name for a music platform  so when they said it s          means you can get all of the contents from dvd on to your phone using the platform  download the app  use the code they provided  and you can watch it on your phone too  instead of just watch it on dvd or blu ray\ ,1,283,57
thank you for your explanation      ,1,36,6
it was sold out officially  but since scalpers got a lot of the tickets they re being resold for under value on places like stubhub  i think a lot of people just aren t aware of that so that s why the resale tickets aren t selling either   also skepticism of buying resale tickets in general ,1,292,52
is black pink actually sold out their concert or not i ve seen on every platform  all kpop twitter oh  saying that it isn t sold out and ticketmaster and stubhub have a lot of seats left and even discounting tickets now  and over half the stadium is still open for sale   there are a lot of people saying it sold out and a lot saying it s not i want to argue with them but i don t know who s right or if i would be wrong to defend bp,1,433,86

she looks like a little child that was promised dessert  but had it taken away for misbehaving ,1,95,17
lol  no  i am just calling them that because their \ intent\  was to make a profit off of me at point of sale  or who knows  maybe these sellers are those  broke my leg and can t go anymore  better let someone else enjoy the concert   yeah right  types that stubhub would have us think that s what their site exists for  ,1,321,60
which solo  hello bitches or the other one   can t remember the name   if your talking about the other one  that solo was never really promoted and it was placed on 2ne1 final album  probably wouldn t have been as popular as solo  but it was drowned out by the group album  hello bitches  doesn t seem like a song like the korean public would like  whereas solo was liked more domestically  also seen as to try hard to international fans  plus bp have a bigger fandom and jennie is very popular  both of cls solo came at a bad time  cl was seen as the princess of the company  many blackjacks felt as though cls solo pursuits was placing group activities on the back burn  especially since she wanted to promote in the states which is a lot harder to do and takes a lot of time  same thing kinda happened when solo was first announced  but out of 2ne1 bom had the most successful solos  ,1,887,164

why was jennie s solo debut more successful than cl s,1,53,9
if you search kpop reddit there should be an article about it  but despite being from the same company and having similar music styles 2ne1 and blackpink  they have very little connection  they ve only really interacted with dara  i don t think the girls have ever mentioned them in an interview  although i m not 100  sure of that   also that they ve never covered a 2ne1 song  but that comment really shot the girls in the foot  it made the the general kpop already have a bias against the girls  made blackjacks even angrier as they felt that the girls have been replaced by prettier versions  especially when 2ne1 who only had one member that would be considered pretty in korea  built an image around not being conventionally beautiful  basically rejecting the male gaze  hence girl crush  which made blackjacks even less likely to support despite bp having similar music styles  ,1,885,149
yes  regular ga  ticketmaster reserves a small portion of tickets at inflated prices and list them as platinum with no extra benefits ,1,134,22
same   i m excited about the multi angle footage because during the concert the screens were only focusing on one member at a time  it will be super nice to check each member s expressions and all   d,1,200,36
thanks for the clarification  ,1,30,4
aiiyl was for originally for 2ne1  the songwriter made a post online how he was happy that the song was finally released  then people got mad at yg ,1,148,28
i m also torn between the 2 versions   i love photo books and nice packaging but on the other hand more video material is always awesome  ,1,138,27
thanks for the detailed explanation  ,1,37,6
there really is no connection other than being girlgroups for the same company,1,78,13
no  not really a fan of large groups  ,1,38,8
do you wish blackpink was still pink punk ,1,42,8
they were originally called pink punk  the other girls were miyeon  now with g idle   kim eunbi  euna kim  jang hanna  and jinny park  over the years  they either left  were let go  or were transferred to a different project group leaving only the 4 current members of blackpink ,1,279,48
what other girls were supposed to being blackpink  and wasn t this when they were originally called team a ,1,107,18
2ne1 members have stated in the past that yg would constantly tell them they re ugly to the point where they started to get low self esteem about it  which is why some people speculate why bom had plastic surgery done  yg also has a lengthy history of sabotaging his ggs  in the end thought bp was suppose to have more members  it s rumored that they were suppose to be his rendition of a  yg style snsd   but trainees were gradually let go left due to a number of reasons as well as both groups having similar vibes and producer so it might be a bit of a stretch to consider them 2ne1 s replacements  ,1,602,112
she is such a cutie  ,1,21,5
we don t know for sure  it s not so much they sound like leftovers but almost the same style as 2ne1   but that s because teddy produced all of them so it s no surprise they sound similar ,1,188,34
were they really left overs  randoms online mentioned that as if it s your last was a song from 2ne1 s summer comeback the year blackpink debuted,1,145,25
that s the connection really that s it  also some of their songs sound a lot like 2ne1 leftover songs  because teddy produced for both 2ne1 and blackpink  ,1,155,26
lisa is almost at 16m ig followers    ,1,38,8
why does she look so much like dasom here  what a beauty  ,1,58,12
thank you    i only got into k pop 2 months ago so some of these things are from my perspective too  ,1,101,21
i definitely agree with the timing and how each member shines as individuals yet they mesh so well  they came right when the public was starting to warm up to other concepts rather than the standard cutesy  yg definitely got lucky  ,1,232,41

my numbers are only looking at stubhub data  so when a seller no longer offers their tickets for sale  the number of available tickets goes down and their listing price is no longer in the  average ticket price   if they had listed them for a lot of money  the average price would go down too  i ll be traveling out of the country for 2 weeks starting next monday  so data collection might be missed a few days  i d appreciate help,1,431,80
 hi i m ros   and i m here to wreck you  ,1,41,9

now that the asia leg of the world tour is over i expect them to shoot the mv for the comeback rather soon  we should hear about that as always  after the black label release this week i also expect an actual comeback date for bp   starting with teasers  this sub will also hit 20k subsribers rather soon  i still remember the times when we are below 10k  d bp s youtube will hit 20m subscribers in the next 7 days as well  just like dddd 700m views  i think this will be a good week all things considered   ,1,508,100

sure  although i m not sure how much help i can be since you re doing a more thorough job  lmk if there are days you can t collect data  also what does it mean to delist tickets  as in the effect it has on the data  would that mean the number of available tickets go up on stubhub or down  ,1,290,58
they need more security  people are getting too close to them,1,61,11
the issue will have a variety of music topics including news about other artists  music reviews  billboard chart news  blackpink will be the featured article with more photos included  but that is typically 5 to 7ish pages ,1,223,37
oh wow  you re doing this too  i ve been collecting data since tickets went on sale in na  data i m getting  seats listed  average listing price  lowest ticket price  average price of sold tickets  i just added the data element  tickets sold yesterday  if you wanna help collect data  i ll share the sheet on google docs with you  pm me  \   one thing i noticed  lots of tickets have been de listed over the weekend    about 300 in la chicago  amp  newark  100 in atl and ftw  i think sellers are going to try to sell on other sites now ,1,537,99

it s because it s the current issue march 2019   current issues are  8 99  once the next issue  april 2019  comes out it ll be  16 99  unless it s sold out  most magazines do this with their old copies  ,1,203,34
i worry that yg has beef with sbs now though  which means they only have music core left as a stage ,1,100,21
we need black velvet pls,1,24,5
i am sorry if my questsion is unrelated to the topic  but what s inside the issue  i have never had billboard s issues so i am not sure  will there be exclusive blackpink interviews articles or something ,1,204,35
well in my country  malaysia  which have very strict gun laws  they did check bags  however i noticed security are less strict with smaller bags like maybe a lady s cross body purse    not sure if this is the correct term  no metal detectors scanners or pat downs  no water bottles  maybe able to sneak a tiny 250ml one  ,1,321,56
shes so perfect     ,1,20,4
yes  but only focusing on the regular cover  i am wondering why is it half off,1,78,16
well if i remember correctly there are two versions  one which is the version here and the other version is the limited box thingi where you get the magazine with the group cover and individual member covers ,1,208,37
my friends literally started liking kpop only after they discovered blackpink   i went from begging them to let me play some kpop in the car to jamming out together lol they indeed are the revolution,1,199,36
ugh too many  2ne1  iron maiden  big bang  linkin park      bts   metallica  to name a few,1,90,19
maybe they want to push the sales volume  get more people to know about blackpink ,1,82,15
couple nights ago i was playing apex legends  and after plenty of clutch good games   i decided to wrap it up with some kpop  i had a blast with 1 viewer and he wasn t even a kpop fan lol but i also had a random person come in to my channel and say  wtf is this shit  i realized that i would love to enjoy kpop and gaming when i go live  i am a caucasian male so i do not want to sound like a shamless plug  but its an audience that is already difficult to find in the real world   thought i could come here and find others with the same interest  if you have a different suggestion on how to accomplish this in the behemoth platform that is twitch   please let me know   ,1,672,134
very cool under the stage photo  love these behind the scenes photos,1,68,12
yes i meant in general  not necessarily fpr blackpink now  same was true for bb ofc  i think it has to feel very weird to play in front of a huge crowd knowing that noone really knows you in particular,1,201,40
damn i thought they fly in private jets hahaha,1,46,9
i think this is one of the easier song for the drummer  most of it is prerecorded samples  i mean you get to tour with blackpink    amazing  ,1,141,27

ticket prices will drop  scalpers lose money on every ticket that doesn t sell  they will drop prices as it gets closer to the event,1,132,24
because us blinks have to ball on a budget ,1,43,9
makes sense  blackpink is unpopular so they aren t selling well thus the price has decreased and those few who waste all their money on celebrities will splurge on the ridiculously expensive box set,1,198,33
there is already a [ 65 95 limited edition box set]   so i still wonder why is it so ,1,85,17
maybe it s because there are different variations and they want to sell as many as possible ,1,92,16
goddamn  i wish i had her kind of body  she s so hot  ,1,54,12

ooh i didn t realize set 1 doesn t come in the special box  thanks for taking the time to clear this up   d i m kinda torn on which to get    as for       i guess it will be a surprise  lol,1,189,40
what a goddess ,1,15,3
can you really call someone a scalper when they re listing tickets for below face value ,1,88,15
  caption      [  source  ]  ,1,29,3
yes  there bbs gd band  been with them since 2012  band six ,1,60,11
it looks like only set 2 comes in a special box  so i guess it s like this    set 1  2 dvds or blu ray     18 songs   tour picture   multiple angle stuff of 5 songs   surprise picture   thermo bottle   set 2  dvd   cd or blu ray   cd     18 songs   tour picture   cd  blackpink in your area   9 songs    luxury box   photo book  36p    set 3  dvd or blu ray     18 songs   tour picture  amp  x200b  i m also not sure about what      means  ,1,440,96
i think it s legit that they are taking at least business class seats on all of their flights ,1,94,18
i was so dumbfounded by her smile at the end that i forgot how much leg room she had on that seat ,1,98,22
jisoo has spoken so much chinese throughout the concert  which was a gift to all blinks ,1,88,16
dang  look at all of that leg room ,1,35,8
i m in p2 p3 mix and i really wanted the closer p2 but you basically have to take what you can get or risk not getting anything at all ,1,135,28
yeah  i m a bit mad right now because i couldn t get a good seat and ended up in p3 during the ga onsale  now there are tons of good seats started to drop prices on stubhub  ,1,174,36
it d be interesting to see how much the comeback  if it even happens in time  shifts price  supply  amp  demand  because all the hardcore fans will have already secured tickets  for the price to go up  bp would need to convince non fans or more casual   on the fence  fans to buy tickets  and i don t know the size of that population compared to those who already got tickets  if bp doesn t do anything to grab attention  i d predict the price to fall or stay the same ,1,469,86
the difference between the dvd sets  goodies aside  is basically set 1 includes some multi angle stuff and the blink tribute video  right  other than that it s just the bottle vs photo book cd  i m leaning towards set 1 because the bottle looks super cute  and the blackpink caf  one was sadly already sold out when i got there  i just want to make sure i m not missing out on anything else other than the cd and book if i pick that set  also  forgive my ignorance  but what is a       lol,1,489,92
i d love to try and get better seats than what i have  but i m worried i d spend the money and not be able to resell my old tickets  or that those tickets would go to a scalper and not an actual blink ,1,201,42
wow    amazed every single freakin time,1,39,5
when it comes to the korean perspective  red velvet can match up with bp very evenly  if not even surpass bp in some aspects of talent  in that regard  i would agree with you  rv can be the revolution as much as bp is  however  bp s secret weapon comes from their western appeal imo  besides bts  out of every single k group out there  bp has the best shot at wooing the west because of their sound as well as the individual member backgrounds  tbh i think bp has way more western appeal than even bts  i think bts got lucky in their western debut and is now snowballing into this unstoppable k pop force because they were the first to really break through but i digress   so i guess  it s just how you define being the revolution as  ,1,735,137
it really depends  if this comeback is huge i can see people buying tickets on stubhub and the prices rising  but i doubt they ll be ridiculous like double the price because of these second dates  ,1,197,35
i ll be going to melbourne alone  i have one friend who would love to go but their parents don t let them out of the house after dark ,1,134,27
between this one and the one she wore for her billboard shoot  im loving rosie in these hats lately   ,1,102,20
makes sense  btw i already have tickets but am trying to get more friends to go  below face value could convince them  last q  we re gonna hold out for now  considering we ve seen ga go from  250s to below  200 the last week  but is there a common point prices trend back up  too close to date  taking advantage of panicked buyers  ,1,332,62
if they predict prices will drop even further  then they would want to sell now since a small loss is still better than a bigger loss,1,133,26
second shows should definitely help make it more of a buyer s market  although i wondered about something  floor tickets for la has fallen below face value   198 50  on stubhub  although i realize the buyer will still be hit with like 33  fees  why is the scalper listing it for so low  if listed at  190  stubhub will take 10  so the scalper only stands to  make   171  meaning lose  27 50   does anyone know why they would do this ,1,433,78
it s always the music imo  just unique and teddy doesn t miss with his title tracks  i also think timing played a factor as well  there was a void when 2ne1 disbanded and many gg s didn t have the same concept as blackpink  don t get me wrong  the girls are very talented coming from yg  they came in with a fresh concept  it was definitely girl crush  but the personalities of the girls was unique to yg  fierce  yet innocent off stage not understanding how harsh the music industry outside of the music  the hate  the bureaucracy  pressure   i couldn t help but root for them because of it  musically  they re very unique individually  each member shines in their own way and their teamwork is imppecable  ,1,708,122
they ve changed perception of a lot of people who didn t like kpop  a know a lot of people that thought kpop was just  gay shit   showed them blackpink and they were like  hmmm   fast forward a week and i hear some of them humming the melody to as if it s your last or dddd  their music caters to a wide range  a bit like bts   it s not just 1 or 2 songs  it s all of their songs which cater to the west  it s probably why they ve already broken through the west after 2 years of debuting  bp aren t my favourite group  but they do live up to that title  yg freaking knew ,1,572,112
they look entirely healthy to me  they work out constantly  amp  probably eat more than the average chick does to compensate for that  got downvoted because they said  yikes  clearly implying a negative associated with their looks  not that complicated  you re allowed to have the opinion  we re allowed to think the opinion is trash ,1,334,54
isn t the live band also the guys that tour with big bang before ,1,65,13
you could say that  because they make music that can be played in the west because some of their music  like boombayah  amp  d4  are pretty westernized  they make music that caters to the west and music that is more for the local scene  whistle  forever young   best of both worlds ,1,282,51
i wouldn t really say they have west in them aside from wendy and if we re reaching  their bb era  ,1,99,19
considering red velvet have all of those qualities and not just 9 songs to their name  you could say the same thing about them ,1,127,24
exactly  i m glad i didn t buy tickets for newark when they initially sold out since stub hub prices are closer to face value now  i actually think they could go below face value because of these second dates  scalpers will not go after these new dates because the resale is terrible right now  ,1,295,53
on the bright side  fort worth and newark ticket prices for the first date will take a big hit  and while scalpers will still go for the day 2 tickets  as economics dictates  increasing the overall supply of tickets will drop prices for both dates  ,1,249,45
i recommend using seatgeek and signing up    you get  20 off your first purchase  its a reliable site  and the prices fluctuate a lot so you can get a good ticket for under or even the same amount as it was sold as  i got my ticket for la around a week after they were sold out for  302 for ga soundcheck and a couple days later it dropped to  236  ,1,349,71
not sure why you got downvoted  unless it was because people think you re body shaming  but you re right  filter angle or not  they re really skinny  looks unhealthy to me  ,1,173,27
i ve worn docs almost exclusively for 24 years  at this point my legs are so used to them that i think if i took them off i could dunk a b ball better than michael jordan  ,1,172,35
i m also looking into buying from stubhub since it s much cheaper  would love advice or other people s experience with it ,1,122,20
if they did have a say  cl wouldn t have had so much problems not releasing songs  i think ultimately the guy who calls the shots is yg ,1,136,27
thank you  no  this is my third day as a mod here on   ,1,55,14
definitely angle of camera and the stance they re all taking  having good proportions in rose and lisa s case helps too ,1,120,20
gratz on the mod status ,1,24,5
i really hope ticket prices drop and more people buy them  i don t want the venues to be empty just because of greedy scalpers  but i understand why people don t want to buy resale ,1,181,34
on the stubhub app   40k people still bought blackpink s tickets for na  it s just all of the tickets available are resale tickets due to scalpers  ,1,148,25
22k   how do you see that  thats about a third of the tickets   ,1,64,15
any bp contents is good content  ,1,33,6
wish there was a way to deal with scalpers and resellers  there s about 22k tickets available for sale on their current na tour  scalpers are a huge pain in the ass and i feel like a lot of people who were tryna get tickets on opening day don t even know that these tickets are still available  i hope yg umg interscope addresses this and lets people know that these tickets are still out there  ,1,396,72
my reaction to this news  in gunnery sargeant hartman s voice   holy jesus   this is my second chance to seeing bp ,1,115,20

before this opportunity passes  consider this    blackpink is now in the same category with these other artists featured on billboard collector issue covers  aretha franklin tom petty cher madonna david bowie beyonce  amp  jay z whitney houston michael jackson that s some pretty pretty good company ,1,300,45

it s really interesting seeing this  thanks for posting  most of the time he doesn t have a lot to do  but there are some spikes where he can show a little what s in him hehe  sometimes i wonder how the liveband feels  noone is really there for them but they still get to experience the crowd to some degree  has to be weird at first ,1,334,64

i laughed toooo much at your reply loool,1,40,8
you get use to them tbh  when i first got docs i was dragging my feet along because they were so heavy to my calves and legs at first but the more i wore them they became more manageable  ,1,188,39
do you guys think they use the tall feature on the snow app  or is it the low angle that makes their legs look ridiculously long ,1,129,26
how does rose wear those heavy ass docs all the time with her slender lil legs damn  i m am athletic dude and my knees still feel discomfort after only a day of lugging around timbs on my feet ,1,193,38

she s looking so good  i love that she gained a little weight  she carries it really well,1,89,17

this is art ,1,12,3
legs for dayyys  ,1,17,3
while i always try to play devils advocate with yg  this is something that concerns me especially with touring being so profitable  i still stand by the fact that i believe universal music and interscope have some sort of say  it was sort of alluded to in the billboard interview and they will defiantly push for more regular new music and promotion  hopefully ,1,361,63

oh yeah sales are always the best indicator  youtube was the only stats i could think of off the top of my head  i think he will put more focus on ikon regardless with them being is biggest boy group until bigbangs return  i would really love to know what the interscope deal actually is other than global distribution and marketing because i do believe that will heavily influence yg s decision making when it comes to blackpink  it s gonna be fun to see how it unfolds ,1,471,86

bigbang ot4 is highly unlikely as the members are against it  notably gd   more likely that they do solos ,1,106,19
i agree with what the op said  that blackpink is most likely to benefit not be affected at all  but youtube views aren ta good indicator for bigbang s popularity  i would say digitals are a better indicator   amp  x200b  but while bigbang did well in 2018 i think it s almost assured that their popularity is going to take a beating   amp  x200b  however  i forsee him concentrating on ikon if bigbang doesn t work out  looking at previous trends ,1,447,74
you don t need to copy any files  you just need to use some videoplayer to watch the dvd  standard players like windows media player or download  vlc media player   anything works really  ,1,188,32
right    you ve got a point,1,27,5
not updated   what is seungri s scandal  can someone update me ,1,63,11
you don t need to copy the file to your pc if you judi want to play the dvd  if you have vlc  just put the disc in  and then in vlc go file open disc  select dvd  select the disc  and hit play ,1,193,43
yeah i have the dvd drive on my pc too and i copied the file in welcoming collection dvd to my pc  now i can watch the dvd but how too add english subtitles to the dvd    ,1,171,37
well you should have a dvd drive on your pc  if you have none you cannot watch it  so i am not quite sure i understand the question  ,1,133,28
i don t think its a true representation of the feeling towards bp  at least i hope not  i think its an echo chamber situation  with ill informed people echoing their negative opinions off each other  i think it s important to take note of where these comments are coming from  it s why i only really interact with people on this subreddit when talking about bp  if i comment on youtube  instagram or  i go in ready for battle but i like it here its respectful and everyone i ve interacted is well informed which is real cool  even if we disagree it s always done with respect  so far anyway ,1,591,107
right  but that isn t a new thing either  d i wouldn t worry so much  as soon as the first teasers hit people will go crazy  in a positive way  for bp again hehe  i hope bp will use these 2 weeks to promote the comeback fully though  with fan signings  etc,1,256,51
she looks sooooooo good  goddess  ,1,34,5
who exactly are these  people  though  you re taking the comments of some die hard kpop fans who hate yg who want to shade their artists and applying it to the vast majority of people who don t even know who seungri is  korea doesn t revolve around kpop and the people shading other yg artist are a minority of the minority  in that the people commenting are already a minority and the people specifically commenting about other yg artists are an even further minority of kpop fans who hate yg and want to shade their artists for whatever reason ,1,546,97
  what makes me further annoyed is the reactions from various kpop fandoms  they are just so fking crazy and insane  in all sorts of manners ,1,141,26
as long as there is no real scandal with any of the bp members they will be totally fine  guilt by association won t attract more haters than usual  it s just the same people being negative who would be regardless  blackpink will release good music  they will set new records with it because they fanbase grew a shit ton and everything will be good   ,1,351,64
yes    but these comments pop up very frequently right now which makes me feel that they are somewhat representative of the people think,1,136,23
it s useless to worry about celebrities  they have already made more money than we will see in a lifetime  i suggest worrying more about yourself and the people who are actually around you ,1,189,33
yeah     is correct  ,1,21,4
anyone got a link for the sub s discord channel  ,1,49,9
i don t know how likely blackpink are to be the top earners at yg it was just something i wondered about  i agree bigbang has far more influence  they are for sure the kings of kpop but influence doesn t equal profit  popularity does and unfortunately people these days seem to have short memories  to a lot of people if your not present you don t exist  i m not trying to slight bb i love them  i really want them to return with a bang so i can get my wish of a bigbang x blackpink album  probably not going to happen   i just like to wonder about these things  its kinda fun to speculate ,1,590,113

you might be taking korean  netizens  too seriously  a vocal minority of online people  similar to a comments section on western news or social media ,1,150,25
how likely will bp become the so called  breadwinner    i believe bb still has a great influence,1,96,17
oh yeah totally gd s scandal was a no story  i do believe that nothing will come from the seungri investigation and i also believe bigbang will be back better than ever  i just really don t want yg solely relying on bb to keep his company going ,1,245,46
it s actually 5  group shot plus individual shots  and you get 5 poster size prints of the covers  they don t say what how large  poster size  is  ,1,147,27
we d have to wait and see the final verdict of seungri s investigation  i think they ve already mentioned that bigbang was going to comeback as 4 while seungri was serving in the army  gd s scandal won t do anything as this is his yearly  let s shit on gd  moment  it was an overblown scandal of misinformation and the military deemed him still fit to serve in the army and wasn t discharged  ,1,393,69
i hope your right  it would be interesting to see how this affects yg in the long run with bigbang contributing more than half of yg s profits  i wonder what the likelihood of blackpink moving it that position if their not already  bearing in mind that bb can t make music until they are all finished with military service  the members that finish can do solo work but if youtube views are to be a gauge their popularity has waned  bb can t come back until 2021 at the earliest  so it would be interesting to see bp move into bread winner position  i think we may already be seeing it with the world tour  the deal with interscope and the promise of 2 comebacks and all the solos this year  how true that is only time will tell   who knows  ,1,741,139
her hair here tho    ,1,21,5
jisoo s smile is so infectious  ,1,32,5
i m pretty sure blackpink will be fine  while seungri s scandal is a big issue in kr rn  a lot of antis are using this opportunity to slander anything yg  don t get me wrong  i m not taking the scandal lightly  a lot of people are potentially victims if this turns out to be true but it s really the vocal minority that is using this to slander yg s other artists  ,1,365,68
i wouldn t worry  the scandal is certainly a problem for yg but those fans taking aim at bp are more than like the same fans who are already attacking them for some other reason  this is just more ammo  bp are massive right now so unfortunately that means there are plenty of people out there who have a problem with that  ultimately though this won t effect bp in the long run because it has nothing to do with them ,1,417,79
where do they post this    amp  x200b ,1,38,6
are there any previous issues also come with different cover versions ,1,70,11
i don t see it greatly affecting bp at all  more than anything  i m hoping yg puts more efforts into bp and their comeback schedule s  in hopes of bringing more positivity to his company image  ,1,194,34
imo  any scandal done by an artist almost if not always  would affect any other groups or individuals related or is linked to the person  i guess what i m saying is that  it will affect bp but not to a point that it would affect their comeback  the reason for that is yg is taking action for the whole scandal thing  saving face i guess  my opinion  don t burn me please ,1,371,71
a lot of people saying that ros  should wear more high heels  i think she and lisa get flats most of the time so jennie and jisoo can catch up to them by wearing high heels  i m interested in how they are going to style ros  for her solo  and hopefully we get to see her wearing some of those heels instead of doc martens ,1,322,65
i don t think they hold the money but they get hit with the price of the ticket   40  penalty on their credit card if the tickets are invalid ,1,142,29
ahh  that s cool  ,1,18,3
soo    jisoo took that photo right ,1,35,6
it s actually cheaper to get the whole set instead of buying them individually b c you get 5 versions ,1,102,18
i was gonna say that s expensive as shit and it s number 1  then realised it s a box set with 4 issues  so basically the same price as the standalone issues  ,1,158,30
i love this  natural  makeup style on her  ,1,43,9
lol i know and the ep distribution thing  i am just assuring myself again that there s really a comeback haha,1,109,20

i was thinking the same thing about parking off site  and we re just coming from the st  louis area  which is about a 3 hour drive ,1,131,25
i m looking for 2 lower bowl tickets to the concert at the forum  those scalper prices are just ridiculous  anyone willing to sell them at face value let me know\ ,1,163,30
if you are willing to park off site there is many places you can find within walking distance  i prefer this method to avoid the traffic after shows and games as well  alternatively if you are traveling  taking an uber to and from is often cheaper and less hassle ,1,264,48
stubhub has a pretty good refund replacement policy so if anything happens to your ticket or if it ends up being fake nonexistent  they ll replace it or give you a full refund ,1,176,30

i ll die if i look at this pic for too long  how  can  she  be   this  stunning    ,1,83,18
oh yeah absolutely  but i think that official download redemption is a stronger claim to it actually having to come out till the na tour than yg telling us that the plans are to publsh it this month  but yeah i am convinced that by the end of this month there will be new bp music  just writing this made me happier now lol  d,1,326,65
yeah man i feel u  i work out and i ve lost weight in every part except thighs lmao it cheeses me  can t do anything about it tho but keep grinding  i m sure u look like a goddess   ,1,182,38
yg has also said they are targeting mid to late march for the comeback  and i know  it s yg  but the girls have also said they have been working hard on it in the studio  and with interscope involved now i definitely believe it,1,227,44
  here it says one gets the instructions on how to redeem it before the concert date  which suggest that the ep will be out before the na tour starts  it s not a 100  given  but yg himself said that they wanna release it in march as well  it just makes so much sense and i would assume we will hear about the specific date soon enough   ,1,337,67

could you redeem the ep with your ticket at a later date possibly  if the comeback is a bit later than your na concert date  or are these sort of things only available during certain times like during a comeback   i hope i m making sense ,1,238,45
blacks  is the superior ros ,1,28,5
yes it is ,1,10,3
i have the same issue  my legs are as thin as ros  s and like  yea it s difficult because you feel like you need to desperately gain weight or appear a bit fuller and thicker   like jennie s legs  but then you accept the fact that everyone s body weight distribution is different and you re okay just how you are ,1,313,58
red haired rosie was a look     ,1,32,5

everyone s hypothesizing her solo  but i think this has more to do with an actual heartbreak she went through  her birthday post for her eyes closed cover did mention she was in need of the healing the song provided her at the time of recording it  ,1,249,46
leg goddess  i read somewhere she was self conscious about them,1,63,11
that happened to me too   i also couldn t stop smiling lol,1,58,11
i used stub hub for kcon ny  on the day of the concert there was something wrong with my ticket and i lost it  they told me to call them to schedule a replacement  my original ticket was p3 and they got me a p1  didn t pay any difference so i got better seats for a cheaper price ,1,280,58
anyone have just clear video gif without name on top ,1,53,9
i hope she can still do the dance moves now that she is missing a hand  ,1,72,17
i don t quite understand this line of thinking tbh  can you elaborate  that there will be a comeback this month is basically confirmed with the us tickets allowing you to download the upcoming ep ,1,196,34
would be nice if she could rock her own hair color again  but honestly i think makes every color work rather well  might be the reason they decide that she changes color the most,1,178,34

i heard kmu at the gym lol,1,26,7
ros  kept posting old photos these days  i smell a comeback or something related to a comeback ,1,95,17
i definetly find her prettier with darker hair  instead of the blonde  wish they let her go back to dark brown   black like here     but they probably dont want 3 members having similair color ,1,193,36

honestly  you re probably going to have to take a loss  you probably won t get back what you paid for them  i have 2 tickets i need to unload as well  i ve been keeping an eye on the la tickets  and there s so many tickets available  the price just keeps dropping  if i didn t buy tickets on release day  lower bowl at a markup  i could have bought ga tickets on stubhub right now for under retail  i m just going to wait another week or so and put them up for sale and get back what i can get back  if you want as much as possible your only recourse would be to wait until the end of the month and put them up for sale  but even then that s a toss up  gl  ,1,657,133

idk if this is a tl dr but on the subreddit  apparently seungri had scandals of raping women while sleeping  or something like that  had parties with high profile guests and ended up being a mess  with him drawing the short straw  basically  they blamed him for everything  this is my summary  dont take it for source ,1,318,56
same i don t really follow kpop news anymore  i tried to look it up but i feel a bit confused,1,93,20
absolutely stunning ,1,20,2
i m thinking solo teaser   if it s a group teaser wouldn t all the girls post it on their instagrams rather than just ros   ,1,124,22
they ll announce it after the release of the rteexanda track drops  at the end of this coming week or the one after if i had to guess  i would have thought that was always the case but i think yg will happy to have so positive publicity for sure ,1,246,49
omggg solo comback teaser    gahhh im so hyped   ,1,49,8
interesting  certainly seems like its teaser  exciting,1,54,7

just wishful thinking but i m hoping that they ll give us a teaser during their taipei concert tomorrow ,1,104,17
i can maybe answer 2 questions that havent really been answered yet  how are they different from jpop idols  well  for one i find j pop doesnt really put a huge emphasis on vocals or choreography  rather they rely more on visuals and personality  in kpop though  it all matters  there s more of an emphasis on visuals too  but especially on dancing  the structure of groups also seems to be different  in k pop eveeybody has a specific role  there s always at least 2 members with strong vocals  and maybe 1 or 2 rappers in the group  at least 1 really good dancer  1 person whos variety  1person who is the beauty etc  k pop idols also have a no dating rule  but this becomes more lenient as they get older  k pop idols also train significantly longer  usually 4  years before they debut  and as a result i find the debut age is older vs j pop idols  so you ll also find less  school girl  cute in k pop  groups also change style way way more  they ll have ballads  or a cool  concept  one day  and then sexy the next  and maybe a cute concept after that  they ll have a dance edm  and then acoustic ballad the next  most groups have a stylistic sound  but the concepts ans song  vibes  pretty much constantly change  also  if you re looking for a similar artist to blackpink  i would recommend 2ne1  now disbanded rip   they re from the same label as bp  and are bp s predecessor  there are some bp songs that were originally 2ne1 songs  and the song structure is really similar ,1,1481,264
jisoo looking tired   still fucking goddess slaying everyone in the vicinity,1,76,12
when traveling  i ll pretty much try anything to take in a culture  as well as  all the touristy stuff  i definitely need to see some animals while there  the closer the better   i love taking city and scenic photos  so if there s a place to get a view of the skyline or anything else mildly interesting  my friend might join me and he really wants to see the outback  but not necessarily uluru  is there any landscape on the outskirts that imitate that kind of setting  and the biggest thing i need to know is the best food joints to try out ,1,543,102
she looks amaazinggggg,1,22,3

i think we all learned one or two more things from this  this was actually really informative and entertaining  ,1,112,19
ahh  ok  you meant more then questions than the answer  i took  they re more free in the west  to mean that they were free to answer similar questions less    politically  for lack of better term  than they would if they were in korea  not that they wouldn t haven even had the opportunity to answer due to the question never getting asked  my mistake  sorry ,1,359,64
i didn t say koreans cared or would cause a fuss if she said she cried  in fact they probably feel for her  it s more about that line of questioning doesn t get asked in interviews b c it s not appropriate in public  ,1,217,40
oooh that one is so cool  i will definitely show that to her  thanks   ,1,71,15
i mean  there s accepted the adopting of customs and then there s reaction to a statement  it just boggles my mind how someone can react  how dare she   or  oh that s so interesting  to the same answer to a question just based on the geographic location of the person who said it  hell if that s the case then just hold all your press conferences in international waters and avoid all repercussions lmao  ,1,405,71
b c the culture in the us is different so koreans expect that  it s respectful and appropriate to adopt another culture s customs when you visit their country  if you were a westerner you wouldn t act the same way visiting korea and vice versa  so koreans back at home criticizing bp who are in the us wouldn t have any grounds to do so ,1,337,61
hello everyone  i m selling two section 21 tickets row 6 and the price is cheaper than all those dumb resell prices    pm me if interested  i rly got to sell these cuz i cant go    ,1,181,37
i get that  i guess i m just asking why rosie feels its ok to say that she cried to billboard but not at an interview in korea  basically  it s  i can t answer x question with y answer in korea   i just don t see why they feel they can outside of korea  it s not like their answer doesn t make it back to korean audiences  ,1,323,63
wow jennie is gorgeous ,1,23,4
it s not about going out of your way to be rude or controversial  it s more about it being inappropriate in korea to complain or share your personal feelings in public  for instance rosie saying she cried during her trainee years and saying how tough it was on her  that s the first time we ve ever heard of it  in korea the company expects you to maintain an image and cause the least amount of controversy  so if you have personal problems you don t share it  idol interviews in korea feels very safe and generic where as in the west the girls can express how they really feel in certain situations and westerners tend to connect with that more b c it makes the artists feel human ,1,683,124
why does it matter where they are though  does the korean press media netizens give them a pass for saying doing things abroad that they would slam them for at home  ,1,166,28
she can pull off any color palette  ,1,36,7
jennie from aiiyl with the ice cream cone with the lips haha ,1,61,12
yeah b c the culture is differen t  it s more conservative in asia  they re more free over here and jennie said they want to show that side of themselves and be less afraid to make mistakes  it s one of the keys that will make them successful is be genuine and not be robotic ,1,276,51
i felt that this and the cover story have already provided more depth to the girls than their asian interviews combined  their north american interviews are so relaxed and laid back  a nice change of pace  ,1,206,36
wow  this was better than the cover story imo  ,1,47,9
  mood    sigh   i m pretty stressed at the moment  so can someone just listen to my story rant    here s the sitch   i m trying to sell blackpink 2019 world tour tickets but i m afraid no one will buy them in time  during the day time the tickets went out  i was busy so i had my sister try and get me and my roommate tickets  she was also getting tickets for herself and a friend  so it was no big deal  but my sister is too naive  we ended up getting 3 pairs of tickets  i didn t really want her to get expensive tickets  and would have rather not get any if they were to high  b c i m just a broke college student and she s just a broke high school student   but she went and did just that  didn t even bother consulting or texting me or updating me or anyone    more problems \[yay  \_ \]   i know what you re thinking   what s the problem  you got tickets   yeah well no the situation is a mess  the friend that was going to go to the concert with her backed out  her mom got mad at her because the tickets were a hefty price  side note  they got ga  so she s not able to go  first  i m kinda like   gurl   why you no consult with your mom before buying  she must have known the prices    gt \^ lt  and my dude  it s not even like she has to bare with the burden of the expenses b c she s not even going to pay us now  second  here comes a plot twist  the  friend  my sister was going with is one of my close friends  so basically she grown so should definitely know better and have better control of her expenses  and so my sister doesn t want to go because she lost her companion  anyway  the next problem was that me and my roommate don t want our tickets anymore  other details as to why omitted   but regardless of wether we all go or not  that still leaves one pair of tickets to resolve  remember i said we had 3 pairs    like i understand its stressful when your trying to buy tickets  i ve done it before too   but she did a couple other things that i m still upset about  omitting b c its too long to explain   oh and to boot she used my mom s card so now my mom has a giant rip in her wallet  which i m totally pissed about     conclusion   so basically  i m trying to get the money back  anyone interested  lol thank you for sitting through my horribly explained rant\ ,1,2287,429
dj snake also liked and commented on it or maybe the adidas picture  ,1,69,14
wasn t sure if this belonged in the megathread or if was okay to submit the link separately like this  sorry if not mods  but i m really surprised there s been no official announcement about this   ,1,198,34
this just proves blackpink really knows what y all say about them on social media lol ,1,86,15
the fan project has a twitter now   blackpinkatl  ,1,50,8
i know i m breaking the unspoken  don t comment after 24 hours  rule  but i think you and i are on the same page  i m also a metal fan who somehow fell in love with blackpink  and lisa   and that helped me uncover a lot of k pop i never knew existed  if you re looking for something with more of an alternative sound  i can help with that  first and foremost  [ crazy  by 4minute]   without this song  there might not be a blackpink  and  since you re already listening to  crazy   you might as well try  [ hate ]   \  a song so alternative  4minute actually had to apologize for it  it also became one of their biggest hits  in my opinion  it s the greatest k pop song of all time  next  try  [ holup   by bobby]   and you can t go wrong with [ hero  by monsta x]   or any monsta x song  really  they re great  of course  you ll need some [ roll deep  by hyuna]   and  lastly  give [ zero for conduct  by bastarz]   a whirl  i realize i ve bombarded you with a lot of music you never asked for  but  if you re hooked on blackpink  i have a feeling you ll appreciate a selection of songs with some bite to them ,1,1111,202
seungri has always equal to scandal and big bang always survives  i doubt there will be any decreases of vips  new fans maybe  ,1,127,23
 tyga started following lisa last week ,1,39,6
maybe its more of a security  like this place is offering parking that you for sure will get  where as the venue will be first come first serve  ,1,145,28
that s where i was getting confused too  it seems to be a place that is 15 minutes away by walking  so maybe it s legit  but idk,1,128,26
on the allstate arena website it says parking is available 15 25  cash only  i m not sure on the legitimacy of the stubhub ones  ,1,129,23
yes  it feels like you re finally getting into it and it s over ,1,64,12
i ve so been enjoying these diaries  i must say though i thought it was so cute with jisoo s bunny  when i was younger i went on more vacation trips with my parents and always had stuffed animals and yeah the hotel staff would always play around with it and making it look cute  i just loved her giggling over that and it brought back my own nice memories with it ,1,364,70
i can t choose either  jennie hooked me from the outside  then i decided to binge watch blackpink house thinking it might help me narrow it down   jisoo came at me out of no where  bias wrecker   she had never caught my attention before  with her quirky personality  ros  with her sweetness love of food   amp  lisa s silly energy   it s impossible lol,1,352,60
correct  the  in your area  one has ecery song including ones from square up  it has the words  in your area  all over it to differentiate it tho ,1,146,28
the eps albums are quite confusing   so if i m seeing this correctly there are the following eps albums  excluding square up      blackpink  ep  cd and cd   dvd  the latter is also available in a pink box     re blackpink  ep  cd and cd   dvd  the latter is also available in a black box     blackpink in your area  album  available in 12 versions and the box there is also pink ,1,379,71
that s exactly the reason i was talking about too  i actually want that as well  because i want every song in japanese and english  the actual album is called  blackpink in your area  on ebay  and make sure you re getting it in the box ,1,236,44
thanks for the reply  i m gonna check ebay offerings out  p s   this is the version i was talking about    it s the cd   dvd version in a pink box of the  blackpink  ep ,1,169,33
need help here  coming from winnipeg  canada  i would want to come to the concert that day however  my flight arrives there  at o hare airport  by 7 44pm  would you think i would make it by then  i don t know if i have to go through customs there that would stall me from being late         and also  it would be my first time arriving to the stadium  would they let me in even if i were late  help pls,1,402,80
sorry for the super long reply  hope i gave you enough info about it  the black box one is slightly cheaper  but both will run you between  40 to  80  and make sure you get them in the limited edition boxes  because just the cd of both only comes with the japanese songs ,1,271,53
ebay is probably the best place for that  the ep you are talking about is a japanese release  the one with only the cd only comes with the korean songs  if you get the version in the pink box called   blackpink in your area   it comes with two cds and dvd  the second cd has every song from all three blackpink albums in korean  and the dvd has all of the music videos in japanese i believe  there is another box that is black that is just called  blackpink   that i believe is similar  but only has songs from their first two albums  seeing as square up didn t come out yet ,1,575,112
yea sure  pm me i can start a group chat for the 3 of us  amp  x200b ,1,69,16

the other thing with gd is that he isn t at the same rank as the people he enlisted with  something to do with taking to many holiday days  the military have said that it has nothing to do with the amount of holiday and that he will be promoted soon  it s something like that anyway  i didn t look to heavily into it,1,316,62
man  rose speaking in english has such a different vibe than when she speaks korean  she s chic in english and shy in korean  lol ,1,130,24
i m getting tiffany vibes from her in that outfit and as the lead english speaker,1,81,15
member when rose s solo debut was soon   amp  x200b  pepperidge farms members,1,77,11
we re getting so much of lisa s english it s so fkn cool  ,1,58,11
oh wow i had no idea either  i like all sorts of music from country to metal and rock and pop but i just find it so interesting as well  i think it s great bp s fandom is so diverse in their musical taste s ,1,207,43
i see you already mentioned you re hooked  i recommend their reality show blackpink house if you haven t seen it yet  and they have a current series going on too with blackpink diaries  as far as j idols i don t know anything about them to compare them or not  and since you mentioned liking j rock i would recommend the kpop group dreamcatcher  they have a pop rockish type of sound  i think their sound is unique anyways  i know rose plays guitar and jennie in a diary mentioned she helped with writing  stay  but i don t know if it s been told what that exactly means  and yes i too am a fan of metal and rock music  especially 80 s rock  ,1,642,119
thank you for sharing this  i love interactions like this a bit more than your typical sit down interview  those are nice too but i feel like with these video s you re getting to see them a bit more with their personalities and i enjoy that a lot  ,1,248,47
i liked hitting them with your highlight haha  ,1,47,8
 i think the point of it is to be savage   lol,1,46,11
all i can say is   look into bts  ,1,34,7
these fits are mad cute,1,23,5
rosie in that outfit     i need more  ,1,38,7
my wife     ,1,12,3
ah  gotcha ,1,11,2
there isn t a lead singer  what i think they were asking is there one person that sings the most  gets more vocal time than the others  i personally don t think they have a lead  they have main vocalists but that s a different meaning than lead  just like bp doesn t have a leader  they don t have a lead singer  no kpop group really does  lead singers tend to literally be almost the only ones singing  also i wasn t counting jennie out  that s what i said  ,1,459,84
i m not quite sure what version you mean but check [these]   search results on ebay and see if any of them are the ones you want  i think overall you can find these limited versions but they re either pretty expensive or not  new  ,1,231,43
please be true  we need it,1,26,6
what do you mean  wouldn t ros  be the  lead singer  as she is the main vocalist  and jennie is a lead vocalist too along with jisoo  no need to count her out ,1,159,32
these are in the special edition solo photobook  ,1,49,8
when rose was singing in thai  lisa looked like she was about to cry  that was so moving  lt 3 i feel so proud of my girls  watching them grow since the debut and now they are giving interviews to billboard and doing a world tour and tour and debut in america  i m deeply moved by these series   ,1,296,58
don t worry  the march comeback is confirmed considering how they re giving out a download link for their upcoming ep for ppl that bought tickets for the concert  ,1,163,28
if yg don t give us bp s comeback  soon   he d better be in hiding cuz the blinks would go for his head  ,1,105,21
oh it s osu lazer  if you don t understand this joke  it s a new client for a rhythm game called  osu   and the only thing that the creator had said about the release date is that it s coming  soon  and he s been saying it for almost a year  ,1,242,46
what if soon is the name of their next ep comeback   amp  x200b  jk too delusional,1,82,15
omg that shipping to canada is  43 usd  regardless if you select the box set or the one magazine    i ve never purchased magazines before    do they sell these in store somewhere in toronto  chapters   ,1,202,35
hate is a strong word and most of the scandals you have stated have no credibility  if other blackpink members love her i see no reason to hate her  hating someone for petty stuffs and no concrete evidence is a disease  look at her positives not her faults ,1,257,48
i really hope it s true but i m still cautious because yg is releasing so many statements about how his other artists is finishing   finished with album preparations ,1,166,28
won t go so far as to hate her  but she is the least fav  hmm too much media play for her   ,1,92,21
any tl dr out there who cares to explain the scandal ,1,53,10
jennie was in a reality show called survival village  this is also worth a watch as she is so cute  [here is link to the series]  ,1,130,26
jisoo is getting better ,1,24,4
haha as i still don t quite know how to attach an imgur album here so i just directly made a photo collage lol,1,110,23
that was before they were signed to interscope and not a lot was happening on the us front  now the whole projectory has changed since they got signed  they re now being heavily pushed in the west with collabs and maybe english speaking music to come  this is not a half hearted effort  ,1,287,52
i knew exactly what this was going to be before clicking xd,1,59,12
wait till you get hit with that ddu du ddu du du  ,1,50,10
could also be   o son we will never come back ,1,46,10
please yg pleaseee ,1,19,3

oh gaben ,1,9,2
please don t play with my heart like that     ,1,46,9
the program is an app called intolive  you can see the app s name at the bottom of his video  i just made one for ros  and now i never want to unlock my phone ,1,159,34
comeback within the decade     yg please  ,1,42,8
valve time  cries in hl2 ep3 ,1,29,6
ikon  their concerts look so amazing  ,1,38,6
bp did an interview around the time 4d came out and jisoo said they had no intention of going west  but if it comes it comes  the west isn t their main priority it just so happens that they re in demand and here we are  ,1,220,44
very interesting subliminal message,1,35,4
i like it s a little of her being shy and her not wanting to exclude jisoo  lisa is considerate that way  ,1,106,22
 gt 95  of them are   kpop   bts fans just looking to hate it s pretty evident lately that army s feel threatened by blackpink s western debut challenging bts s reign so a lot of them are doing the most to put down bp  especially when it comes to gma since bts also performed on the show  ,1,289,52
 gt they ve stated multiple times that they re not made to breakout in the west have they stated that  i know red velvet recently openly stated that they have no intentions of debuting or doing anything more in the west other than playing shows for their western fans  but i always thought bp  or rather yg  lowkey had the motive to go big in the west  ,1,353,64
for what it s worth  i d just like to say i was super indifferent  bordering disdaining  towards kpop before giving blackpink a shot and now i m hooked on hard  ,1,161,28
ffs gaben,1,9,2
not sure if she speaks all the time  but it seems that she speaks english with her dad,1,86,18
i ve played valve games before  i know what  soon  can mean ,1,60,11
jennie seems so shy on these interviews  i hope she eases up a bit and talk a lot more like rosie ,1,98,21
rose is slowly but surely becoming my bias wrecker  ,1,52,9
 soon     ,1,10,2
the waiting game commences  hope you have fun too  i m sure it s going to be great  ,1,84,16
i love when rosie goes full chipmunk    they way she just kept saying  yummy   ugh  shes adorable ,1,98,18
congrats  now we play the waiting game haha  hope you have fun at the concert in advance ,1,89,17
most of your questions have already been answered by other people  so i m going to chime in and recommend dreamcatcher  they have a more rock like sound  ,1,154,27
agreed  felt like 2 minutes  ,1,29,5
thank you so much bro  i ve made live wallpapers before but honestly was just hoping to get his already compiled version of like 30 different clips spliced together without having to go through the work of downloading and editing it all over again  thank you for sharing yours ,1,277,48
yea shoutout red for fighting the fight  even if it may be futile on  he does bring up a lot of valid points  but the hivemind will react as the hivemind does unfortunately ,1,173,33
soompi award scoffs ,1,20,3
probably but blinks thought it was the butterfly theory for the comeback ,1,73,12
ohhh i see  i was thinking of a different tweet  oooh i don t remember seeing this one  interesting  this was probably about loona  then  right ,1,144,25
no  i didn t get vip tickets though  pm me ,1,43,9
sure  you got the vip too  ,1,27,6
just checking in  i got in queue for the tickets today at 2pm and they were selling more black vip tickets and i got one  sooo excited  ,1,136,27
let me see if i can find it  ,1,29,8
nice  i m going from toronto myself  i was looking at go bus   train to get to hamilton  if you want to tag along pm me ,1,120,26
korea and japan and asia will probably always be their main and profitable region and the region they ll pay most attention too  blackpink are still foreign artists and are still relatively  new   there s an estimated 60 million spanish speakers in the us and latin music and besides a few big names latin music and artists is still somewhat niche  despactio probably wouldn t have been as big of a hit without justin beieber on the track  unless they get a  1 hit or sell taylor swift levels on the next ep in the us  they ll probably balance between east and west   off topic  this probably why yg is keeping cl in the dungeon  she wants to promote solely in the us but he knows that they d make more profit with promotions in korea and japan sea  also with gd scandal he was only moved because his roommate was basically spying on him and sent it to his girlfriend  detailing his habits  injuries and even his medication  i think even relvead he was on anti depressants  unless something else happened with gd that i m unaware of  ,1,1034,183
oh i love this    how they re all combined together in one image   super cute ,1,78,14
what was that tweet about   twitter stans were freaking out in the replies  assuming it was bp and guessing what was wrong  but i never even figured out what he was referring to lol  people need to chill ,1,204,38
i m going from toronto to hamilton alone  if anyone is going solo too and wants a friend feel free to pm me   ,1,110,23
the only real complaint i have about these so far is that 10 minutes is just not enough haha  for real though  great content showcasing all kinds of aspects in them  be in rehearsal  backstage  getting makeup done  and also the things they do in their freetime  episode 3 cannot come fast enough,1,295,53
i noticed this as well  would be really weird to only drop 2 parts though  i d assume that we will get more for sure  cannot really explain why the ending would be like that though  d,1,183,36
 hi  i m jisoo    d,1,19,4
so lisa speaks english at home ,1,31,6
personally i think it s better if you listen to the music first and then do research on the group  otherwise you ll get yourself invested in a group genre that you may not personally like ,1,188,33
5 plates of food  that s my girl  ,1,34,7
holy jennie,1,11,2
can t go a variety episode without chipmunk chaeng eating  ,1,59,9
while seungri has given himself and yg a bad look due to association  i don t think this will affect blackpink  they ve stated multiple times that they re not made to breakout in the west  they re main focus is i  korea and if they so happen to get big in the west  then theyll let things happen as they come  the girls will be fine in korea  also this is off topic  but i really don t think bigbang is finished  if nothing comes of the investigation and seungri enlists scandal free until his release bigbang will be fine  gd s army thing turned out to be a joke of a scandal  this is his yearly  let s shit on gd  moment  nothing will change in regards to his popularity  ,1,674,124
ok thank you ,1,13,3
yes  i think the fact that they display genuine friendships is what makes it so easy to like them all  but my bias journey was  jennie    gt  lisa    gt  jisoo    gt  rose    gt  ok i just like everyone lol ,1,207,39
they are absolutely amazing and i would 100  recommend them but then again i m slightly biased  d,1,97,17
for real  just solidified my bias lmao ,1,39,7
ooh i remember seeing them on the fine brothers react channel a few years ago  seem like talented and humble ladies ,1,116,21
their main target market will always be korea  because of their heritage and fan demographics  their 2nd market will be japan  in terms of revenue probably 1st   if they go fully western  you would see 100  english songs  so little kids can understand them  they need to live in the usa to perfect the language for media  kpop is not just music though  compare it to all the latin musicians who try to break into the north american music scene  everyone starts singing english songs  living in the usa  etc ,1,507,90
thanks for responding  i really appreciate your description of the members  very helpful    i m a massive fan of babymetal  kawaii metal  jpop metal fusion  band  so i m quite used to young women with a large stage presence and choreography haha,1,245,40
hehe no problem  ,1,17,3
no problem ,1,11,2
hi  thank you for responding  this is super helpful and interesting  and i m gathering that yg is a talent scout agency mixed with brit school  also thanks for the links i will definitely check them out  ,1,204,35
hope this helps  didn t have time to proofread or anything  1  yep they are idols  i don t know much about jpop but basically they had to audition for their companies and then be trainees for 4 5 years before debuting as a group  2  formed though auditioning to yg entertainment and training for years  jisoo  oldest  24  pronounced gee soo   korean  lead vocal and visual  will explain what roles mean later on   known to be the crazy one with a 4 dimensional personality  fake maknae  maknae is the youngest of the group  this means she acts like a maknae sometimes   jennie  23  korean but studied in new zealand so is fluent in english  main rapper  vocal  fashionista  sponsored by chanel  fierce on stage but soft off stage  has a solo song that came out recently  ros   22   pronounced rose ay  nickname rosie   main vocal  lead dancer  australian  native english speaker   amazing voice and super soft  queen of capturing people with her elegance when speaking english  loves food  lisa  21  thai  main dancer  lead rapper  didn t know korean before becoming a trainee  fluent in english  maknae  cute goofball and amazing dancer  happy virus off stage hardcore on stage  3  blackpink is probably a good place to start for english speakers as they re almost all fluent  4  pop  edm  hip hop elements  basically combination of vocals  raps  and hard hitting choruses  performances are great  they have cool choreos and do different song and dance covers  really good stage presence for only 4 members  5  they mostly don t write produce songs  but they have a lot of say in the creative process  as they said in a recent billboard interview  i think they took part in composing the song stay and jennie in her solo song  ros  plays guitar and piano  lisa the ukulele  6  mini albums or eps  square one  square two  square up  all overall the same genre i described before  sq one  boombayah  club song   whistle  relaxed and cool   sq two  stay  ballad   playing with fire  long rap  mellow but cool chorus   sq up  ddu du ddu du  hard hitting chorus  rap break   forever young  more vocal focused and light   really  carribean vibes   see u later  break up song and the chorus goes hard  7  i think it being kpop in general is what sets it apart first and foremost  the quality of kpop is on a whole other level from western music  you have amazing music videos  high fashion  catchy choreo  songs you can vibe to  other than that  the girls all share a lot of instagram photos  pull of the girl crush vibe amazingly  are humble  and talented in rap  dance  and song  very charismatic too  8  they have more or less equal distribution  for the roles  main gt  lead  main typically has better range in that skill than lead  but both get time to shine  jennie and lisa are the only ones who rap and sing  jisoo and ros  solely sing  lisa is the best dancer  visual means they re the  face  of the group technically  all the girls can really sing and dance though ,1,2969,506
i think you re heavily underestimating bigbang and how big they really are  and at the same time overestimating the impact of these  scandals   first  bigbang aren t just another kpop group  they are by far the most successful kpop group in korea and no one is even close  individually and as a group  gd is arguably the most successful male soloist in korea in the past decade  a scandal to the least popular member like this isn t going to hurt as much as you think  much of this is just overblown stuff  many people are taking  knetz  way too seriously  they are a minority of online people that are usually heavily invested and are just like random people on social media such as twitter or reddit  yes  they will make noise  but they aren t representative of what the vast majority of people think because the vast majority of people literally don t care about stuff like this  if a popular singer in the us got into some scandal 95  of people living here wouldn t know  because the vast majority of people don t care what some random singer does  people in general want to see justice  but people aren t bothered to follow what every singer does or keep up with celebrity drama  seungri is the least popular member and much of this is overblown  the gd thing is a bigger issue but even then it s overblown and frankly most people don t care  even if a bunch of people online make some noise ,1,1397,249
thank you for taking the time to answer all my questions  i didn t intend for them to be so extensive but your responses are really helpful  also i m reality trash so i will absolutely binge their mini series  thanks ,1,217,39
maybe they ll do more as they tour in different locations  like a us diary europe australia  ,1,93,14
this was such a great episode  it really had everything  ros  being the cute baby chipmunk she is  always eating  mc chu earning her adidas money  jennie being jennie  cute and wonderful  also lisa s face when ros  was singing in thai  the sweetest  also thai blinks are awesome  they showed the girls so much love  i love seeing that  ,1,336,59
yeah same for me  i usually came from metal rock and then got more into progressive metal rock and in a way the way they changed things up in their songs made me fall in love with bp really fast  like yeah it is obviously not as musically sophisticated as other things i listened to before  but it still catched my interest especially compared to western pop  ,1,360,65
hello  hope it helps   who are the members  what are their personalities like and how did they form    the members are jisoo  jennie  ros  and lisa here is a video that can give you an idea of their personality  [  from [inside blackpink s u s  takeover]    gt the group s members came to seoul from all over the world starting in 2010 to take part in yg s rigorous recruitment and training process  the company and its competitors hold tryouts both within and far beyond korea  ros  traveled to sydney from her home in melbourne   seeking recruits who are typically preteens or teens  ethnically korean and fluent in the language  though these qualities are not mandatory  lisa  who auditioned in her native thailand in 2010  didn t speak any korean when she began training in seoul in 2011   gt   gt for all four women  joining yg meant enrolling in a kind of full time pop star academy that jennie calls  more strict than school  and that ros  likens to  the x factor  with dorm rooms  for 12 hours a day  seven days a week  the future members of blackpink    along with  by jennie s estimate  10 20 other aspiring singers who cycled through the project    studied singing  dancing and rapping  taking part in monthly tests designed to identify their strengths and weed out subpar trainees   somebody would come in with a piece of paper and stick it on a wall  and it would say who did best  who did worst  who s going home   recalls jennie  whom yg initially steered toward rapping because she spoke fluent english   you get a score    a  b  c   lisa explains   lisa would always get a s for everything   adds jennie with a laugh   amp  x200b  here are some videos you might want to check out whistle at university festival   [  solo   dddd   forever young   [  sure thing cover   [ ,1,1787,310
i ll try my best  1  yes they are considered idols  idk how they differ from japan  2  jisoo  24   part of the vocal line  known as the  visual  of the group  her personality is so unique and she s such a goof ball  jennie  23    rap and vocal line  definitely the more well known trainee before debuting  she s pretty quiet  seems like a bad ass but she s actually super sweet and has a soft personality  ros   22   part of the vocal line and main dance line  ros  loves food  she can play guitar and piano  she was born in nz but grew up in australia  so she has a cute accent  she s my bias  lisa  21   dance line and rap line  she s an amazing dancer  just look up her yg academy dance video  she s my bias wrecker for sure  3  i do think bp is a good place to start  there sound is definitely more westernized than other kpop girl groups  bp is where i started and now i love twice  rv  most soloists  weki meki  gidle  4  they are what you call a  girl crush  concept  more sexy  more hip hop pop influenced  complete opposite of twice s  cute  concept  5  this is kind of unknown if this have a say in lyrics instrumental  jennie once made a comment about their song stay that makes me think that they have a say in lyrics but this isn t confirmed  6  they do not have a full album yet  only square 1 and square 2  both with two songs each  and then square up which is their mini album with 4 songs  i would say sound wise it s pretty consistent  though square up has more of a beachy vibe to it  7  i find them unique in the kpop setting  and kpop is unique on its own  the collabed with dua lipa  that song is the only  westernized  song that they have in my opinion  8  no one is the lead singer  jisoo and ros  are knows as the  lead vocalists  but jennie has a pretty unique sounding voice so i don t like to count her out  i m sorry if i got some details wrong  and there soooo much more to say  but like others have mentioned  go watched some youtube videos  along with their little reality series blackpink house on youtube  ,1,2040,387
will there be an episode 3  they didn t do the  next  thing at the end of this one and they showed credits  maybe the credits were just for the thailand part of the diaries  in any case  i really loved this episode and i hope they keep making them ,1,248,49
21 seconds of rosie eating a cucumber is gold ,1,46,9
nah they signed with interscope a while ago when nothing of this was on the horizon  they planned this for a while and all of it is probably mostly due to market analysis  where the views are coming from on youtube and on other sites  i also don t think they wanna shift their main target market by any means  just expand in general seeing how much bp s brand power has grown since the last comeback,1,399,75
rose singing thai and the look on lisa s face      i got emotional  i m not thai but my husband is   hearing them speak it gives me such warm feelings  ,1,152,29
[remember to put \[eng sub raw\] in the title next time  ]  ,1,60,11
when they said  we have no money  in thai i lost it  that was such a funny moment in blackpink house ,1,101,21
my theory is how there are multiple genre changes in blackpink s songs  the first song i heard from them was whistle and i just    liked it within seconds  like  i remember thinking   this is really a good song   ,1,213,38
that s an interesting statistic actually  i would have thought a lot of the fans if not all would be from a pop background  i wonder what it is about this group genre that attracts alternative fans  ,1,199,35
no this is helpful thank you    ,1,32,7
honestly  i d say just jump in  go to youtube  type blackpink playlist and see how you feel  if you want to hear english rapping from them just add english rapping to your search  i grew up listening to a variety of music  classic rock  rnb  pop  oldies  tejano  but mainly rap and gangsta rap  and i  accidentally  found bp  i listened to no j pop or k pop at all  unless you count hearing anime op and endings  but a co worker listens to j pop and i was curious and found k pop blackpink instead  that s as in december and now i m going to my first ever concert and it s them  also  check out their youtube channel  watch blackpink house  jennie solo diaries and the latest series blackpink diaries and you will get to know their personalities  have fun  sorry for the long message ,1,784,139
yes  start with blackpink just realize they might ruin you for other kpop groups  you have been warned ,1,103,18
thank you so much for mentioning there was a box set  otherwise i would probably have never found it   just ordered one too ,1,124,23
you can google blackpink member profiles to find out abt the members generally,1,78,13
welcome  there s too many questions for me to answer all by myself  but it s interesting that you brought up that your a metal fan since a lot of fans of blackpink  or blinks  happen to be fans of metal or rock like myself  atleast on this subreddit  ,1,251,47
is this true  blackpink is doing a 2nd newark show  [ ,1,54,11
the sales page says the box set is exclusive to billboard  i think they will sell the magazine covers separately in stores and it probably won t include the posters  it may be cheaper to buy each magazine separately  shipping was about  15 for the boxset,1,254,45
can you buy the box set at the store ,1,37,9
i understand why people could have a bias for any of them or all of them  they each have their talents and personalities that are amazing  that said  i ll always be a jisoo bias because she is so beautiful  because she is so funny  because she is such a great leader unni for the girls  and because she is so adorable trying to speak english ,1,342,64
i didn t find the performance lacking  but i think those who criticized it should take into consideration that this might have been the first time the girls performed in that kind of environment  they re used to performing on a big stage where they have elevated above the audience  whereas with gma they were on a smaller stage and slightly below the audience  which was in closer proximity than what they re probably used to  people say  they re not rookies  they should be used to performing by now  but i can see how a different format would be a little disorienting for them  all that aside though  i just rewatched it on youtube and i don t get where they were lacking  they re all hitting the dance moves hard and making eye contact with the cameras like they were born in front of one  i might need someone to break down specifically  at what exact moment  they are performing poorly because i reaaally really don t see it with a single one of them  pretty sure this is just a  haters gonna hate  situation ,1,1015,180
i lice how the girls are so supportive of jisoo when she speaks english  i think they know she is not comfortable about it so when she puts herself out there they show her their appreciation  i think americans would be surprised to know that in korea she is the main talker on behalf of the group and super outgoing and fun  on a side note  kim jisoo forever    ,1,362,69
these photos are stunning  who else ordered the box set ,1,56,10
jisoo looks like she s wearing a filipiniana inspired dress ,1,60,9
i hope it does  their first interviews there made me worry  but i m so happy for them now  ,1,91,18
good read,1,9,2
just make a 5 second video in whatever video editing software you want and make sure the picture you want to have as your lock screen is the first frame  then move the video to your phone and use introlive to turn it into a live photo  you can make a 30 second video if you upgrade to pro  but i m too cheap for that lol  [this is what my lock screen looks like ]   also if you re too lazy to make a video  [here]   is the direct video for mine  just use introlive to convert it to a live photo and you re good to go ,1,517,105
that last question was so funny   well  the whole thing was  i m still curious why jisoo chose lisa as most likely to win an oscar lolol  ,1,138,25
jisoo looks so beautiful  o i am whipped ,1,41,8
i m the same way   i stan all of them equally as individuals  which i why i stan them so hard as a team  if there was no blackpink and they all were instead in four other separate kpop girl groups  each of them would be my favorite in all of those groups  ,1,256,53
1 52 and 2 05 that s all folks,1,30,6
even then i think her speaking is good enough to get the meaning across  at least when she s not saying something too complicated  she just has a fairly thick accent still  but no way to get rid of that without practicing ,1,222,41
yep  hopefully the trend continues with their tour to the us  europe and australia ,1,83,14
i can t pick a bias  they re all so beautiful and amazing   ,1,60,12
yeah exactly my point  would really leave a bad connotation to others  ,1,71,12
just checked it  well  should ve expected it lol  i ll wait what stan twt has to say ,1,85,16
new season looks good lol,1,25,5
i love this so much  so great to see all of them have their moments  and lisa being sassy in english was dope  should silence everyone questioning her fluency  she s just a shy person when she s put on the spot  ,1,212,40
whaat it s finished    ah damn need more  ,1,42,7
pure legend  thank you,1,22,4

i could listen to ros  talk 24 7,1,32,7
lisa s little dance move  too cute  ,1,36,6
can we please stop dwelling on the negativity  there are so many positive things for us to look forward to and so many reasons to be optimistic  let me tell you something  i watched the nhl all star game a few weeks ago  not sure if you re into hockey  but sidney crosby is regarded as one of the best players of all time  when sid went out on the ice  he was met with loud boos from the crowd  other players were cheered   know what he did  laughed it off  went out there and kicked ass  his team won  and he ended up winning the mvp award that night   which he accepted  to more boos  with a smile on his face  we can t control what other people think or say  we can only control our own reactions to them  continuing to get offended and take negative comments personally is not a productive use of time or energy  instead  focus that energy on being excited and supportive about all of the great things that are coming for bp  stop feeding into the negativity  ,1,964,181

legit  the  lack of stage presence  line has become a buzz phrase  all those people using it have no idea what stage presence actually means  they just throw it around thinking its clever  ,1,189,33
i looked through his history and saw that he s made a couple of different ones and never shared a source  i found out how easy it is to make one  so i just ended up making my own ,1,179,38
yes  this article made me very excited and optimistic for what s to come ,1,73,13
i love how lisa said she loves tyga  i ve always been so curious to know who her rap influences are bc imo  her rap style is one of the most western influenced in kpop  i d love to know what other american rappers she listens to  now  we just need a lisa dance video to  taste    dip   or  faded   ,1,298,59
this whole article is already pulling the negative nancy s in  not shocked ,1,75,12

that was probably u _theredviper_   our bp keyboard warrior  p s  i mean this is the most positive way  i promise  keyboard warrior has a negative meaning but i m changing this to be positive  i love reading the discussions red has because they are just bringing straight facts and most people don t know what to say other than just continuing to bash bp with evidence ,1,369,64
because one does not exclude the other  the fact that i like lisa most doesnt mean that i dont like the others  the contrary ,1,125,24
yea i hate that line  so assuming because   america is the center of the world and all that  ,1,93,20
any version with just the video ,1,32,6
they are all so cute  happy to see lisa  amp  jisoo getting comfortable speaking english  jisoo really does understand english pretty well  it s the speaking part that seems to be a barrier but even then she should be so proud of her progress  ,1,244,43
i couldn t stop smiling throughout this  they have such nice speaking voices and all look so radiant in their spring dresses  ,1,126,21
oh wow  i just checked the comments section in that video  it s clearly being brigaded  probably by twitter ,1,108,18
lisa kept shaking everyone s hand omfg she s so cute  ,1,54,10
i need ros  in that hat all the time please ,1,44,10
billboard s gonna make some     selling that cover set ,1,55,9
so i guess there s two  ep s  one next month  their solos  and then their debut album  and then possibly all english songs  that s a lot of material on the horizon my friends  ,1,176,31
i like how the members get to put in their own input to the song  and help with the song itself too  while k pop companies have a reputation for packaging groups assembly line style  blackpink s members insist they have plenty of creative input  despite having no official writing credits on their tracks  park plays them music he s working on and  really tries to put our thoughts into our songs   says jennie   he really gets his inspirations from us   ,1,455,77
they look so cute ,1,18,4
 and though occasional english lyrics already pepper their tracks  jennie notes that recording all english songs is something they  definitely want to do  in the future   they re focused on making their debut album first       ,1,227,34
anyone else notice that if you rearrange the highlighted letters in their names it spells out  soon   hmm,1,105,18
you gotta realize western acts don t do the whole dancing stuff much if at all  so any small amount of synchronous choreo is going to wow audiences  ,1,149,27
i have melted into a puddle on the floor help ,1,46,10
if yg don t produce more music with them and do more collabs etc they are wasting away huge potential  this group has the potential to become the biggest gg ever if yg really wanted  but people are already kinda getting bored by them nowadays because of lack of songs and the performing of same songs on live stages  and it looks like even the members are getting tired of doing the same songs live that s why their stage presence is underwhelming sometimes  as of now yg is sabotaging bp  but i hope they release fire ass songs for their supposed comeback on march and change all this  ,1,587,107
oh wow well spotted  you re probably right,1,42,7
might be just me but that reads as if everything they have done so far was practicing for america  ,1,99,19
yes   full of class  ,1,21,4
oh yeah the outfits are killer  so beautiful just like the ladies wearing them,1,78,14
oh   they deliberately highlighted the  s   o   o   n  in their names hinting that they are coming back soon    is that right  lol ,1,131,23
could be  but it s nice to see her confidemce grow anyway  ,1,59,11
all of them are like sisters supporting each others  it s cute and adorable  they deserve comebacks and more success   lisa s english is so cute  ,1,146,24
 intense choreography  oh boy   ,1,32,4
i think jisoo is confident here as they were doing this interview in a studio where the gma one was a direct live  and in a freezing morning  ,1,142,28
anyone agrees that their outfits here are gorgeous ,1,51,8
lisa is slowly but surely getting more comfortable with showing her english  ,1,77,12
lisa   i can speak a little bit english also lisa  speaks with her dad in fluent english and even has an aussie accent  amp  x200b  so glad she and jisoo got more confident in speaking english in front of the cameras ,1,217,41
it s a straw man argument trick   i m a fan but this is bad  style comment to try to trick people into thinking fans are turning against someone  this is done by  dirty tricksters  all the time during elections  the whole  jenny is lazy  thing was started by a non blackpink fan but they pretended to be one by claiming  i want my jennie  back and continued the pretense by adding  this is not intended to spread hate  to the comments of the video  it s very obvious when they post no videos until that specific one and they won t even use their real voice in the video  now  if that account had been posting videos and reactions with their own face and voice for months or years in support of blackpink and then posted the  lazy  video  then you could say a fan turned sour  this was clearly a hit job by haters and trolls  same as the comments in the highly publicized us appearance vids ,1,890,164
we are getting well fed  ,1,25,5
fantastic article and fantastic photos  as a blink i couldn t be happier  ,1,74,12
wow ros  hit me with that  it s super cute   ,1,45,9
its funny how she also got that aussie accent  her pronunciation is so good ,1,76,14
lisa and jisoo have become more confident speaking in english  i love it      ,1,78,14
jisoo s  its meeeeee  radiated cute and fluff ,1,46,7
i just love videos like this  they really just like each other a lot and it shows   ,1,84,18
lisa s english has gotten so good  respect ,1,43,7
yt comments are cancer  it s not like they are actually relevant opinions especially when coming from kpop fans posting these comments  ,1,136,21
did hear the part where interscope ceo said some of his artists wanted to work with bp  incoming collab  so excited ,1,116,20
they deleted again and again lol [youtube]   here ,1,50,8
they fixed the typo  ,1,21,4
wow  2 full sentences in english from lisa  again with that hint of an aussie accent  she should be so much more confident than she is  her english isn t just great  it s very pleasing to the ears as well ,1,205,39
shippers smh,1,12,2
cause this is the dedicated article thread i am just gonna copy and paste my comment from the other thread  just read the article  pretty good one tbh  what made me most excited was the suggestion that a lot of artists  want to work with the girls  tbh  that is exactly what they need to really make an impact  a collab here and there  happy and excited to see what comes next  pls yg give is some teasers for the comeback soon  d ,1,431,83

it s 6am over here lol,1,22,5
yea it was something i m not quite used to  i would watch all kinds of performances on youtube and only see positive praising comments  but in this case  it was unusual where almost every single comment was negative and critical even from blinks themselves  i guess i m unaware asf lmao  ,1,288,50
i just love them all because they re what make blackpink  blackpink ,1,68,11
wow  i suppose you are living in the us   so that means you didn t sleep the whole night just to update us for this cover   ,1,124,26
jisoo is my bias but all 4 of the girls are equally amazing ,1,60,13
i m going to bed maybe you can take over lol ,1,45,10
the ntsu arena is in fact a large gymnasium with a swimming pool in the middle of the whole venue  that is supposed to be the  rock area  where vip stands i think   watch [this bts taipei concert video]   for the view ,1,218,43
lol jeff benjamin said he missed a word there,1,45,9
yeah this is no big deal at all  technically no concert is ever sold out completely  people need to chill a bit  bp does very well with this world tour  in fact so well that they will be the girgroup with the most concert attendees  or super close to it  in the third gen and that probably means being in the top 3 ever  ,1,321,64
i have 1 extra ticket for hamilton that i m selling  it s on section 229  message me if you re interested   sorry for posting here as i don t know where else to go ,1,164,31
are you reading comments online and expecting people to be kind and rational  lol these are all from people jealous of bp success at pushing into the us market  it has gotten so rote they keep recycling the same hate over and over   jisoo can t dance    rose is damaging her voice    jennie is lazy   racist comments against lisa i won t quote   9 songs    fill out concerts with covers   it s kinda sad they are so unoriginal in their trolling  have a look at any blackpink thread in  and you will see any of the above mentioned hate trolling except the racism since that will at least get your comments deleted if not a ban  just ignore it and enjoy their performances ,1,671,119
yes ticket giveaways are normal for concerts but i don t know how k pop concert systems works lol haha,1,102,18
hey guy does anyone know where most people get their albums for group orders  i want to host one for my european blinks  because we barely have any  but i don t want anyone to pay ridiculous shipping fees  anyone with any group order experiences ,1,246,44
actually what has happened is that   the bts performance of idol was removed from the gma channel   and there were rumours spreading in the comments that yg paid them to remove the video   so in a sort of a knee jerk reaction   the furious bts fans came to the blackpink performance videos and bombarded it with negative comments   it s a really sad and immature move from their side  ,1,385,73
call the venue and speak to someone  they usually know all booked dates before the internet does  it s happened to me several times  i ve been able to snag tickets right away to unannounced shows  ,1,197,34
i thought it was pink package because of the price but it turns out they weren t  they were  357 dollar tickets and it s really close to the stage  but not in the standing area  ,1,178,34
maybe she got you guys c reserve tickets  ,1,42,8
 gt capacity 15k but yg are selling 22k tickets  i have no idea how probably tries to fit as many people as possible  not really the smartest or safest thing tbh but this wouldn t really be the first time either  yg did something similar when bigbang had a concert in gocheok sky dome  it has a capacity for  25k but yg managed to fit 35k 10k extra  people inside ,1,364,67
oh  i see where you re going with this  i thought ticket giveaways are normal for every concert  bp haters just like to use this as ammunition to further invalidate the girls  success  ,1,185,32
appreciate the link x2 ,1,23,4
appreciate the link  so the front seat tickets are the ones still available i finally understand why these videos are released lmao ,1,132,22
i m not sure  my friend was in charge of tickets  i know she s getting them sent to mobile and she probably would have gotten them insured  was it because it was presale ,1,170,32
 gt  it says extra seats  restricted view  were opened due to high demands i believe this is only marketing lol  amp  x200b  the reason why i say that taipei sales are particularly bad is because there are particularly more free ticket campaigns held in taiwan  as shown from facebook and other major websites in taiwan  in fact  even in hong kong  singapore  the philippines  and indonesia  free tickets had been offered by various local brands  to face the issue  this is also one of the major attacking points from bp haters,1,527,90
yeah most likely they didn t sell out but i don t think it did that terribly  they re just releasing 5 clips of 15 seconds of the girls inviting people to their concert  it s not like a huge desperation move either  [  this is the link to see how much seats are left  there are around 200 seats left for a 20k concert venue  capacity 15k but yg are selling 22k tickets  i have no idea how   honestly it s no big deal  that s why yg pr team decided to release those videos  maybe some rich kids will buy the remaining front seats haha  ,1,535,101
looked it up  and it says the ntsu arena has a seating capacity of 15 000 so yeah it is pretty big  however  i checked the bp page on live nation taiwan and it says extra seats  restricted view  were opened due to high demands  so i m guessing we re just a little paranoid  hopefully lol ,1,288,54
oh wow billboard cover    this release feels like it s taking forever    blinks are getting impatient from the lack of pieces with their faces lol  ,1,148,26
he followed lisa again and even commented on some of her posts  i think he is just a fan of lisa and that there was no plan for a blackpink collab like everyone was expecting   maybe he is trying to get lisa to collab with him  lol idk  ,1,237,48
the ntsc arena in taipei is actually quite big  k pop groups like bb  bts  ikon  winner performed there before  i am pretty sure it is even  bad  in ticket sales      amp  x200b  and for discussion wise  according to my observations  bp attracts many haters in the mainland china and taiwan  the discussions in weibo and ptt  something like reddit in mainland china and taiwan respectively  are always very mad  with tons of negative and hateful comments  maybe this is one of the reasons    ,1,492,82
agreed  i think the taipei concert is the only tour that was not sold out    it s actually confusing for me since blinks from around the world go to different countries to see them perform but the taiwan concert still didn t sell as much  i don t think the fan sites are also going  considering fan sites such as forever young  ros  s  went to almost all places  ,1,363,66
to be honest  it is quite sad and worrying to see that they have to make these videos before the taipei concert  whereas they didn t have to do so for concerts in other places  it apparently shows that the ticket sales in taipei is very disappointing  i sincerely hope that yg won t give up the taiwan market because of this ,1,325,60
what sort of stuff are you into ,1,32,7
sorry for the low quality but the [original video]   moonshot posted is low quality too lol,1,91,16
bandwagon hatetrain,1,19,2
she so exotically beautiful that she looks like anime ,1,54,9
same shit happened with jennie s solo  probably tired or something  don t give too much into it  like others said it s probably other fans being insecure of their popularity ,1,174,28
jennie is my bias then lisa  rose  jisso,1,40,8
lisa caught my attention first but jisoo ultimately became my bias  even so  i love jennie and rose  every other time i see them on videos each of them surfaces a variety of personality facets  endlessly charming  they are all gorgeous and adorable  i love their camaraderie as bandmates sisters housemates foodies bffs etc  ,1,325,49
 hi human   it s your   2nd cakeday   shichijou sama  ^ hug ,1,60,8

bby looks a bit tired      hope u r eating well,1,47,11
i m a bit hesitant to take this criticism at face value because i noticed that all of their american videos  even the interviews and random segments  have been downvoted by a small  but still sizable  portion of the viewers  like before some fans like me even found out about those videos people were already concern trolling in the comments  not sure what is going on there but it didn t seem like your usual response to those videos  now with that said  people have been criticizing bp for their presumed lack of energy ever since they started promoting dddd  i just think it s not a choreo that translate well to a small studio  but really shines in live concert with the band  so i m not surprised that 9 months later people still find it underwhelming  as someone who ve been following all their performance though  i thought their colbert and gma ones were among the better ones  especially because the audio playback was way lower than usual and you could hear them fine  just a bummer that the studio was so small  especially on colbert ,1,1045,183
so cute  her caption s the one she was singing in bp house when they were playing with helium  ,1,95,18
absolutely stunning  ,1,21,3
same for me  except mine is jisoo ,1,34,7
they will perform the comeback songs on the tour right ,1,55,10
hey i just saw your message  were you looking for bp tickets ,1,61,12
lmao k  ,1,8,2
it s not that she loves the look it s the look that loves here wtf am i saying      ,1,84,20
there were even blinks criticising them tho saying stuff like   it s sad to see blinks say it was a good performance when it really wasnt   it s unfortunate that they even failed to consider the circumstances  ,1,210,35
looks like a joke award but i ll still be happy if they win something ,1,70,14
i was actually curious so i looked back on their insta the other day  dddd and square up digital dropped on june 15th and the first teaser was posted like may 29th     it was just the name of the mini album but still a teaser nonetheless  fingers crossed we see something by the end of next week   ,1,298,57
go on ticketek now  ga tickets are available again ,1,51,9
even though ros  is my forever bias  if i had to rank them  i honestly couldnt  because there is no  worst  of the group  theyre all amazing in different ways  both vocally and personality wise  theyre all bias wreckers in my opinion    ,1,237,43
jennie got me into blackpink but i then grew to love all of them equally so i feel the same way  especially since when you meet other fans they immediately ask you who your bias is and i always just say ot4 ,1,207,42
do you disagree that jennie is hot   ,1,37,8
so do we   ,1,11,4
jennie is my permanent bias but my love for blackpink is far superior  this is difficult  lately  ros  s bias wrecking me hard  her confused and lost expression  the way she doesn t give a fock to what s happening around her gives me extra vitamin  everytime lisa is on stage i fall for her charisma  swag and the way she owns the stage  i m quite impressed with this lady  jisoo s personality and her work behind the scene makes me love her each day  she is the unsung hero in bp  i wish to have a friend like her ,1,515,96
so in a week or 2  nice ,1,24,7
in my best matthew mcconaughey impression  alright alright alright ,1,67,9

oh i thought it would ve fallen under the wallpaper post category which seems to be okay on the sub  though i m disappointed they never got back to all of us asking for the source  ,1,181,34
some successful marketing and promotion strategies by billboard,1,63,8
like the person who pointed out at the comeback discussion  i hope the m v features clips with members interacting just like whistle since most of their m vs only have them solo for their parts ,1,194,34

95  of them are kpop fans just looking to hate  dancing in heels in that studio place isn t easy  it s mostly just other fandoms hating so i wouldn t worry  their late show perfoqnce and is full of positive comments and it has more views ,1,238,44

well  i paid  170  after fees  for a front row seat in the upper section  lol had some  2 25 credits from that settlement  and got to use two of them  along with a  50 gift card i ve had for literally ten years  i m seeing two other concerts within a month and paying less than  20 for each of those tickets  so we ll call it a wash ,1,333,65
i don t know if [these]   apply but they re all i have in my phone  if you go check on twitter there are  a whole lot   jennie s really clingy  especially to jisoo  ,1,165,31
reddit mods are nazi and only want instagram updates posted on this sub reddit ,1,79,14

nominations  artist of the year album of the year song of the year best female group best female solo  jennie  best collaboration latin america popularity award best choreography  solo  music video of the year,1,209,34
i watched blackpink house thinking it would help me choose one but instead it just made me love all four of them equally ,1,121,23
i mean  did you see jisoo and jennie dancing in those heels on a waxed floor  let me see bts trying to dance on a floor like that doing their choreo and then those commenters can come back and speak,1,198,40
for me  in theory  rose is my fave  but i think all 4 are awesome  i ll see lisa dancing and think to myself  wow  she s so far and away the coolest of the lot  then i ll see see a pic of jisoo  and be reminded that she is just so classically beautiful my eyes might break at any moment  and jennie is so stylish and pretty it almost seems unfair  i can change my mind about my favorite 6 times before breakfast without breaking a sweat ,1,437,86
grr  twitter banned me for being underage and i m starting to get pretty unhappy at all the things i m missing out on,1,117,22
could i get a link to this gif you made  i would really love to use this as well  i have the app for it but i sadly am not good at creating gifs or editing a bunch of them together  ,1,182,41
i don t think they allow fan stuff or self promotion ,1,53,10
for other groups  there are some i like more than others  considering   but for blackpink  i like all of them just about equally  if you were to asked me who i liked more in a given situation  my answer would be very circumstantial  but even then i wouldn t be  stan  did i use this right lol   for that member  so no  no bp bias for me  i bias bp tho     ,1,356,71
this needs to be an ig post   ,1,30,8
legendary  spectacular  breathtaking  never done before  original ,1,66,7
they were a bit tired and nervous which are reasonable but despite that they pushed through  were full of energy and charisma  and gave a great performance and interview  my only minor critique is that i feel they need to practice their angles when doing certain moves  that ll definitely help make their choreo look more in sync and crisp  ,1,341,59
here s the [schedule]  ,1,23,3
can you please share it to your fellow blinks  we need it too lol ,1,66,14
that s unexpected    usually you have to have crazy breakthrough chart achievements to land one  ,1,97,14
people love to over exaggerate when it comes to blackpink hate  i personally thought it was a good performance but even is someone didn t think the same i find it ridiculous for them to comment over and over about their supposed  lack of stage presence     like seriously it s getting annoying,1,293,51
it s just bandwagon hate  it s going to increase as their us popularity increases  people will probably criticize the coachella performance too ,1,144,21
did you tick the box to get your ticket insured  those are like  69  getting it sent to your mobile email is  5 90 and having it mailed to you is  7 ,1,149,30
is it  i dont know  the link is still there tho ,1,48,11
why was it deleted ,1,19,4
comment here too ,1,17,3
shared it to a friend via link ,1,31,7

not gonna lie she sold the whole red vibe campaign really well ,1,63,12
are they both in the same section ,1,34,7
kinda wished they have another show in australia considering they had 3 shows in bangkok just 1 city  ,1,102,18
woooo a billboard cover   did we know this was happening   that s so exciting   i can t wait to read the story  i always enjoy billboard s cover stories  they usually do great  creative photoshoots  too   one of my favorites featured camila cabello when she went solo  and they shot her underwater  super cool shoot  ,1,317,52
i just want a song with their live band actually playing in it  ,1,64,13
billboard magazine ,1,19,2
not sure what s going on but  nice ,1,35,7
next piece [unlocked]  ,1,23,3
it was b c ppl thought it was a dj snake x bp collab so they wanted him to follow the other members too if that was the case  ,1,126,28
i m not sure but the usual policy is no dedicated cameras allowed  phone camera is fine ,1,88,16
dj   was back to follow lisa and bp though  he also commented on her post recently  and yes  stupid fake ot4 was back to telling kehlani to follow all members already ,1,167,32
i m not really sure  i just know irene will be there for miu miu and jennie for chanel  i think you ll be able to know the details on their website  if they have any   ,1,168,34

that  hairstyle   looks   amazing   on   her   just   like   everything   does ,1,79,18
no  don t be a saseng,1,21,5
lmao and why are you lurking on their reddit if they are so bad  the obsession man with these haters man      ,1,110,21
this is a very long shot question here     but might there be a chance the show will be livestreamed and if so  how close to the show does this usually get announced  i can t go because of work  but am dying to see the show  so i was hoping if by chance it was livestreamed  i could get together with some like minded blinks in the sf bay area and watch it with them ,1,367,73
no one noticed how much weight she lost   ,1,42,9
can someone who purchased tickets for either the atlanta or fort worth shows through axs explain what the magic sauce is to get that website to accept a credit card  i tried buying a set of axs premium tickets this afternoon only to have multiple credit cards error out  this same behavior happened when they first went on sale  i tried calling axs  but was told that axs premium tickets cannot be sold over the phone ,1,418,76
i don t like them because they re bad at singing ,1,49,9
does anyone know where this show is happening  i happen to be in paris on that day and i d love to see them in person ,1,118,25
oh     wow,1,10,2
damn man that s ridiculous behaviour  embarrassing tbh that they might have ruined her chance of a collab with him  he can follow whoever the hell he wants  thanks for telling me  ,1,180,31
managed to get pink package tickets  but did anyone else get hit with a really expensive booking fee  i my friends and i got 4 tickets and had to pay  114 each  ,1,161,32
fans got pissed dj snake only followed lisa on instagram and berated him telling him to follow all of the members  he eventually got annoyed by blinks flooding all of his instagram posts and yelling at him so he unfollowed lisa ,1,228,41
fair enough  i don t think i would ve characterized the performance that way  but to each their own i guess  i thought her rendition was pure art  but everyone has their preferences    like you  i m always on the look out for great bp covers  hope they keep em coming  ,1,269,49
tickets were still available at 11pm last night  ,1,49,8
what happened  ,1,15,2
will do ,1,8,2
fair enough  to each their own i guess  i thought her rendition was pure art  but we all have our preferences   ,1,112,22
dj   thing was pure stupid but i think it was certainly because of the fake collab news  from my perspective  i think blink see it this way   he is going to have a collab with blackpink and why follow only lisa when he s collaborating with the team   it was proper delusional  overthinking and immature though  i don t think people will attack kehlani  i hope  because i don t see them attacking halsey when she followed ros  ,1,426,76
i d like to see ponytail ros  again  it looks way too good ,1,59,12
i didn t want to name names but yes  that is one of the ones i ve heard  90  of that song is just monotone with an occasional emphasis on every 20th or 30th word like  fire   yes  the last 10  sounds nice but   the beginning and middle are not good  she did what she had to  give them a memorable ending  and she won  repeatedly  i m just not a fan of her singing style  sorry  i like dynamics from start to finish like solji did her second time around on koms ,1,461,89
lisa out here playing god with music artists  with a few taps of her finger  she has endowed someone with a million new fans and record breaking streams  ,1,154,28
i think you know deep down that this is the right thing to do,1,61,14
but when does she not ,1,22,5
inb4 blinks start harassing her and ruin everything,1,51,8
i really need this,1,18,4
they have some on hot topic,1,27,6
i hope people learned their lessons the first time around  ,1,59,10
lisa just updated her ig stories with two of her songs  so i don t think this is just random  i hope blinks don t attack her though ,1,132,26
apparently she is now following our lisa on ig  ,1,48,9
and forgot to mention that she worked her magic on the rest of us as well ,1,74,16
this was legit her move during the ayiil promotions ,1,52,9
that s what i m saying  please share the goods with your fellow blinks op  or share with us how you made this ,1,110,21
never  have you heard sunwoo junga s whistle cover  in my book  the bp cover to end all covers  [   amp  x200b  based on her vocals alone    when she used to record vocal guide tracks at yg    yg himself offered her a debut which she rejected  she later served a stint at yg as a producer  ,1,290,56
rosie s building a nice vinyl collection i see,1,46,8
doesn t it eat your battery ,1,28,5
  we need more of wavy haired jennie in our lives    ,1,53,11
i know this made lisa so happy,1,30,7
she s about to get hit with the dj snake treatment,1,50,10
she was my first bias too  i need this so bad ,1,46,11
i already bought tickets to see them in london  but i just happen to be in taipei for work and i m seriously considering ditching work and going to watch the show here on sunday   i must be a crazy blink ,1,204,39
oooo dope live wallpaper  i ve never seen one working on an iphone before  ,1,75,13
how many more fire emojis must i see  and not think this is related to their comeback    ,1,89,17
looking to sell 2 tickets for 109 row 6  msg if interested  ,1,60,12
honestly  i ve never heard a good blackpink cover  i don t understand why no one seems able to sing their songs well  it s often the jisoo part that gets messed up the most as they don t seem able to go low to high like she does  i would say this singer has a great voice and probably a good idea to slow it down for her voice but still not a fan of this cover  it s definitely  worlds better than the slowed down hyuna red cover last year  that woman trashed one of my favorite kpop songs ,1,490,96
it s actually a moving wallpaper  i edited all the clips to fit 30 seconds in  i used intolive to add a wallpaper and make it into a live photo  ,1,145,29
dumb question  but is your wallpaper a gif  or is this post just a history of all your wallpapers put into a gif  ,1,114,23
listen up yg   the people clearly want an acoustic version of ddu du duu du    ,1,79,17
i adore this hair on her ,1,25,6
she is really so cute    ,1,25,6
this is art,1,11,3
low key this would make a sick comeback hairdo ,1,47,8
i never knew i needed blonde jisoo till now  ,1,45,9
what a look,1,11,3
wow jisoo speaking chinese,1,26,4
it was lit really added another dimension to the performances ,1,62,10
is the first picture from her instagram  ,1,41,7
please share this,1,17,3
yes  yes  yes  if they want new fans  new universes new igot7s new onces  you gotta let in the blinks and armys  and i think that they should be grateful for blackpink only having 9 songs  if they didn t  we might spend all our time focusing on their songs  during their hiatus  we find new bands and we feel a need to explore and look into other bands   lt 3 all the while our hearts still remain with lisa  rose  jisoo  and jennie   lt 3 ,1,440,83
that head shimmy tho ,1,21,4
jazzy cover  love it,1,20,4
anyone here who s going to watch blackpink in sydney alone  ,1,60,10
there s a bonnet  unisex clothes  slippers etc,1,46,7
wow  this is awesome  any chance you can share it ,1,50,10
can u let us know how u did this  ,1,34,10
jisoo speaking english   is this heaven ,1,40,5
lalisa fans unite  lt 3,1,23,4
oh wow this is so impressive  i love all the shots you got of lisa and her charms  ,1,83,18
chaeyoung as well,1,17,3
jisoooyaaaa we love youuuuuu and your cute acceeeeeeeeenttttttttttttttt,1,71,8
they ve been on plenty of variety shows  idol room  weekly idol  knowing bros  running man  etc   also they have their own reality show in blackpink house which has 48 episodes and some extras  i m not meaning it as an insult but you re taking it that way  the question was merely if there was a role for  no jam  who would have that role in your group  i can confidently say from all the interactions  shows  and videos i have seen online that jennie is the least talkative and is the most  no jam   if you re a real blink you wouldn t even be trying to deny this  unless you don t want to admit it because you think it s inherently negative ,1,643,117
exactly  by the way  the last five words are spoken in mandarin  meaning  we are waiting for you            so cute ,1,116,22
and jeongyeon is the nojam of twice ,1,36,7
i think right now there are still tickets for a  b and c reserve tickets are still available,1,92,18
jisoo speaking in english is  everything   ,1,43,6
the tickets released today were presale  does that mean it was limited and there ll be more tickets on general release   asking for a friend,1,140,25
i also think this is kwon jin ah  this is too good ,1,51,12
did she get to the next round ,1,30,7
just voted while commuting to work  is it unlimited votes per day  i knew   recognized a surprisingly number of the nominees    lol  ,1,133,23
hoping that more pictures will be taken of these two bffs together like in la ,1,78,15
anyone care to enlighten me on what are the chances of successfully bringing a mirrorless camera to bp concert  ,1,112,19
i would say ros   she is not funny in a funny way  unintentionally she makes me lol most of the time  ,1,102,21
that s so true  bigbang was when i started kpop but i just listened to them casually since my gf was into them  it was only when i stumbled onto bp that i really got into kpop  then from just following them it exposed me to other kpop music that i wouldn t have discovered myself  bp is still my  1 group but i can appreciate the music other kpop artists put out  i think ppl need to realize bp and bts is everywhere now and has become part of mainstream music  it s so easy to stumble into their music and then soon go down the rabbit hole and discover other kpop artists either by yourself or through social media algorithms that recommend you more kpop ,1,656,124
can i have the first pic in a high res  thanks ,1,47,11
you gotta let me know about your experience t_t,1,47,9
can you share it with us ,1,25,6
it s perfect because this is how kids understand it  ,1,53,9
but how would you know if they ve never been in variety shows that much  i think no jam concept applies only in variety show appearances  if the basis are v lives  then i understand  jennie is the   damage control when it comes to the three lol ,1,245,44
they call someone  no jam  when they re awkward in variety shows  i actually knew this term because of seulgi  seulgi is the no jam of red velvet  ,1,147,25
so gooood ,1,10,2
i neeeeeeeeeed it,1,17,3
just bought reserve a tickets for sydney  does anyone know what 41 1 row d means  i seriously don t know how the numbering works ,1,129,23
how d you do this ,1,18,4
okay so i have a few on my wishlist which is probably not gonna happen  1  really dark concept and a mv with hidden meanings  or just mv with black and white effect  but then again any mv with blackpink is stunning  2  i want teddy to experiment with different sounds such as tropical house  dream pop etc 3  one side track could be rnb and another one could be a ballad or a slow paced acoustic track  and it would be amazing if the title track is a mix of trap  hip hop and pop  i would be eternally grateful   but then again  i know stay did not do that well in charts  and is really underrated  so blackpink might not include that kind of song  4  at least let jennie and lisa write their own raps  people like to drag them for not always writing their raps  but like we know they can  from what we have seen from the sure thing cover   and bring the  special lee hi  jennie back  because her rapping there is just wow coming from a 13 year old kid  5  also let jisoo try rapping once in a while  i know she needs proper training and years of work  but she really has the potential to become a sub rapper  highly unlikely since there are two members out of four that rap  and she does not even get lines now  when she is the lead vocalist  so yeah i m being too unrealistic  6  let chaelisa have a dance break 7  bring iconic choreographies like boombayah s  and yes i know the  hit you with that dududu  part was iconic  but i was a bit disappointed with the overall choreographies  8  lisoo harmonizing is actually really nice  so teddy should utilize it more in the songs instead of always using them in the background  chaennie s is good too but i just prefer lisoo s because of all the background vocals harmonization and the iconic playing with fire harmonization they did  9  have two members in one scene like whistle s scene  or while one is singing  the others are there dancing 10  lisa without bangs or at least black hair with bangs  i saw an edit she looked so stunning 11  rosie with jet black hair please  she looked so hot in those predebut pics 12  jennie with short hair since she cannot dye her hair  and we wanna see her try somehing different cauz sis basically had the same hairstyle for about two and a half years now 13  jisoo with platinum blonde hair bishes she will wreck your biases [  14  and most importantly as long as the girls love what they are doing  i know that we blinks will love this comeback,1,2436,451
awesome  ,1,9,2
just voted,1,10,2
cute cover hahah,1,16,3
what s the actual definition of no jam  ub made me more confused ,1,65,11
forgot to mention  this was during the kl concert,1,49,9
yes there are  plastic  works well   ,1,37,6
wow never knew i needed this until now,1,38,8
wow   great job,1,15,4
i was able to in the singapore concert  they will be entering the stage from different locations so people usually run towards their side when they enter  that s when you can squeeze through the gaps  ,1,201,36
wow amazing,1,11,2
i ll be going to the event alone as well  flying in from phx ,1,61,13
will there be more seats open for general sale ,1,47,9
yeah you have to go via live nation s website as that contains a special link that contains the pre sale code to ticketek  otherwise it won t let you actually purchase ,1,168,29
i ve bought through kpoptown numerous times  and they ve always been awesome  though i do always pick the fastest shipping to aus ,1,130,21
yeah live nation had lots of problems  especially at the start ,1,63,11
from what i ve seen  they will  every ticket this time around had limited availability for presale plus they have that amex customer promotion so i m sure they d have the all the ticket types available again on the 1st once everything has settled ,1,247,42
all day i dream about stars  but not patrick ,1,45,9
i didn t know shopee existed in the philippines ,1,48,8
all good  thank you trying  will they also be selling more vip tickets on the 1st,1,81,16
vip pink  d,1,11,3
it took an hour of refreshing before i secured tickets  somebody on twitter told me to keep refreshing and it eventually worked ,1,128,22
hmm    well that s really all i know tbh so one can assume the presale has sold out i m afraid    they did state that presale tickets were limited but you ll have another chance on march 1st  sorry i couldn t be of help   ,1,222,42
exactly  hope they could even sing a cantonese song someday like what iu has done before by singing kay tse s song ,1,115,21
yes i did and there was still no option for purchase ,1,53,11
is there any bp official merch for men ,1,39,8
did you login on live nation s page and then used the ticket link on their page  it should work after it redirects you to ticketek ,1,131,25
sorry i wouldn t have a clue ,1,29,6
i got to the page that showed all the tickets and their prices but there was no button that i could click to continue the purchase ,1,131,26
i speak cantonese and it s actually fun listening to them attempting to speak   ,1,80,14
i had the same problem as well when trying to buy tickets for sydney but for me it was more so people holding the tickets without actually buying them rather than the tickets being sold out  i managed to get 3 pink vip tickets after waiting a bit after the holders  timer expired ,1,280,53
1  they been doing the same set list at each concert  anybody got a link to one  2  anybody have experience with merch shipping to australia  official or non official  3  anybody been to a concert yet that knows how early the merch lines were open beforehand ,1,259,47
any experience with buying bp goods from overseas that send to melbourne  want to wear something to the gig just in case the merch is all gone on the night i m after   ,1,168,32
this is a cool version  she has a nice voice ,1,45,10
i got 2 a reserve tickets for sydney and booked my flights from nz  d i m so excited ,1,85,18
pink vip  stoked ,1,17,3
a lot of people think its kwon jin ah from antenna music ,1,57,12
beautiful voice,1,15,2
ohh noice ,1,10,2
personally  i m hoping that it s a  pink  track with melodic chorus this time  but if the dj snake collab still stands  considering he s following them again   i m guessing it would be  black  ,1,193,32
i m in s17 1 toooo,1,18,4
i m in s17 1 whatever that means  i had to buy for everyone if we want to sit together  my poor bank account  i had to click livenation buy link repeatedly until it redirected me to tiketek  intially i thought it did nothing    but after 20 minutes it finally worked for me ,1,274,51
wts   selling 4 tix to blackpink s in your area world tour section 208 row 11  selling at  190  please message me if you re interested  taking paypal  ,1,151,27
1x a reserve  kpop friends are a myth for me lol  i m in s13  where you lot at and did u buy for everyone  i had to check twitter of livenation and ticketek to know what was going on ,1,183,39
i managed to get 4 a reserves  can t wait to go with my friends  d,1,66,15
i know it s meaningless  but i d love it if bp won ,1,51,11
looks like i m going to australia for a small vacation  just got my tickets  any locals that can give tips on what to do while in melbourne ,1,140,27
i think she can be funny in her own right but i am just comparing her to the rest of bp who are by comparison more entertaining and extroverted than her ,1,153,31
but jennie is such a hit on michuri  i almost said jennie  too  but then i remembered her running man and michuri appearances  ,1,127,23
troy sivan is our representative  would ve thought 5sos were more popular with kids ,1,84,13
i would have to say   rosie  it s a difficult choice to make since they barely go on variety shows  but so far  it s ros   give her more amazing saturday variety shows and she ll shine  ,1,186,34
yeah  i was sad too  i really think it s silly too  i guess it gets a bad rap because it s popular  but what they don t understand is bp and bts are sort of kpop gateway drugs for new fans  i like twice now  but i wouldn t get into twice if it wasn t for bp  and i knew about redvelvet before  but i wouldn t have started really listening to their songs if it wasn t for bp  and bts  if only they knew  they should have a sign that s like  come for bp bts  stay for pentagon  or whatever   which is now my second fave boy group  may one day surpass bts  idk   but alas      ,1,574,114
has been there been a set of merchandise repeated at each concert pretty much viewable anywhere ,1,96,16
got my ticket ,1,14,3
ugh  that was fun trying to get a ticket   got one though  bp in june   woot ,1,77,14
who is it tho ,1,14,4
ah ok thanks for the info  yeah hopefully we can see a couple of performances  i love seeing the outfits that the stylist comes up with  ,1,137,26
i hate yg for his treatment for bp but i purposely don t do it because it seems like its part of the anti bp narrative there ugh ,1,129,26
i can t even answer the first question  i don t care for any of those shows ,1,76,15
i was completely joking but i appreciate the education  the eu consists 28 countries  europe is at least    29 countries  ,1,122,20
this isn t an insult to them  i m not saying their dances need to be more tiring i m just saying they have the potential to do a lot better choreography and their choreographer needs to amp it up  they make it look good and entertaining because they re good dancers but they can easily do more  ,1,295,54
the dances aren t suppose to be challenging so fans can do it too  how do you think dddd dance is so iconic and recognizable  plus they have to sing while dancing so their voice needs to be stable ,1,197,38
just voted   i didnt know if i had to complete all 31 artists  but voted all the way to the end eventhough they re listed on 1st question  poll lol  wanted to make sure my vote will count xd,1,190,38
this is should be easy if blinks just vote consistently ,1,56,10
the whole time i was hoping thered be an option to skip the first 26 questions bahaha,1,85,17
there aren t words strong enough to describe how gorgeous she is ,1,65,11
no full bangs for lisa  let us blinks see the light   ,1,54,11
i had to answer 26 questions to get to them lol  it s worth it ,1,63,14
let s get them their first western award  ,1,42,7
europe and the eu aren t the same thing  the uk can leave the eu  they can t leave europe ,1,90,18
don t know and don t care  since we blinks are here to support them ,1,68,13
kca takes brexit seriously  ,1,28,4
irene  jennie     ,1,18,3
i like how the uk isn t in europe,1,33,8
he said mid to late march  so that doesn t give them much time to promote because coachella is the first and second weekend of april  lets say the release on march 23rd  that s only maybe a week and a half of promotion  ,1,220,42
she has the prettiest eyes ever omg,1,35,7
vote [here]  ,1,13,2
blackvelvet is such a powerful combination  ,1,44,6
i am crossing my fingers for more parris goebel choreo  ,1,56,10
they need a new choreographer  i m hoping to see super good choreo this comeback  all of their dances don t seem to be very challenging and a lot of the time they don t really go with the song  they re all good dancers they really need to up their choreo game   as for music i ll literally take anything at this point i just need new music lol,1,343,65
they have a 5 week break during march   april  i m hoping their comeback happens early in that break so we can see some music show performances ,1,144,27
another international date ,1,27,3
 gt red velvet s irene and blackpink s jennie will be attending paris fashion week on march 05  irene will be attending the fashion show on behalf of the italian fashion brand  miu miu  while jennie will be representing chanel  the blackvelvet duo first became friends when they used to go to the same hair salon together  since then they have shown affection for each other on numerous occasions ,1,397,66
i honestly know this a reach and probably won t ever happen but i d really love a hard hitting  full on hip hop track and just let jennie and lisa go off  give it a dancebreak with wild choreo just for lisa  i kinda want them to lean darker for at least one track  most importantly i just want something new,1,307,60
they re part of the hi tech dance crew of yg  a google search of  kwon twins  will give you a list of articles etc ,1,115,23
because they have back pain in their area ,1,42,8
i just want another comeback  but if i can be a little greedy  i would love another bop like their earlier songs  pwf  bby  whistle  and even better choreo too  i remember being slightly let down with dddd and fy s choreo when they first came out  i wonder how the music show appearances will work out  considering bp is still on their tour ,1,341,63
nice  i m glad you found one that works   ,1,42,9
oh jeez  thank you  i checked  amp  found a side purse ita that fits the measurements  that would have sucked lol,1,113,21
i m just gonna wait til yg officially announces if he does  the cb date and releases the teasers  ,1,98,18
the cuteness is strong with this one ,1,37,7
i only saw it from a spanish or was it brazilian source the first time around  that same source then posted it was a joke and  we   blinks  are too easily fooled  and that it was confirmed to be a cf  that is at least my current knowledge on these photos in particular  but that might be wrong so don t just take it as confirmation now hehe  ,1,342,67
was it really  i don t think i ve seen it yet or heard of it being confirmed  i ll take your word for it though  those photos looked so cool too  it would ve been interesting to see what concept they re gonna come out with  ,1,224,42
i saw that one  but that was confirmed to be a cf for some korean hotel iirc  didn t think of it because that was recently ,1,123,25
[cf]   it was all over twitter when it was originally posted then it resurfaced again like last week cuz blinks were wondering what happened to this  cf  filming so now everyone is on edge  ,1,190,35
thanks  i only remember rumors when they filmed for some variety in some ferris wheel i think  other than that nothing i can recall  d,1,134,25
i ve had the beach concept of a video for for ever young going on in my head ever since i heard it  however it is totally different from the usual k pop video in that it doesn t focus on the group  ,1,198,40
i really want to see dark hair ros  and a different hairstyle for lisa  i would love short hair jisoo  ,1,103,20
sure  i can try to find the post on twitter and link it here for you guys girls  ,1,81,17
i actually have no specific wishes really  other than maybe getting another  black  side as the title track but hell i would enjoy almost anything from them probably  i am just confident that they are able to make any concept work quite honestly  for the title track it is imo more important to publish something the general public likes  the other songs on the ep can be more experimental if teddy wants to go for it  d,1,420,77
jisoo with long hair is a fkin  goddess tbh  we ll see ,1,55,11
wow  if they go that route  i can see another song more similar to aiiyl  gonna be hyped,1,88,18
yes  i so wish they had a music video for forever young or really or see you later it would ve been so cool,1,107,23
can you dig that up  i don t remember that at all honestly,1,58,12
i m guilty of buying more adidas than i would have because of blackpink    i know it s an ad but i m ok with that ,1,114,24
to be fair  bp threads on  will have comments defending the girls  it s elsewhere in non bp related threads  when the girls get brought up that they re delegated to being the butt of the same old jokes  ,1,203,36
any thoughts on what hair colours styles they d sport this comeback  i recently saw a fan edited [pictures]   of jisoo with short hair and she looks amazing  i think she spoke recently about wanting to cut her hair shorter too ,1,227,39
sick  just when i thought i knew everything there is to know about these girls  lisa ringa linga cameo   ,1,105,19
i really hope we get 2 mv s like before   ,1,42,10
that s kind of my point though  yg as a company is trash  ,1,58,12
red velvet had 3 comebacks in 2018 with 2 english songs     each one of those comeback albums were quality af  i dunno why people think quality takes that much time  it doesn t  ,1,178,31
but there s a balance in kpop  a good kpop company will maximize revenue by utilizing their employees and their employees talent  yg does not do that  at all  i m still infuriated that lee hi keeps getting buried by yg  anyone could tell you out of the big 3 that yg is the absolute worst and many of us wish the other 2 would just steal all the yg artists away so they can get some real support  you bet your ass jyp or sm would take advantage of those situations  imagine blackpink under jyp or sm   amp  x200b  tl dr  yg is terrible business and doesn t innovate  bp deserve better,1,584,108
i remember back in oct maybe november there was photos of filming set that people said was for a cf  but it looked too fancy extra for it just to be a cf  the theme looked like a beach fresh vibe to it  haven t really heard much since it was announced so maybe it was there comeback mv shoot  it s all speculations but i m just really excited    ,1,346,66
 gt itzy s debut song is horrible but they have the power of jyp fanboys behind them so it was never going to flop  i don t visit  anymore but i think it s only natural the front page is spammed with itzy posts as they ve just debuted  it s hilarious you say that  this is   exactly the same type of shit   haters at  say about bp   all of bp songs are horrible but they have the power of yg fangirls so it charts and never flops  this ladies and gentlemen is a good example  if you can feel so pressed and salty like that about itzy   a group that just debuted not long ago  and only has one song for feelings to be harbored think about how much more pressed and saltier non blinks feel against bp    they are wildly successful with an unconventionally smaller discography and although i love his beats teddy s style isn t for everyone  some people genuinely think that their songs are too similar and not their cup of tea so they get salty when bp gets success after success if you say your opinions on itzy were genuine and not fueled by fandom hate  then not that hard to see why bp gets hate like that too lol  although i disagree  most of the people saying stuff like that already stan a group company they like  including you ,1,1233,229
its a bit different though  drake lebron etc have had opportunities to actually work to be at the top  bp has had so few opportunities its disgusting that yg is still somehow keeping them down  as a blink i actually want them to work     yg just doesn t seem to like to let them  give me new music  ,1,299,56
nah not really  in reality its kind of a fanboy girl thing on both sides  the op is obviously frustrated that no one is massively upvoting bp content in there  many there don t feel bp needs more publicity so they downvote it  nothing new in the reddit world  ,1,260,47
there s harmonizing and then there s being part of a chorus  the example of jisoo is whistle doesn t really apply to this song  in whistle she s playing a supporting role  her voice volume is lowered and distorted as well  so it s less about being able to id her tone  but noticing that it s even there  in this case  they re at full voice  again  i m not here calling bullshit  but it s more that even if it is them  what s it matter even if it doesn t sound like them  ,1,471,86
wow  i guess i m glad i never set foot in  sounds like a toxic cesspool over there  ,1,84,17
lisa better be careful with these looks cause shes gonna make the camera catch on fire one of these days    ,1,108,21
her accent    ,1,14,3
my god she is so pretty,1,23,6
they re just salty that bp is doing better overseas than rv  don t get me wrong  they re both two groups of queens   is just very biased toward the latter ,1,155,28

adorable  ,1,10,2
i know  they re great  i m selfish and want to keep them in blackpink exclusively  but oh well  i guess we gotta share with the rest of yg  ,1,140,27
remind me who the kwon twins are   i should look them up  but could you direct me to the best place to find them  ,1,114,24
thanks  that makes me so happy  i really appreciate it because kpop dance is some of my favorite parts  ,1,104,19
thankyou thankyou thankyou  i shall go fangirl over them now  ,1,62,10
i forgot about the guys  i ve only seen 3 for blackpink  but i ll have to look them up  do you know if they were on  bang bang bang   or the 2015 incarnation of hi tech  ,1,170,34
it most certainly did and is still ongoing  seeing it happen again in real time with bp is just as exhausting and kinda soul crushing tbh   i hate the edgy  it s mainstream  so now it sucks  vibe  too reactionary and childish ,1,226,41
i m not so sure but some said there were the twin brothers at seungri concert  i personally think that most of yg s dancers have been working for x academy  leading to this problem ,1,181,33
the back up dancers  winner was touring in america so several of their dancers where with them  i read that yge has lost so many staff members  but yeah it s ridiculous they are so short on staff  they should have more than 8 dancers  ,1,235,44
i agree with you,1,16,4

i don t see this  is it on the front of the physical ticket i m starting to doubt if i bought the vip ticket   ,1,111,23
jennie looks so cute with the space buns  we re nearing the end of the asia leg of their tour  i really hope the comeback is imminent  ,1,135,26
well from what i ve seen  there was a legislation on june 2018 where tickets can t be resold for more than 10  for nsw  ,1,120,23
bullshit  they were never sad for her  go look back at the threads  they used that vlive  btw she never even hinted at the possibility of bp not coming back  as another chance to bash yg and yge,1,194,38
she s so cute with her lil hair buns uwu mandeukie ,1,51,10
i think its the sections where you will be placed  at the moment i have no clue because the venue map is still not showing up ,1,126,26
do they really deserve an american debut  lucian grange from umg sems to think so  paul tollett  founder of coachella seems to think so  grammy winner dua lipa seems to think so  but a few disgruntled kpop fans on reddit and elderly gma viewers disagree  so i guess all of the experts are wrong   i thought bp did great on colbert  the gma performances were a bit shaky and the backing tracks were way too loud  but they did amazing during the interviews  they will be fine  as long as they have a decent comeback and put on a solid  live performance at coachella  which they are 100  capable of doing  they will still have many opportunities to shine in the us  ,1,663,123
don t be ridiculous lol  the  quality gt quantity  point doesn t mean it should take them over a year to make a comeback  the hate on bp is stupid but i understand where they re coming from  it s hard to stan a group with 9 songs in over 2 years  and you simply cannot defend that with  quality gt quantity  ,1,308,54
what s the difference between all the reserves ,1,47,7
remember the  jennie is lazy  period  they did the same tactic  i like jennie but     then you check their profile it s either a new account or a bts fan  they even make posts over here with fresh accounts with their fake concern  makes you think ,1,247,44
i mean as a fan i m also very disappointed it s only 9 songs  and that for some astronomical prices  like it s borderline exploitative from yg s side  i ve been to concerts that were a lot more content dense and cheaper ,1,220,39
which is why i avoid that subreddit in general and even unsubbed ,1,65,12
blackpink is the first kpop group i like and i wanted to subscribe to  to find more  but you guys are scaring me lol  you make it sound like everyone s at each other s threats there  ,1,183,35
i m old blink 2   they are just great,1,37,8
jealouay of the fans haha,1,25,5
 quality gt quantity  nocap  me,1,31,3
its the same reason why so many people hate on drake  lebron  cristiano ronaldo  and so on     when you are at the top  there is never a shortage of envy and jealousy also don t forget that there are a special race of   mentally ill snowflakes   contrarians who likes to do the opposite of everything ,1,301,54
u have a small phone screen,1,27,6
honestly both bts and bp have become hated in  and mostly in the industry because they have gone mainstream in america  because they have gotten so popular i think people think they re overrated  but then again  i don t spend my time on the  subreddit as much  all we can do is just ignore the hate because bp is thriving right now  and that is great ,1,351,65
melbourne ticket   price         a reserve    203 50 general admission    183 15 b reserve    152 60 c reserve    101 70 black package    510 45 pink package    357 75 ,1,168,29
imagine if blackpink will pass 100m views in the first day,1,58,11
unless it s red velvet  they obsess about red velvet and their bias against big3 melts away for that group ,1,107,19
my favorite is  no offense to the girls  they re very talented but     proceeds to bash the girls for 3 paragraphs straight   i swear i ve seen that template dozens of time  i don t visit  much now because of this but everytime there s some exciting bp news i check it out and sure enough it s always the same comments  oh  and can t forget about the fact that they have 9 songs ,1,379,69
its even stated on the vip ticket itself   its about 5 days before the event starts that you will receive more information about the event  ,1,140,25
what about my little old boy  blackpink appears on that show in episode 97,1,74,14
both jisoo and ros  are really hood at harmonizing  you know  so there s the possibility that you are trying to listen to their voices based on how they sing rn  did u hear jisoo s voice when she was harmonizing during whistle too  ,1,232,42
how worried should us aussie s be of ticket scalpers  i know for a fact wa has intro d a legislation where ticket s can only be resold 10  of what the original price was  if that makes sense lol  is this the same for nsw and victoria  ,1,235,45
it s just kpop in general  due to the herd mentality and the lack of individuality everyone has to hate the same shit  imo kpop has the most toxic behaviour  even more than 1 direction fans or beliebers,1,202,37
who cares  i love them  and i m happy about their current success  i couldn t care less what others think about bp  ,1,116,21
people hate success in general  they cant stand that a group they don t like is beating their favs  but our girls are queens  even the haters gotta admit that  ,1,160,30
oh its hilarious  one of my favorites is the  rivalry  between reveluvs and onces  then you get moments [like this]   and then [yeri calling nayeon on her birthday]   and it warmed my heart  total rivalry bahahah,1,212,36
tbh  i do not follow  but these are several reason why ppl hate blackpink i have encounter  1  the way yg media play  yg and his staff compared blackpink with other kpop idols several times  driving their fandom nuts  i particularly remembered blackpink s stylish mentioned other girlgroups and implied that their fashion style was no where near blackpink s  2  the way yg treated his other artists like cl  one  lee hi  seungri  bigbang   and more  blackpink has been undeniably viral  and has brought money a lot of money  that s why yg paid more attention than other  the other artists in yg are extremely talented  but their talent is  unfortunately  hidden in the dungeon  as for seungri  a bigbang member  has not been treated like he deserve  yg forgot his solo concert  sent him no dancers  i m not sure about the band and stylish  and even told seungri that he didn t need any backup dancers  and said that all dancers had been sent to blackpink s concert   which was absolutely annoying  bcz there were only 4 dancers in our girls  concert  what kind of entertainment company have only 4 dancers   3  some so called blinks are so immature and triggered easily for no reasons  2 example are cl s post and dj snake s following lisa on instagram  as for cl s post  some blink misunderstood cl and thought that she implied jennie  they replied with no respect to cl  as for dj snake  some ppl kept commented and dm him  saying why he followed lisa but not other members  which really annoyed him  4  jennie s scandal about no energy dance and later dating kai  actually  most ppl just hate blackpink and specifically jennie before  and later used these scandal as an excuse to hate  some exo l hate jennie for dating kai  as you can see  most of these reasons are bcz of how yg works  our girls have nothing to do with them  they have been trying so hard  jennie also improved her stamina to dance more energetically   what they need is blink s support and yg s professionalism  ,1,1985,341
i am sure most of the users of this blackpink sub are devoted blinks who have quite a high degree of rationality  i e  genuinely hoping the girls are doing their best in all aspects without sowing discords  bashing other groups or spreading fake rumours  however  as bp s fanbase is really big i can say  there are way more fans who do exactly the opposite every single day since they become a bp stan  and i genuinely feel hopeless about this  because this is what the very present generation looks like     sigh,1,513,91
that s not the point im making dude  in my opinion d4  love scenario  killing me or idol all would have been fine as soty  some blinks took it so bad  they started bombarding all twice videos with hatecomments and it just shines a bad light on the whole fandom  and any award worldwide isnt fair  its mostly not about popularity or how much of a banger your song is  but about how many cds you sold and if you attend the show  and while blackpink is becoming the biggest kpop group in the western world  twice was still selling more cds in the asian market  korea japan   dont t get me wrong i feel betrayed aswell  because bp won so little  but it s not the blame of the other artists ,1,686,128
oh shit i can hear jennie clearly and kind of rosie  and possibly jisoo  okay you know what i have no idea i have officially failed as a blink ,1,143,29
 gt  take song of the year awards for example  some toxic blinks are all over themselves  because another group won  while not understanding  that the other group sold more cds in that region  i m assuming you mean mama where they hate yg artists and bp didn t even attend  blinks have every reason to shit on that award show and the winner should ve been love scenario or dddd  the reaction and discussion around it is perfectly valid ,1,436,76
why are you so offended  i was talking explicitly about girlgroup fandoms and there is a part of blinks and lisa stans shitting on every twice video  leave alone music videos  take song of the year awards for example  some toxic blinks are all over themselves  because another group won  while not understanding  that the other group sold more cds in that region  i love blackpink  but how some fans can t be peaceful is a real bummer to me  and yeah i know that boygroup stans are toxic aswell  but the one you mean is the biggest and most active fandom in the world  so i get why there are so many toxic people  im not defensing them  because im not part of their stuff at all ,1,679,127
i dunno about this  i m not going to go as far as to call bullshit here but you d have to distort rosie s and jisoo s voices to high hell for me to not be able to pick them out  i can maybe hear jennie s voice in there  but that s about it  ,1,241,50
i totally agree with you  just from what ive experienced i have the feeling that blackpink has a higher percentage  some are so obsessed theyre not only trashing on other groups  but even on their non fav blackpink members  ,1,224,38
most of the hate comes from jype fanboys  they are so insecure and jealous that bp has made their favourite group irrelevant  any person who is commenting negative bullshit against bp  you go to their post history or just look at their flair  80  of the time they are jyp drones  other times it s bts fans  i urge all of you to visit rkpop when bp news is announced and downvote or report any unnecessary bullshit negative comments ,1,432,78
oh plz  i don t think most blinks give a rats ass about twice  it s usually bp video s being descended upon by other fandoms looking to spread hate especially that other big boy group fandom that i shall not name  just look at the videos when bp were in america as an example  so when blinks are defending their girls from these attacks they re now considered toxic and other side just feints being a victim  classic ,1,417,75
black pink is the revolution and with more success comes haters  let them waste their energy it s amusing  ,1,107,18
i learn to not look at yt comments on kpop mv s  i dont go on twice mv s cuz i dont listen to them so naturally  i wouldnt see these blinks  comments  likewise  i mainly watch blackpink mv s so i naturally see toxic comments from other fandoms like onces or army s  but this doesnt mean anything since those kinds of fans are the obsessive  aggressive and loud ones that ruin it for the rest of us  in terms of which fandom is the most toxic  it comes down to fandom size  the larger the fandom  the more bad apples there are numerically speaking  but proportion wise  it s probably the same ,1,592,109
i don t think there is choreo for that part i think they re just meant to go off and have fun,1,93,20
they perform songs on the big stage too  also they wander around and interact with the fans so i don t think you necessarily need to be in the front  if you just get a ga standing ticket there s with no priority queue then you could very well be standing all the way in the back if you don t come early and considering how big these arenas are it s very far away ,1,363,71
i d argue it s more like they re just ignored at this point  but yes it s certainly not super pretty,1,100,18
i agree  i really want vip for soundcheck though i feel the encore stage is where they spend most of the fun too  ,1,114,23
if that happens we can finally confirm that women use porn as much as men lol,1,77,16
everyone knows yg english songwriters are nothing compared to sms  theyre part of the big 3 and should hire someone to start to finally make some good english lyrics ,1,166,29
the downvotes you re getting by other fans is only proving your point  i agree stans think their group can do no wrong and that s the issue  i also think a contributing factor is that blackpink just don t have many songs but still get a lot of attention  it s not their decision to make obviously  ikon has had three albums in the last 8 months ish and blackpink has had 1  i love blackpink  but the criticism is often justified  also let s not forget that when dispatch announced their thing at the beginning of the year  was quick to shame dispatch for what they did  ,1,570,103
don t ask me  i m still pissed that orange caramel isn t a thing anymore  ,1,74,13
have you really read comments  a lot people said theyre failing to imitate blackpink and the debut song was a mess unbearable  i don t get why people have to bring up blackpink on their song at all  since it s a totally different style atleast in my opinion  just because its like a  teen crush  concept it doesnt make them a blackpink imitation ,1,346,61
tbh  is hating on any group that is popular and if i m being honest blink is being the most toxic gg fandom  atleast in the youtube comments throwing a bad light on blackpink aswell  everytime i visit youtube comments i recognize blinks trashing on other groups  especially on twice  so i get why the fandom isnt especially popular  and yes i love bp and theyre not responsible for their fandom  but i get why other people get pissed off by their fandom and might start hating because of that  also some people might be just mad  that bp is getting more attention than their favs now ,1,584,105
to be honest i haven t really noticed it  the only time i noticed anything similar was during solo when me and some other  subscribers were suggesting that they might need a break as jennie seemed unwell or tired  i ve seen and read the comments of blackpink posts on  many times since with no issues,1,300,54
i m also going to the melbourne show and i ve been debating this in my head too  i want vip mostly for the soundcheck  but i don t really want to be in the golden circle whipping my head back and forth to watch them move around the stages  and from all the videos i ve seen of their shows  that mini stage seems to be where most of the fun is at  most of their talking goes on there  encore messing around etc   so standing close as possible in front of that mini stage ga ticket seems like the better option to get a better view  but i don t know  the soundcheck is really tempting for me so i still haven t decided what to get myself   ,1,638,123
i think its bc most kpop idols are shooting cute and bp dares to be sexy so the other stans feel threatened by proxy through the idols one stans  also kpop fans are the most toxic fans out of any sort of hobby or interest not only one that i ve taken up myself but even out of the ones i m not into but just that i ve ever witnessed  kpop fans are horrible  if you dont suck their fav idols figuretive dick they go apeshit ,1,423,84
at the end of the day  this is a business  most decisions are made to maximize sales and revenue ,1,97,19
really  can you link an example of hate over there  i m subscribed to both and haven t really seen anything too bad,1,115,21
no  it s just a regular ga  i bought it on the resell market  do you know if you show up early that day  they give you a bracelet with entry time and tell you to come back then  or should i sit in line all day for the best chance at best spot  ,1,244,53
yeah a lot of the feedback i ve read from those that attended bp s concerts say the girls were really charismatic and super charming  could they have more songs  absolutely  but at the end of the day  people go to their concerts because they want to see the girls  ,1,265,48
i honestly don t know why one has to end the other  good groups can coexist  their musical styles aren t even the same  but anytime haters see a non cutesy concept  omg they coming for bp  that actually goes to show how popular bp has become though  people now look to bp as the standard and will use the girls as the measuring stick for anything not in the cutesy area  ,1,371,69
since the op says all topics are okay  i m going to ask  what other groups would you love to see in person besides blackpink  i have to admit that i would love to see apink perform live  all of them are so adorable  and it is a completely different vibe than bp  if you can watch the mr  chu m v without cracking a smile  my hat s off to you  third on my list would be a concert by the lineup that did wow thing  sinb  seulgi  chung ha and soyeon  i know they only have one song  but i m pretty sure i could handle that on loop live for an hour without getting bored  fourth on my list would be gfriend  their music is bubblegum kpop but they mix in some musical twists and references that makes it interesting  plus their dancing is top notch  finally  i would love to have been able to see 2ne1 in their heyday  i ll always have a soft spot in my heart for sandara and bom  you never forget your first   amp  x200b ,1,917,178
people like to hate things just because they re popular ,1,56,9
 gt  while everyone argues  meanwhile jennie has brunch with irene  i legit lol d when i read this    it s funny how there s so many fan wars yet the idols themselves are close and are actually friends  blackvelvet fans were well fed on january 23rd     it goes to show how immature most kpop fans are when they go hate on other people for being successful when instead they should go hype up their faves so they get that level of recognition too  ,1,448,82
although i m late to the party  discovered bp 8 days before their dddd comeback   i ve read that the bandwagon hate was also present when cube s gf debuted last year  pretty much any gg coming with a non cutesy concept will get become the next bandwagon for the bp hate train  ,1,277,49
like why do people hate blackink and bts  like i love both groups and i can t see why you could physically  hate them ,1,118,23
do you have a soundcheck ticket  i think the entry order is vip  soundcheck  everyone else ,1,91,16
how do people know it s pink punk blackpink  not doubting it  but it sounds like any other group of background vocals ,1,118,20
i m still pressed at yge for robbing us of the senior junior interaction moments between 2ne1 and bp we could have had   ,1,121,22
yup i pretty much unsubscribed at the same point  after the teasers for jennie s solo were released  when  concerned  kpop fans were likening the teasers to yge romanticizing an underaged child  like wtf  i m surprised they don t have muscle spasms from all the reaching they do  i m also sure they were absolutely foaming at the mouth that jennie was solo debuting in a packed a packed november    and we know how that went  so proud of jennie and blinks      ,1,461,80
happened on a youtube comment somewhere about the creator doing a bts video  i didn t save a screenshot  wish i did  hell  they use bts in porn too  i m guessing pornhub s going to be flooded with fans complaining with the use of bts acronym  teehee ,1,250,45
 gt  haven t even bothered with an english version  this actually bugs me a lot and makes me have a sour taste from yg  red velvet  who has 1 native speaker and 1 conversational english speaker already released two english versions of their songs and still did a world tour out of 5 members  bp has 1 less member  3 of them full english speakers  and no english song  what the hell yg  utilize the talent of your artists ffs  ,1,426,79
remember that time when g idle was suppose to end bp  exactly   ,1,64,12
yup pretty much nailed it  haters use the whole 9 song dig at the girls to back up their claim that  bp doesn t even work hard    only has 9 songs    they come from a big company so they don t deserve their success  argument  they see their faves release 2 3 comebacks a year and don t even scratch the surface of bp s popularity and success  anytime there s a new girl group with success at all it s  rip bp  or  they will end bp  yet the girls remain unbothered and become more popular than ever  and  don t work hard   they use the fact that the girls debuted with a big company to discredit their hard work and work ethic  please  it s like haters conveniently forget that literally thousands audition for big companies and each member had to fight everyone and their moms to get through their auditions to get into yg  and we re not even talking competing with fellow trainees to debut  it s like going up to someone who works at apple or microsoft and telling them they don t deserve their success in their career because they happen to work for a large tech company and not a start up    at the end of the day though  we will focus on our girls because the more haters hate the more karma rewards the girls     ,1,1218,223
it s a whole mess on twitter  it is why i stay away from there  constant fighting of the fandom and fandoms dragging one another  ,1,130,24
ill just quote jennie in this situation   youre sitting on your feelings  im sitting on my throne      ,1,103,18
the dancers known as  crazy girls  work for ygent and serve as backup dancers for all yg artists  you ll see them with bp  winner  se ungri  etc  yg recently opened up x academy  which is sort of like 1million dance studio where they provide dance lessons and you also get a chance to get noticed by ygent to be an idol or dancer  these backup dancers do double duty as teachers and choreographers there  you can see some of their choregraphy work [here]  ,1,456,82
lol    as a photographer i use the acronym bts all the time on my instagram stories and i m just waiting one day to get bombarded by armies saying i can t use it to mean behind the scenes,1,187,37

people have said you ll get notified with the info closer to the concert date ,1,78,14
except that wasn t the question,1,31,5
i mean jennie by herself can out chart their favs and she s not even the most popular one of the group  lisa   each member is a force in their own right so you can understand why bp concerts would be sold out even with 9 songs ,1,227,46
bts army get made for people even using the word  bts   behind the scenes used bts as an acronym for far longer than bts ,1,121,22
i ve been noticing this lately and it s from relatively new accounts too ,1,73,12
they bring it on themselves  blackpink doesn t ,1,47,7
true  these so called fans should be ashamed of themselves  blackpink members are close friends and are so supportive of each other  and there is literally no reason why the blinks can t do the same too ,1,203,36
hand me the downvotes  but i ll say it  this comment section is full of  they re jealous   go off i guess  that s not a strong argument  or  r kpop is toxic   but only to bp apparently  cause i never seen toxicity towards other groups unless someone screwed up   but the reason is just    the negative people are louder  there are many people who like bp there  but the people who dislike bp or were let down by them speak up more and upvote more  besides    that sub has many multis  i tend to see that many multis used to be bp fans when they debuted  but with the lack of content  they have grown resented  which doesn t justify but explains the behaviour  of course there is a small fraction of jealous and haters  but y all can t just assume that everyone who doesn t like what we like are just jaded ,1,806,147
100  true  i remember when jennie posted a vlive saying she didn t know if they were gonna comeback and people were all sad for her and bp  square up comes out dominates and they all turn their backs and hate everything bp related lmao ,1,236,44
i ve been seeing it outside of reddit  but glad to see  is giving them some slack,1,81,16
i honestly feel like people use that as an excuse to hate on them  if anything blinks should be the ones hating on yg tbh  ,1,123,25
i agree 100   the only problem is is that the fandom is so divided  there are so many ot1 ot2  and ot3s in the fandom it s ridiculous  knowing that yg plans on doing solos for the girls i feel like blinks will be even more divided when it happens  people compare their ig followers and look at it as competition lol ,1,316,60
you can do it on twitter and use blackpink hashtags  i see ppl on there all the time looking for and selling tickets ,1,117,23
who cares as long as we are united and behind bp,1,48,11
it s already up thanks  just curious if there was a sub ,1,56,11
itzy is being bullied  you sure  on every post they r all praising them  and calling them the  new blackpink   the only  hate  or the  constructive criticism  i have seen targeted towards itzy was how the debut song was  messy  and  underwhelming   but you might be right tho  i have not been keeping up with itzy posts on  lately,1,330,59
i think some of the admins are really big ones ,1,47,10
i know right  i saw alot of anti blackpink instagram accounts with the actual names  antiblackpink    ihateblackpink    antirose  etc praising itzy and declaring their love for itzy  and at this point i feel like some of these supposed itzy fans are just  stanning  because they see itzy as the rival of blackpink  like the whole thing is wtf and funny ,1,353,60
it s prob cause the bad wrap of blinks ,1,39,8
we stand legends,1,16,3
i really wish vip included an a reserve seating ticket instead of ga standing  i want all that extra shit  but i also want a chair ,1,131,26
check out  for more,1,19,4
at least from what i see it has to do with level of effort put in  barely any songs in almost 3 years  the lazy jennie controversy and yet she gets the solo  yg just throwing money around but not actually using their talents  and 9 songs  combine that with things like rv s world tour almost being overshadowed in the news by bp simply showing up in the us  solo artists like tiffany and sunmi getting glanced over as well  it rubs some folks the wrong way  makes a little bit of sense if you think about it from their standpoint  overall pretty stupid though  kpop fans tend to be a bit stupid and don t realize that the artists themselves dgaf  while everyone argues  meanwhile jennie has brunch with irene  ,1,710,130
because most kpop fans are immature and can t stand when groups they don t deem worthy succeed without their fandom and support  ,1,129,21
wow amazing thumbs up to them,1,29,6
asia tour was around 2 hours   9 songs  with a kia commercial and the fan mashup video contest  a part where the amazing live band show their skills  2 encore songs  4 solo performances  also 1 cover of another group s song  ,1,225,41
as though one group s success is dependent on the failure of another  it s just stupid  ,1,88,15
after attending their concert i m lowkey hoping their new songs will feature their live band  as the actual musicians playing  ,1,127,20
i m currently stanning itzy now  came for ryujin since she was my bae in mixnine and stayed for yuna  love that i have 2 girlcrush ggs to stan again like my 2nd gen years of old with 2ne1 and 4minute  i think itzy s like a shiny new toy for  lots of new content  still in a discovering stage  they were like that with bp too during their debut days  except for a few blackjacks that were bitter that 2ne1 got sacked and wrongly put their anger on the bp girls instead of the company  just wait and see  when itzy also gets too much success for the sub s liking  they will shit on them too and move on to the next new thing ,1,623,123
them and itzy have been getting bullied to hell and back,1,56,11
sigh no brisbane  anyone know when will the comeback ep be released  before this   rose solo in her home country   ,1,115,22
as an australian  it s probs cheaper to ship from korea  i think our exchange rate is more forgiving as well ,1,109,20
are they the same dancers who are on tour now  ,1,47,10
buy ahead  when i went to big bang  the light sticks sold out more than three hours before doors opened ,1,104,20
9 songs ,1,8,2
it s funny because they treat the other yg artists as abuse victims that needs to be supported and saved from the dungeon  while bp after surviving a year in the dungeon and receiving success after success  get shit on ,1,219,39
what s that taylor swift line  oh yeah   haters gonna hate  hate  hate  hate  hate  as long as we the blinks support and love them  who cares what butthurt mfs think after all  blackpink is the revolution  ,1,206,36
it s so hard to get into their heads that concerts isn t just about the music  it s also about the performance  interactions  seeing your faves in the flesh  each blackpink song is a hit and their magnetic charisma is like no other  while their faves probably have multiple albums and are stuck in smaller venues ,1,313,54
hey everyone this is my first time commenting here and i came to ask for some tips  i have floor tickets  no vip  to their la concert but never bought ga tickets before  also as a short 5 2 female have mild buyer s remorse about whether i should ve done this  do you think i should try to stand as close to the main stage as possible  or near the far end of that catwalk  and for a short girl  is it actually better to be a little farther away than to be up close and have a tall person in front of me  second question  how ga entry works  i was watching tv when bts came to staples center in la and all these people were lined up in the morning for entry bracelets  for non vips  would that also be the case for bp  the earlier you line up  the better chances for getting in earlier  i feel like if i entered at 7  1 hr before show  i d likely get the worst leftover floor spots  any tips are appreciated for a first timer  ,1,925,183
its jealousy because blackpink is backed by yg money  they felt its unfair as if money can bring you fame if you have no talent  true money can open a lot of doors but you play with the cards you are dealt with  certain fandom was due to the fact bp is coming to an area where they felt they owned  ,1,299,61
well yes bts has ppl defending them that doesn t mean they don t get hate  bp don t get as much support on  b c the fandom doesn t even use reddit or they ve left already realizing a what a dumpster fire that place is  if you want to see how savage the bp fandom can be try saying something negative of them on twitter or instagram you ll get torn to pieces ,1,358,68
one thing bp gets shade for is because they exploded in popularity in less time and with less songs than some of the groups they like  in their minds this makes them  undeserving    obviously i disagree with this and think it makes no sense but it happens   a lot of the yg hate i see isn t necessarily directed towards the girls in bp it seems more about people hating how he manages the group  that s just what i ve seen  i started typing a really long response to this but [i remembered this video by prozd]   and honestly it explains it better than i can and it s way more entertaining than my ramblings ,1,608,111
the biggest problem i think exists  which is a problem i have with a lot of the big groups  is that stans so often think their group can do no wrong  release a bad song  impossible  i think a lot of the hate for bp comes from the fact that do they really deserve an american debut  they are talented for sure  but they are debuting with one of their worst songs  imo   haven t even bothered with an english version  don t get me wrong  i like bp and they re one of my top gg  but every single one of their american appearances has made me cringe  ,1,547,106
i don t know  as another comment here said  any bad comment about bts gets downvoted into oblivion and they have fans there to back them up  literally no one defends blackpink hate at all though and they re basically the punching bag of ,1,237,42
 gt  and i believe  jiyeonl_ is a stylist    for them but i m not sure her exact role  she does their make up ,1,110,22
i think it s cause  pays more attention to outside the big3 so the users think they can hate groups from the big3,1,113,22
why not relist it on ticketmaster ,1,34,6
 gt success simply attracts haters  that will never change  100  agree  this can be applied to anything really  games  anime  movies and tv shows  ,1,147,23
this is just a guess but other concerts it was like 2 hours before concert start to get inside and soundcheck was maybe 2 hours before that so soundcheck would start like 3 or 4pm,1,179,35
there seems to be hatred in from a lot of kpop fans for dubious reasons  just enjoy the music  support the groups and stop worrying about who has more views or accolades  note this is not directed at anyone simply an observation in reference to the hateful demeaning and disgusting attitudes seen in some kpop fandoms  particularly those of the various girl groups  ,1,366,62
is there a particular subreddit to buy sell trade kpop tickets  looking to let go my set of tickets since i purchased another set to get closer to the centre ,1,158,28
no setlist has been released yet but it will be longer than their asia tour since new music is coming ,1,102,20
yeah i ordered from bighits shop once and it was probably my worst financial decision because of the shipping     17 is chump change compared to that lol,1,153,27
usually when i bought from korea  shipping was 25 30   ,1,55,10
i just checked my receipt and my shipping was like  17   but i ordered some other stuff to make it worth it lol  i don t know when it will arrive because one of my other items was a preorder and i think they might ship it all together  but i think when it finally ships it will only take a few days ,1,299,63
i find the rose vocal technique comment funny especially when she made some youtube reactors tear up b c of her  eyes closed  cover ,1,132,23
make sure you double check with the venue to see if they ll let you in with one  i know some places are getting more strict with backpack style bags ,1,149,28
i was about to make this same post  i thought i was imagining it or that it s just something all fans experience with their groups  but i ve definitely noticed a bias  i also get annoyed when people offer  constructive criticism  by just repeating things they ve heard other people say  like the whole thing about rose using the wrong vocal technique  one person made a comment about it and suddenly every anti jumped on it and became a vocal expert ,1,450,79
i ve also bought from this site  i think it s cheaper without the ridiculous shipping times  ,1,93,15
when talking about the tour  i read hate saying they didn t deserve arena tours because they only have 9 songs  they sold out so they must be doing something right  ,1,165,30
again though  negative opinions on other groups in a bp subreddit is just bad form  other than the fact it s off topic  sharing those opinions in a place where other fanbases can t defend their biases creates hostility where none need exist  don t you agree ,1,258,43
as a somi stan  i ve seen all that hate ever since ioi ended  it was present the entire time  it s just intensified since itzy approached debut ,1,144,26
hate that sht they pull off as  constructive criticism  when they re just outrightly bashing lol  made me unsub after seeing those justifications,1,145,22
i ve said this before  but there are a large segment of salty blackjacks that reside in  who hate blackpink for even existing  it s not enough to hate yg for doing 2ne1 dirty  they ve got to extend that hatred to a group of young women who have nothing to do with it ,1,267,51
he didn t like the song  that s his opinion  hate is when you actively go out of your way downvote posts of other groups or make inflammatory remarks about them on a personal level ,1,181,33
i know you already said it but imo  alot has to do with yge hate in general  bp is their most popular group so the boygroups are generally ignored  like most of that sub is indifferent at least relative to their success  towards them and some also hate on them  things might ve changed slightly for ikon last yr tho  also someone said bts gets the most hate in  that sub is full of armies wym  any hate against them gets downvoted to oblivion and has so much comments defending them while bp literally has no one defending them it seems like  even innocent comments about bp  like praising a member  gets downvoted in mt experience lol ,1,636,115
i just ordered one from choice music la  it s like  35 plus shipping ,1,69,13
i also have this question,1,25,5
we don t meed any negativity directed at other groups in a bp subreddit  two wrongs don t make a right ,1,103,19
welcome to the world of kpop fandoms  enjoy your stay ,1,54,10
the most common form of  hate  i saw towards bp is mostly dismissive in nature  things like  bp only has high yt views due to their fandom    any bp song is called good because of their fandom    bp is only popular because they re from yg   and the most repetitive comment yet   they only have 9 songs   dismissing a group s success due to their fanbase doesn t make any sense to me since you need a fanbase to get big  right  bp didn t start out with all these fans  bp being successful due to only yg is also a weak point since bp had to get into yg first before becoming bp  for the yt views  sure  some of it is due to fandom streaming but it s still something significant ,1,677,128
best decision you ve ever made  i remember seeing the american gods trailer  with bp s d4 dance  posted in  and the people in the community kept on reporting it that [this]   had to be posted in the comments  crazy  ,1,216,38
it depends on whether or not they plan well or not  bts has thousands of extra and didn t run out their entire tour  and they sold batteries   but red velvet sold our repeatedly   at least in la  so if you want to be safe i would buy it ahead of time but i think they re likely following bts s model  ,1,301,60
what site is the best to buy  i some places have crazy markups,1,62,13
itzy s debut song is horrible but they have the power of jyp fanboys behind them so it was never going to flop  i don t visit  anymore but i think it s only natural the front page is spammed with itzy posts as they ve just debuted ,1,231,44
there is most certainly a bias against blackpink on  but i also am proud to see people calling out and countering the hate comments  i saw a few users  ones i recognized as posters on here  calling out the trite  new album is just going to be english remix blah blah blah  comments and actually getting more upvotes than the original  joke  ,1,341,62
yeah i wasnt a fan of dddd but i feel that people are way too aggressive with the bp hate  majority of things the girls have absolutely 0 control over so i dont get why people blame them ,1,187,38
 gt    another part of is there is a some jealousy when a group with only 9 songs have achieved so much in a relatively short time  they think bp didn t have to work as hard to get to where they are and so resentment creeps in  that s why these anti s always make predictions like  how they expect to do a world tour with only 9 songs   then it blows their mind when bp sells out their concerts and makes them hate bp even more  yes  some fans are invested in thinking that there needs to be  blood on the dance floor  for a group to be  successful   but bp s fame proves that s not a necessary ingredient  ,1,607,117
yikes i didn t know they had it this bad    good thing i unsubscribed long ago ,1,79,16
we don t know for sure right now  since we have new music coming it will definitely be longer than the asia tour  which was about 1 5 2 hours according to people who attended ,1,175,32
pretty much    ,1,15,3
kpop fandoms is a toxic culture  bp is a prime target for hate right now b c how popular they are getting and how they ve started to bleed into mainstream music culture  they ve become part of the conversation with other big western artists  it s only natural to hate what is popular  another part of is there is a some jealousy when a group with only 9 songs can get so much in a relatively short time  they think bp didn t have to work as hard to get to where they are so resentment creeps in  that s why these anti s always make predictions like  how they expect to do a world tour with only 9 songs   then it blows their mind when bp sells out their concerts and makes them hate bp even more ,1,696,132
i just want everyone to get along     i love kpop  whenever i see hate thrown in any direction i feel like it does more harm then good  having a favorite group is great  but tearing down another group just because they aren t your favorite doesn t help anyone  i m a huge twice fan  but i can always find multiple songs from different groups artists that i enjoy  bp b side tracks are my shit   i really wish there wasn t as much hate in this community as there is  that s why i tend to stay away from  and focus more on the individual groups subreddits  ,1,555,102
go into  bp threads and sort by controversial  meaning an almost equal number of downvotes to upvotes   you ll find super positive and ordinary comments like   so happy for the girls  big things coming their way  on the very top of the controversial queue  ,1,257,43
i agree  if there s a good song i ll like it  but to me it feels like some people bandwagoned itzy just because they dislike bp,1,127,25
i think people just dislike yg so much that any post about bp reminds them of their hate for yg  which sparks downvotes    ,1,123,24
it simply because bp s growth outmatches that of anyone else other than bts  kpop fans get extremely invested into their favorites so any other group doing noticeably better is a threat  it is a really childish pov  but it is how it is  in the grand scheme of things it doesn t matter  success simply attracts haters  that will never change  ,1,342,60
i have no hate for them  i m not a fan of the song but i don t hop into every itzy thread to downvote every positive comment the way those people do to bp  if they come out with a song i like  i ll enjoy it  i can appreciate the fact they tied izone for debut to win  beating bp   and i feel for the lee sisters receiving hate for their looks  but it is a pretty easy correlation to see the itzy love and bp hate ,1,413,86
bts and bp are like the most hated groups on ,1,45,10
i haven t seen this hate  i ve seen yg get hate  but not bp  when bp has new music it will get upvoted a ton as usual  plenty of fans there  ,1,141,30
i ve never looked there  heard too many toxic things  i go direct to the reddit subs for each group  exid  twice  redvelvet  apink  and mamamo    and of blackpink  ,1,164,28
you re so correct  i saw so many itzy posts in my timeline i almost unsubbed ,1,77,15
buy ahead of time  for sure  it s usually the first item to go  i got to the merch table with 3 hours to spare and it was already sold out ,1,139,30
the joke s on them  bp stays un bothered and keep on rising  ,1,61,11
lisa racist maybe  ,1,19,3
r kpop has become  you need only see that everything itzy is posted here  with people constantly slobbering all over everything they do  these people think that only 1 company and or 1 group is good and all else is bad  they are promoting the hell out of itzy calling them the jyp version of bp  so in their mindset  they need to take down 1 group so that the other might prevail  go back 6 months and look for post about somi while she was still with jype and you will see people here love her  have a peak into the somi post today about her debut and you will now see hate directed at her singing and dancing talent  at teddy  at sunmi  another that left jyp   at blackpink  at yg  and everything else these jype fanboys and fangirls perceive as a threat to jype dominance  they ve become as insufferable as the childish members of the bts army  a small  vocal subsection makes the whole look bad  i think most bp fans gave up here in  and stick to the same posts under  so the ratio is even worse now ,1,1004,191
i haven t seen the hate myself  but i wouldn t be surprised  success brings out haters in everything  blackpink included  with blackpink gaining traction in the u s   their popularity is rising  bringing forth many eyes on the group  both good and bad  it just so happens that the  bad  ones are the loudest and will voice their opinion more than the majority of  good   if you ever ask a hater their reasoning for their distaste  often times their excuse is obviously one with very little backing to it  jennie is lazy  jisoo can t dance  etc    usually the actual reason is jealousy envy and fan warfare that isn t even worth acknowledging  to answer your question from another comment  yes  bts had just as much hate thrown at them when they hit it big in the u s  the best thing to do is just support those you like and ignore those those that are toxic to the community  ,1,876,154
the promoters  live nation  i believe   will post the schedule maybe a day or two before the concert  ,1,102,18
i have gotten used to it by now lol any news related to blackpink they try to report for it to get removed  ,1,108,23
legit almost every other bp post ,1,33,6
i mean ikon does get hate moreso than bp actually,1,49,9
that sub is very bts centric  and bts fans tend to not like blackpink  the young fans at least    cause blackpink are the only real competition bts has in the western market  and  being a english speaking forum  is full of people who care about the western market and don t want bts to be undermined by a different group  which incidentally  is why i went from liking bts to having a bitter taste in my mouth whenever i read their name  all thanks to the lovely fanbase they have  under any and every comments section of anything related to blackpink s us debut  you will see people saying something along the lines of  these girls are trash but they don t represent k pop  go watch bts and you ll see what good k pop is like  every  single  time ,1,747,135
where did they get hate  can you link any example threads ,1,58,11
i think the thing with ros  is that she doesn t have muscle tone  lisa is obviously thin as well but her legs and arms look more muscular and so looks kind of healthier i guess  in saying that  even though ros  is looking the skinniest she s looked i personally don t think she looks frail or unhealthy ,1,303,56
buy ahead of time  a good number of people will be buying at the venue for sure and you don t want to waste your time lining up  ,1,129,27
i can t say for sure as i really don t pay attention to what the mainstream opinion may be  especially if it s hate  i m getting too old for that sort of venom  i would say it s best to take what i said with a grain of salt and to be a more general observation  this doesn t have to be solely on kpop  but a lot of interest groups  when one thing gets too popular  it gets a more increased hate   amp  x200b  i wouldn t be surprised at all if this happened to bts as well ,1,472,93
i don t pay attention to bts  but did bts get the same pushback and hate if you know ,1,85,18
i feel it s a fairly normal reaction when a group like blackpink get as popular as they do and at least within the context of the usa  more mainstream  feels like it s the common thing to do is pushback once something gets too popular ,1,235,44
jealousy is a disease  get well soon  that community ,1,53,9
this thread compelled me to buy a ga soundcheck ticket on resale  sorry  anti scalpers   on a completely unrelated note  i have an extra ga non soundcheck ticket for la if anyone wants to take it off my hands ,1,209,37

what kind of concept would you guys like to see for their march comeback ,1,73,14
100mil for a choreo vid wtf that s more than most actual mvs get in years lol,1,77,15
tbh i would buy ahead of time to not miss out,1,45,11
im pretty sure there s gonna be merch tables  but the light sticks require batteries so i m guessing it s better that you buy it before  they re available on amazon ,1,165,28
this solo debut really pushed blackpink further up on everyone s list tbh  i know there was the whole uproar amongst  and even in this sub regarding jennie getting a solo  i honestly think the effect that turned people off ended up having the opposite effect  so many of my friends who don t follow kpop tuned into and enjoyed jennie s solo  they didn t even see the mv  just this choreography video and said this was fire  it really brought a different element and color to blackpink as sort of an extension of the group s color  this was definitely the intention for their solos and i ve been an advocate for it  i think the main reason why people were on edge was because of a third party source saying that they d have a nov group comeback  ,1,745,134
same name for their twitter accounts,1,36,6
any update on those dedicated fan cams  like [record211]   for ros  [offthepage_js]   for jisoo [paint it black]   for jennie,1,125,19
no problems  glad i could help others with the concert  and thanks for linking the guide in the resources ,1,106,19
they re having a comeback in late march  not sure when the second one is ,1,73,14
anyone else anxiously awaiting the comeback  im checking this page  facebook  ig  youtube  all multiple times a day just anticipating the release of their new music  ik its not supposed to be until mid late august  but im so hyped   ,1,233,40
oic thanks,1,10,2
our girls can definitely pull off any outfit and look great  i don t think any of their outfits were poor or questionable apart for some unfortunate malfunctions   but i will say that i liked their styling in their debut era more  personally   ,1,244,41
i agree  they should definitely not be clones of each other  but style can be different but cohesive as well  and i don t mean match matchy  in the us promotions i felt like they took their  given  individual style a bit too far  each of them looked great individually  but as a group  the visual vibe was a bit all over the place  imo  elegant k pop award show style outfit for jisoo  jennie was chanel of course  lisa with her signature pants and rose with her street style vibe dresses is all fine   but they were all in very different colour combos and their makeup hair styling was also extremely different  ,1,613,110
i purchased the blink vip package for the chicago tour at 8pm does anyone know exactly when you will be able to enter the venue and see the sound checks  this is to decide whether i should skip school or not to make use of my tickets  ability ,1,243,48
they work for yg ent  as backup dancers  the group names are  crazy  for the girls and  hi tech  for the boys  ,1,111,21
that was the one thing that i thought made them look different than other groups was the fact that they were seen as distinct individuals coming together to make a group not a bunch of clones of each other  i like how the girls have their own style in the group idk why it should be changed  ,1,292,57
although this is a little tangent from your comment  i ve been hearing a lot of complaints of their stylists lately how they re doing a poor job  personally  i don t get it  the girls look great and i ve never seen a questionable outfit on any of them before  with regards to a consistent group image  that makes sense  they had one during their dddd promotions with a black and pink theme that was nice ,1,404,73
definitely  although none of the girls are alarmingly skinny  like skin and bones level   i ve seen some fancam photos where some of the girls looked especially thin where it s noticeable  again  they can be naturally thin  i get that  i was a 5  11  and 120lb guy in hs but i ve gained weight since then ,1,305,55
she s worked so hard  so proud ,1,31,6
i have the blink vip package  do they tell you how early you have to be to see the sound checks  the concerts for me starts are 8pm  i really hope i don t have to be there that early or i would have to skip school,1,213,46
i don t know if it s super common but i ve seen some criticism  or rather concern  that the girls are looking quite skinny  ros  especially  i actually don t disagree at all to be honest  i know they re all naturally thin and performing all the time certainly keeps you in shape  but i d be lying if i said i wasn t slightly concerned about how the company is taking care of themselves them ,1,391,68
i don t know much about them other than their instagram accounts but all of the following are yg dancers and i think have worked with bp   ryeon89  gahee_v  kimsejin__  silvergunnnn  subin_o o_  sssseon_____n  dandany___ and i believe  jiyeonl_ is a stylist    for them but i m not sure her exact role  ,1,303,49
recently i ve felt that the stylists are trying really hard to make each of them look different from another  especially in their us promotions  i m personally not a fan of it  as they are a group  i think there needs to be something that ties them together visually as well  apart from their killer beauty of course      i am really looking forward to how their styling will be this upcoming comeback  i guess i might be hoping for too much here   ,1,449,83
what are some common criticisms  with merit  of bp have you seen that you would like to discuss  what i m talking about for criticism is stuff like things bp can improve on  not stuff like  they have no talent  ,1,211,39

are you interested in one of the tickets or both   i still have both of them at the moment ,1,91,20
you re right i didn t think of it that way  ,1,44,9
sunmi is much older than jennie and her makeup reflects that  she s trying to look more elegant and fierce with that makeup and it s usually her goto makeup look  jennie changes concepts all the time  for concerts she wants to have a youthful and cute look in front of her young fans  she wants to be approachable and relatable  when jennie does endorsements like [hera]   that target a differen t demographics she switches her make up ,1,436,75

[sunmi s makeup]   here is improved eyeliner  a little better eye makeup and she always does interesting lip colors etc  it s never the same for each performance like it is for blackpink    that s all i want some cute looks ,1,224,38
give me an example ,1,19,4
i m not saying cake her face haha   i gave an example of sunmi s makeup  i just wish they would improve on a few things just a little ,1,134,27
check [this]   thread out  talked about it there  ,1,50,8
she s going for the natural and soft look and not look intimidating  she doesn t need to cake her face with makeup she s beautiful  ,1,132,23
wow  military  malaysia making sure the girls are safe  usually security guards face the crowd  but i can forgive them for looking back to see the girls  who wouldn t   haha,1,173,30

source  [ blackpinkofficial]   caption  thank you malaysia  the past two days have been awesome ,1,96,13
i guess yea  i do minimal makeup most of the time too so i guess i just feel like sometimes their performances could use a lil extra something  a good example would be sunmi s makeup  it s natural but always well placed  a lil bit better eyeliner and some cute glitter touch but you re right it could be what jennie likes    but then her photo shoot makeup is always better  i guess because those have different makeup arises  ,1,427,77
a lot of people prefer minimal  myself included  maybe it s what she wanted,1,75,13
i don t know  it seems too minimal for a stage performance like usually the makeup they do for end of year awards shows  i would expect them to do for their concerts as well,1,173,34
i m not seeing what s wrong with it ,1,36,7
middle aged guy here as well  my older  teenaged daughter introduced me to bp  now my younger pre teen daughter and i also fervent blinks  definitely a great way to bond ,1,170,30

not a normal practice at all and i went to many concerts here  adele  coldplay  ed   you name it  all the concerts announced months beforehand  i ve just checked live nation website  nothing regarding australia tour just yet  ,1,226,38
hey  1  how much  2  would you consider selling just one  i definitely understand if you only wanna sell as a pair ,1,115,22
it s sad they aren t coming to new zealand   looks like i m buying tickets to sydney   rip wallet ,1,98,19
how early do you have to be to see their soundtrack ,1,52,11
australian blinks must be really racing with time if the presage starts on feb 27 and it s already feb 25 over there    is this normal practice down under to have such a close window between announcement and ticket sales  ,1,222,39

sent you a message  ,1,20,5
how can people look at this makeup and think yea it s okay for their concert performances  seriously ,1,101,17
its featured on the qudos bank arena website event calendar  it looks pretty legit,1,82,14
this got deleted because there is no official yg announcement yet i assume  this seems to be a legit site though  they wouldn t just make stuff up  probably just a miscommunication so they either posted this too soon  or yg posted their australia dates too late  though in general i would rather be conservative about  sources  other than yg  but this is definitely no bp fanclub knowing things scenario again either  d,1,419,72
but they were apart of live nation  the ticket website yg is using  i don t see anything on live nation about au dates yet  i m just saying that blinks should wait for an official release by official yg website and official live nation website before buying a package off of a 3rd party website known for cheating customers  ,1,325,58
one true foursome  basically supporting all the girls without a bias ,1,69,11
idk  if anything  them selling a travel package with the ticket included makes it more believable  also  the european tour dates were announced by local live nation branches before yg announced them as a whole so it s not exactly unprecedented ,1,244,40
i highly doubt that yg would allow this travel website to release tour info before they do  all tour dates have been released with the in your area poster  also  this website is already selling a travel package with a ticket to the concert  doesn t seem right  ,1,261,47
assuming legit  rosie s going home  3,1,37,6

i don t think this is legit  blackpink official hasn t posted it  neither has yg or the website  ,1,97,17

for me  there was jam on the way there  because of an accident  so i didnt manage to shop before  so what i did was shop after the concert  i also got couple things on promotion as the sellers were trying to sell off their goods  i m not sure how is it on your end  but this was my experience  regardless  you should still come early to get a good sit ,1,352,71

is this real  how come no official blackpink media pages have announced it yet  ,1,80,14
for real  i first saw jisoo during soundcheck without make up on  it was such an overwhelming experience  seeing her in person  the girls are all beautiful  but when you see jisoo in person that s when you  understand  why she s the visual  truly a sight  ,1,256,45

missed out on the na tour this time around  really looking forward to seeing them live at some point  ,1,102,19
without a doubt  ,1,17,3
i actually think that having all the solos out this year is less likely than a 2nd comeback  hopefully everything goes according to plan though and we ll get both  this could be bp s year,1,187,34
i believe he has a plan for their solo s but still pessimistic about that 2nd comeback this year  ,1,98,19
yeah that is what i am saying thinking as well  yg with a real plan this year  maybe that will be enough for people to not circlejerk as hard and at leats somewhat believe in the 2nd comeback this year as well  d,1,212,42
yg did say rosie s solo would come shortly after the ep and it has already been recorded ,1,89,17
so there is some time between australia and the europe leg of the tour  i smell a ros  solo in between   ,1,105,22
capacity for the venues  rod laver arena  16 200 qudos bank  18 200   21 032 with floor seats,1,93,16
ros  s solo might happen in that timeframe  o,1,45,8
wow  so there s some time between their europe tours and the australia tours ,1,77,13
thank you,1,9,2
my wife and i are older blinks as well  she s from thailand and i m half thai  so that was our initial interest in them  but now their fan has become a mutual interest for us and something we can share  loving blackpink has only brought us closer together  ,1,257,48
i looks so wrong  ,1,18,4
yeah bro  i ll join the irrational old man blink club  i saw 4d  something snapped in my brain now im hooked af  i have no friends that like kpop and they roll their eyes whenever i mention it  i dont care  ive consumed every minute of these girls thats on the interwebz  many times  they make me smile and ive laughed with tears  its weird because i havent really had the same for other kpop groups  not in to any boy band music and a few twice songs i like  i do like red velvet too  they are my 2nd kpop indulgence  i like groups like clipping  aphex  old rock and edm so liking bp still feels surreal ,1,605,118
in that case  a weekend would ve been ideal to those that love far away  that really sucks   ,1,93,18
yikes  mine s only 45 min away  a sad day to you  ,1,50,12
the nearest show for me is a couple hours away  and then i d have to travel back and go to school the next day  i don t know i just wish the dates had been on the weekend  ,1,172,37
someone threw this onstage at the encore on kl day 1 concert  rose picked it up and hugged it while they sang the final encore,1,126,25
the concerts are at 8 pm  yes  it s a school week but it takes place 4 hours after school is done  i m actually really thankful ,1,128,25
we were all concerned when she went backstage and didn t appear until almost the end ,1,85,15
language groot     ,1,19,3
this is exactly why i m glad i bought a ticket for my older brother  he s a pretty muscular guy  he also loves blackpink  so when we heard they were coming to newark  he wanted to buy tickets  he was at work though  so he put me in charge of snagging some  i managed to get floor seats with soundcheck after an hour of waiting  later that night  he gave me my late birthday present  it s almost been a year  and it was blackpink s lightstick  ,1,443,84
i m so nervous this is my first concert in america and i managed to get the blink vip package  anyone know what the perks are ,1,126,25
what the hell is going on  you know whats legit  when something is real  you feel it  trust me   seeing bp live   your gonna feel it throughout your body   its loud yet sounds good  feelin the beat awesome  so go ahead and lose your voice  i did for a few days lol  enjoy the revolution ,1,287,51
i got the vip blink package  kinda sad but happy i was able to buy tickets  friend didn t make it  but nevertheless i don t know what the full perks of having it ,1,162,32
i kinda was in a similar boat with bts last year  when i was on holiday in singapore i saw a group of people performing dna on a public stage  and when i got home and listened to more of their stuff  i was hooked  hooked on bts and kpop again after a break since the old snsd where a big thing  2007 2008   at the end of last year  bts announced that they would perform in my country  nl   and i was stoked  can you imagine a 30 yo white guy going alone to a kpop boy band  me neither  i was in serious conflict the days leading up to the start of the ticket sale   do i seriously want to surround myself with screaming teenage girls    but  i wanted to see their great choreography and hear their music live  i was at work  standing by  ready to buy  but unfortunately it was sold out within minutes  but i m not the kinda guy that only likes group  so i also started listening to other groups  blackpink kinda has that bts vibe as well  and fortunately they are girls  beautiful and funny  they will also perform in my country this year  and i m stoked that i have bought pink vip tickets  so i will get to see them up close  omg ,1,1132,220
a family friend went to a beatles concert in the states when they toured here  however  she didn t actually  hear  the beatles because everyone screamed the entire concert  i m sure you  amp  the other blinks will be let blackpink be heard lol,1,243,42

theres nothing wrong with your age and interests    you like what you like  i never gave two shits about any celebrity until i discovered k pop and blackpink  i cried my eyes out and screamed to the top of my lungs when i seen bts  i know i will do the same thing at this bp concert  the girls are such an inspiration to me and although im the same age as them  i still look up to them ,1,386,78
speaking of tears  i remember commuting to school one day on a bus and bp s aiiyl came on and i legit teared up at the chorus  i didn t know why it happened  as a 20 year old guy at the time  it was so random but i was really happy at that moment ,1,247,53
nah it s cool  if it s true  i guess i m going to a second show  d,1,66,15
to be honest  i wasn t extremely excited to see the concert but i still love bp  the concert was so amazing and i was on the standing area and got to see them so close  now  i m suffering from severe pcd  and can t sleep at night lmao  ,1,236,47
agreed  anyone who was originally invested im 2ne1 or snsd is probably gonna be in their late 20s early 30s now,1,111,21
glad im old enough to afford to buy a vip pass for myself ,1,58,13
34 over here  ive been into kpop a long time and would not miss an oppprtunity like this for anything  ,1,103,20
someone translated an article somewhere on twitter so it s out there somewhere  i can dig up the tweet for you if you d like  ,1,126,23
love this thread  probably the most interactive post in this subreddit that i ve seen in a while  dope af to see people of all kinds of backgrounds and ages to be into blackpink  i thought there d just be a specific demographic over here  wholesome as hell  ,1,258,46
on second thought  i think i ll just wait for a few more hours to keep the surprise for myself  ,1,96,20
[confirmed]   to be coming back in march  get ready ,1,52,9
i see  oh my god     just based on her reading habit makes her my bias now    i am also a person who can t get rid of books     gt  lt ,1,135,28
haha yea she s probably read a lot more  these are just the ones fans have spotted in vlives and airport videos of her holding ,1,127,24
i really hope i can see jisoo at 100 year old being a pretty grandma,1,68,15
wow  i never know that jisoo read so many books  i am greatly impressed ,1,72,14
jisso may need a rest,1,21,5
i warned my wife i might come home from the concert a light up pink squeeky hammer  she didn t get it ,1,102,21
the band i was most into before blackpink was die antwoord ,1,59,11
rose doesn t need her beauty sleep  she s got enough to spare  lt 3,1,67,12
when jisoo is a 100 year old grandma  she s still going to be dabbing,1,69,13
doesn t matter if you re a middle aged white guy  we re all asian teenage girls when bp comes into town  ,1,105,18
yea  i can t wait to watch her on the next season of legion ,1,60,13
lauren tsai turned her stint on terrace house into a pretty nice career ,1,72,13
anyone know the movie she s watching ,1,37,6
music without borders    actually this also explains bp s music is good in quality  although i agree more originality from the members has to be introduced  the beatles  haha  should be one of their greatest role models ,1,220,37
wow  that s awesome  thanks,1,27,4
oooh terrace house  i remember scrolling through netflix and seeing this super pretty eurasian girl on the cover for this terrace house show and decided to give it a shot to see more of her  this was aloha state and i ended up having a huge crush on lauren tsai  the eurasian girl  haha  reality tv shows are super not my thing  especially one in a completely different language  but i actually really enjoyed it  ,1,414,75
start time according to ticket was also 6pm  concert maybe started 5 10mins later  ,1,83,13
yeah idol life is very hard and sometimes lonely  they pretty much have no personal life and have to monitor themselves in everything they do as to not harm the group  despite all that they always have a smile on their face and are some of the most warm hearted celebrities i ve seen  i ve followed them extensively and they have no mean bone in their body and seem very genuine in their actions  i m sure behind the scenes they do face problems in life just like the rest of us since they re human  if they do  they seem to approach it maturely and try to make sure not to let their fans worry about them  ,1,607,115
 gt it involves a bunch of things that sincerely is hard to understand if you`re not an sound engineer  which you don t seem to be  or aren t a very good one given your wild estimates on how long it takes to do something  where are you coming up with your estimates  these are not accurate at all  it s completely normal for producers to have   for example week long song writing sessions these days where they ll complete 5  tracks entirely  someone like teddy has definitely pumped out enough material to believe he can do that as well  besides that  since bp aren t involved in any production  they literally only need to be there for vocal recording  which absolutely can be  and general is done in less than a day  on album projects  some producers will even take a day per girl and record an entire album worth of vocals per member   don t know if yg works that way  but you still get the point how fast it can be done  i can see someone spending a week on a song if they re that much of a perfectionist  but you re off your rocker if you think it takes a month per song ,1,1077,199
i will probably get a tear in my eye when the appear on stage in la  i m pre blaming it on manopause    ,1,104,22
my journey to blackpink was very odd  my son got me started watching terrace house which turned me onto j dramas  after running out of j dramas on netflix i tried a k drama and was hooked  i think i was looking at some k drama site when i saw something about cl and ended up watching her  hello b\ tches  video and it blew my mind  from cl i discovered 2ne1 and while watching their m vs on youtube  i saw blackpink ddu du ddu du pop up and that was it  i was fully and truly hooked  i know that in this era of fake news  you can t really trust everything you see  but it seems like blackpink are the nicest and sweetest girls you could ever meet  they really seem like they love each other and their fans  and it makes you only want the best for all of them  i m sure i m not the only person here that worries about whether they are living good lives and enjoying themselves  i would hate to find out that yg was abusing them or stealing their money or something else  i know they life of an idol his not  normal   but i truly hope for all four of them that it is worth it   mushy mode off  ,1,1092,210
yea  i don t really look for content from celebrities unless it s the subject matter is something i m interested in  if that s understandable  but definitely hypnotized by bp songs lol i really can t make sense of it but i m enjoying it ,1,237,40
i actually heard them first  i was curious about the rapping because i thought it sounded good as i grew up mainly with rapping  then i looked them up  thought they were pretty but was more curious if they had more songs  so for me it was the music first  and i had no previous k pop interest at all ,1,300,59
time to dig deep on this crazy conspiracy    or just enjoy the ride lol,1,71,14
nearly 50  of seats on tm now are resales at 5x\ 10x original price  so you can see how many tickets was snatched to make money  instead of true fans going   this is just disgusting    ,1,185,33
i first heard them soon after their debut  i have a bunch of cousins that listen to kpop and i heard bp through them  i would say i got entrapped around september 2016  also  it is interesting to note that despite their lack of musical activities  they continue to have more subscribers and views  it s almost anomalous ,1,320,57
they started at 6 but what was the start time according to the ticket  4 or 5  just curious for the canada show,1,111,23
when did you get into bp  i first got into them during the aiiyl era  then had to endure a 1 year drought with no new bp music ughh  i m glad square up was a massive success b c i was super worried the long break could ve sunk them as a group  there s just something with these girls that with all the obstacles they face  they just keep getting bigger and bigger ,1,364,70
she says so much without saying a single word  ,1,47,9
this observation has always fascinated me cuz this is me as well  before bp  i listened to mostly rock and metal  and for your last point  i remember hearing whistle first  i didnt know how many members there were or how they looked but when i searched up their song  i was pleasantly surprised by their visuals  and when i found out they were all total sweethearts  i knew i was fan for life ,1,393,74
it s already been [confirmed]   there s a comeback mid to late march ,1,69,11
yg already confirmed they re having a comeback with an ep mid to late march  why you do think they re including the ep for the na tour ,1,135,26
only bp can make dabbing a trend again ,1,39,8
lol yeah it s kind of weird  i see ppl on here into heavy metal and rock and their taste in music changed when they got into blackpink  i guess i kind of understand the girls are pretty looking which is the first hook but then you get to know them and love their music which turns you into a life long fan ,1,306,62
u right anything with jisoo is ,1,31,6
its okay  i didnt get a ticket either    bills to pay right when they announced the tour  haha  but i really hope they come back too  i need to be in the same building as them at least once in my life ,1,201,43
there would be more  i think it would be similar to ikon s ikon on  ,1,68,13
it s okay tho  i just fooled myself and thought if blinks here as well hahaha,1,77,15
makes sense  i ll wait next week then   or the next week   or the next week   or the next  ,1,91,18
[wrote a guide if you re going to a concert for the first time  or not from the area ]   if there s anything missing or wrong in the guide  let me know and i ll fix it  ,1,169,34
i have an extra vip ticket for sale  ,1,37,8
i feel you  i like bruno mars  ariana  eminem  but i could care less about meeting them  shelling out hundreds to see them live  or watching them in reality or variety shows,1,173,32
girls wanna have some fun we go dumb dumb dumb,1,46,10
yo 30yo  blink gang pushing our way to the front on the floor  ,1,63,13
yeah someone pointed that out  so i ll remove this ,1,51,9
i think they re coming from the lens    ,1,40,7
would be pretty rad  sounds like a good idea,1,44,9
this is so wholesome and genuinely brightened my day  it s amazing how similar we all feel and how demographics don t separate us  whether you re a middle aged male  or a 25yr white female  me   we love our girls  i ve never been more excited to see a group perform  i m surely going to cry when they come to chicago  ,1,318,58
i don\`t know what the girls said i know what the original poster is implying and i\`m explaining to him that songs are not recorded that quickly  aside that let\`s go point by point of what you said 1  what the girls say should not be taken 100  at face value because they don\`t have control over anything that goes in the company if yg decides that will not be released it will not be released let me give you an example  red velvet     look   was actually a song meant for f x  in 2015  it was already recorded  but for whatever reason sm scrapped it and released it 3 years later in a different group what i want to illustrate here is songs are not certain till you see a teaser of it regardless of the company  i can provide other examples if you want but i want to maintain this short  2  the problem is not where you went but how many times you did so constant time shifts takes a toll on your body because your mind doesn\`t know what the fuck is happening your mind uses day and night cycles so it can process sort out and store information that it needs if you keep fucking with your day and night cycle over and over again your brain just enters in panic mode and becomes completely lethargic and becomes easier the catch some kind of disease injure yourself or just flat out faint  3  songs are actually really hard to record i\`ve never heard of anyone who have recorded a whole song in hours it normally takes 1 to 2 weeks to complete it  takes a lot of time to find the right emotion clear mumblings proper enunciation fixing lyrics that are not fitting in the beat or in the melody  of the singing line  creating the singing line in the first place sorting out who sings what part eliminating voice strains cracks decorating the lyrics and more  post production comes after those 1 or 2 weeks and it involves a bunch of things that sincerely is hard to understand if you\`re not an sound engineer  4  mvs in kpop apparently are made over night so in that you\`re right   5  choreography has to be changed too for a myriad of reasons ranging from being too hardcore to do and sing at the same time or the performers not being able to execute it properly not fitting with the beat or with the lyrics or the company just being asshats and wanting it to change for whatever reason that all takes time after you\`ve done that  probably 2 weeks if everything is magically going smooth   you still have to learn the choreography and your memory needs time to absorb shit like that  at least two more weeks doing it everyday ,1,2534,429
blessed image,1,13,2
or maybe take a nice stretch of time to decompress and relax  these girls have been working non stop  it s not healthy  and it s a sure fire way to kill the goose that laid the golden egg ,1,188,36
not sure if there would be any room left  i think the only visible denim is trim and seams  it s got lots of big patches for iron maiden  lamb of god  exodus  slayer  etc  i like blackpink a lot  i d want to give them a bigger patch and better spot than like the bottom seam  maybe i ll just get a new vest and cover it in kpop patches  that s a neat idea  ,1,357,72
put a blackpink patch on your battle jacket  now that s an idea,1,63,12
i m in the same boat as you both   except i didn t get a ticket     its ok though cuz i really doubt that this will be the last time they come here ,1,148,31
i like how it looks like she just got back from dinner and just flopped back on her bed with her shoulder bag still on   ,1,121,26
why does her cheeks look softer than the sheets,1,47,9
i used to think it was weird for me  asian female  30  to be obsessed and invested in 4 girls much younger than me  but seeing kpop grow and how diverse the fans are has erased that thought  now i think it s kind of cute that  older  people  30   with established careers have such a vested interest in the girls as well   ,1,323,63
yeah  i saw people in this week s behind the scene s video talking about him going on break then  i don t know if they ever tell what episode s they re going to rerun though usually  ,1,183,33
i wasn t sure what to think lol but i loved the first episode and i hope there s at least a couple more ,1,104,22
it s alright  a lot of the kpop fandom in the us are made up of middle age folks  male and female  we just wished we have idols like this when we were younger  lol,1,163,34
i guess i m getting into the middle age  i m honestly not sure lol but i m in my mid 30 s and i love blackpink as well as a handful of other kpop groups  to be fair i have liked kpop since my early 20 s but i didn t think i d still be around  it s one thing i ve learned is there s plenty of older fans around  so don t be shy ,1,327,67
and i thought i was the only one getting hooked on bp reaction vids  j k,1,72,15
i m a 42 year old white dude  and when i first discovered blackpink i became obsessed  binged blackpink house on youtube  looked at every interview and appearance i could find  these girls are just super sweet and wholesome  and i m happy to see them work so hard and achieve success ,1,284,50
nice to meet you  if you are going to be on the floor in la  we should meet up  i can t see any reason why two guys working together can t muscle our way past the 14 year olds to make it to the front row       by the way  i m just kidding  ,1,240,52
i know what you mean about watching content  i ve rewatched reaction videos multiple times  i never even knew reaction videos were a thing before blackpink  honestly  i think yg has some evil r amp d lab in the basement and are injecting their diabolical sonic invention into blackpink s songs  i can t think of any other reason for me to be as hooked on their music as i am ,1,375,66
man  i get you  i ve never cared about celebrities or anything  have music i like but never once really cared of i saw anyone live or anything  accidentally discovered blackpink back in december i think and now i m going to my first concert when they do their north america tour  and the amount of content i ve watched of them  never once have i watched about anyone else  it s insane ,1,385,69
i m really strongly considering wearing my denim vest covered in metal patches to the blackpink concert and walking up to people and asking when slayer comes on ,1,161,27
i just want to lie next to her so badly they re her in the eyes and say     beep beep lettuce ,1,94,20
we stan a king who dgaf about what people think of him ,1,55,12
haha i feel you  i ve been a metal head most of my life but there s a few kpop groups that just click with me  never thought i d feel like a teenage fangirl over any groups   i m also a guy  it s a very different vibe between concerts  i ve seen my favourite metal bands but it s a different kind of excitement with kpop  was really weird at first but i ve fully embraced it  ,1,376,71
cursed image   ,1,15,2
i would image they ll do something for the come back but the impression i got was that the diaries would cover the entire world tour not just the the asia stint  i may be wrong though ,1,184,36
just embrace it  love what you love and love it as much as you want  you do you  ,1,81,19
im also a middle aged white guy blink  high five new friend     sometimes i wonder if my overwhelming love for blackpink is weird for someone like me  then i remember how amazing they are and forget to care   ,1,209,40
jennie and ros  confirmed on gma that they have been working on it already  they may not come back in march but they also aren t trying to record it all in 5 weeks  i don t always trust what yg says but have to reason to doubt those 2  while i image they are tired from all the traveling i would be suprised if they are suffering from jet lag from flying within asia  it would definitely have effected them going to america and back as it is caused by the change in timezone not the traveling itself  it also wouldn t take the them 2 weeks to record a song as they would be only recording vocals  they aren t involved in any other process as far as i m aware  it would take them a couple of hours at most  the rest would be left the producers  that would leave them to learn the choreography while the songs are being mixed and mastered  the 5 weeks would give them time to promote and have a short break in an ideal world ,1,923,179
this will be my first also  super excited,1,41,8
i have 3 extra tickets sec 209  row 14  seats 11 13 message me if interested,1,76,15
honestly good for you  you have something you like and can be excited about  plus  everyone s got a hobby where they re in the minority for age gender  reddit is the perfect place to embrace that i think ,1,204,36
she s been dabbing at every concert tour now  ,1,46,9
perfect scenario is rose premiering the song at an australian tour date  like how solo was premiered in the first seoul concert   so that s probably june july,1,158,26
you cannot record a album  or mini album  in five weeks a song recording in average takes 2 weeks  or 1 week if the singers are extremely experienced like michael jackson level of experience bp is not one of those  takes a month to do the post production at least  and k pop has choreography and choreography takes time to learn even the baby level choreography that bp does it\`s still at least 2 weeks to learn it and memorize it  they have to take time to breath they\`re traveling a lot and jet leg is not a funny thing k pop fans are spoiled with frequent comebacks but it ain\`t that fast or easy these people have god like time management  a thing that yg does not know   bp will not comeback before june  ,1,713,115
the final episode will be their preparation for the comeback  i spoke it into existence and i shall harvest,1,107,19
this is adorable  even though i m just a 20 years old girl and if i ever see the girls i will probably pass out  so i feel you ,1,127,28
you are now what youngs one called woke  congratulations and welcome to the revolution  ,1,88,14
same lmao  i got sucked into this kpop culture hard ,1,52,10
the band and singers work with the audio engineers to make sure all the instruments and mics have the correct settings for reach song  ,1,135,24
listening to ros  speaking before bed is just like listening to nightingale chirping in the woods at night  makes me feel so relaxed  ,1,134,23
dddd took 5 days to film so i don t think their mv will be filmed overnight  their songs are probably finished  maybe they are practicing the choreography right now ,1,165,29
have fun  set list was same as the other concerts  but i m afraid i ll spoil other blinks who haven t attended by posting  if you still want to know i can send you via pm   ,1,173,35
my seat still wasn t great for photos but [here s four of them walking off after the encore]     ,1,97,18
me too  never felt so excited before for a music group haha,1,59,12
if this happens it s going to be my first comeback as a new blink lol i m hyped,1,79,17
hell yeah,1,9,2
selling vip ticket  message me ,1,31,5
they might be trying to stretch it out because of the 5 week gap between the asian and american stints of the tour,1,114,23
selling a vip ticket   message me ,1,34,6
i thought it was interesting that the pushed somi s debut from march to may  so i think we are 100  getting this ep that yg spoke about  i know that somi is black label  still yg though  but i don t think they would put her debut out when blackpink are coming back  yg wouldn t be able to give somi the attention she deserves  so i think we can for sure look forward to new music  super exited for both ,1,403,79
is anyone else disappointed with the dates for the tour  the shows are in the middle of the week  and as soon as my parents heard that it was a big  no   i would think they d consider how a lot of their fans are young adults still in school  ,1,242,49
ahh okay i see  thanks ,1,23,5
not that i am aware of  he said it will come after the bp comeback and he wants to have all three solos out this year   one more bp comeback after the supposed one in march ,1,173,37
but didn t yg say her solo was coming before coachella ,1,55,10
i assumed so as well  but maybe it ll be released tomorrow   ,1,61,12
 gt  and ros  solo there is no way they will release a blackpink ep and the ros  solo at the same time  doesn t make any sense  either they will release that during the tour in which case she wont be able to promote it  unlikely  or after the tour is done ,1,256,51
it will be nice to have some new material for the concerts  i hope they can come close to matching square up for quality  that was an amazing ep ,1,145,29
such nice picture  i m can t wait to see their solo stages   ,1,61,11
he did,1,6,2
we re supposed to be getting a new ep around that time  aren t we and ros  solo  should be enough time to promote the title track with an m v  ros  sent someone from their team a postcard from russia so maybe her solo m v been filmed already  ,1,243,46
i assumed they were going to use that time to promote their new ep   it should be coming out early in that 5 week break  i would imagine that the ep is already done  or at least the only work left to do on it is the production stuff and doesn t require blackpink s involvement  ,1,278,55
i m going to tomorrow s concert  mind sharing what the set list was like  ,1,74,13
didn t yg say in his statement that the songs were finished ,1,60,11
well it s common for k pop artists film their mv overnight but i don t know about finishing songs  ,1,99,17
queen     ,1,10,2
my day is complete  thank you queen  always provides  ,1,54,9
she s so precious ,1,18,3
the kl concert today was about 1 hour 40 minutes  began about 6 10 to 7 50  but we enter about 5pm  which was about the time i went it  and i know that there are people already there buying merch and whatever as well  so if you plan to go  i say you would probably want to make space for about 3 5 hours  depending on how much shopping you planning to do  enjoy ,1,362,72
fuckkkkk i wanna lie next to her,1,32,7
what a beaut,1,12,3
mine hasn t arrived    thank you for letting me know what to expect  such lovely box ,1,85,15

please share pictures    ,1,25,4
the paris concert iirc has a three hour schedule  so maybe that s the thing in eu concerts  that may be because of new songs  in my experience  the concert i went to lasted close to 2hours  around 1hr and 45mins ,1,212,40
singapore s concert was from 7 30pm to 9 30pm  after an encore and a very spontaneous happy birthday to ros   people who went for the soundcheck party were randomly drawn from the cat 1 ticket holders one day before  so we didn t have a  soundcheck package per se  i ll just let you know my timeline  i got drawn for the soundcheck   however  depending on the concert promoter  this will differ  soundcheck registration will start at 2pm  but i reached the venue at 12 because there was an unofficial queue  after registration  you ll receive a soundcheck wristband and head to the security check at about 2 30 and then the holding area  you ll probably wait till about 4pm  then the soundcheck will begin   i ll not spoil what happens unless you want me to  so after the soundcheck i m not sure if you ll have to rejoin the general queue or soundcheck holders get to stay inside   probably depends on promoter  for singapore we had to head out and rejoin the general queue  then you ll finally be inside  and well  enjoy the show  ,1,1032,177
the site is legit  their stuff is official  albums bought there even count towards the charts ,1,94,16
it depends on the schedule that the promoter of the tour will release  it varies every concert  and i met a lot of blinks  too  we were just talking about the girls while waiting for the concert  everyone was so friendly  i m sure you ll have a blast  ,1,252,47
just came out from the kl concert  started a little past 6pm and ended at 8pm  so approximately 1 hr 45 min to 2 hours  europe and na concert could should be longer with new songs hopefully in march  concert was fire today   ,1,225,43
the 10am registration s for the merch that comes with the package  there s not much to do after that  just waited for 2pm for the queue  but we went inside around 3 30pm  there was a lot of waiting around lol but i didn t stand the whole time  try to sit rest as much as you can lmao ,1,284,55
hahahahaha so how much time before the soundcheck should i be at the venue  what did you do while waiting  are other random blinks talk to each other in the queues  sorry for asking so many questions but thats the first time i attend a concert    thank you so much for answering me    i really appreciate it,1,307,57
10am seems so early if the soundcheck was at 4 30  what did you do during that time  did you have to stand the whole time  i ask because i have soundcheck tickets but standing from 10am until the end of the concert would be the end of me   ,1,240,48
it was lmaaooo i was so tired after  but we had to get there early because there was a registration for the soundcheck  and then the queue number registration  and then the actual queue  ,1,187,34
woah sounds awesome   i got the pink vip for the london concert so i want to be as prepared as possible  was going to the venue 6 hours before the soundcheck worth it  sounds like an overkill for me,1,198,39
yeah  it s the same day  i got the soundcheck package and i had to be there at 10am  the concert starts at 7pm   we were ushered inside the concert venue for the soundcheck  which started around 4 30pm and ended around 4 50pm  after that  we went out again and waited for a bit before going back in for the main concert  ,1,321,60
is the soundcheck at the same day  if it is how many hours before  thanks btw,1,77,16
ros  dining john lennon s imagine,1,33,5

my tickets came in today for la   who s excited    ,1,51,9
nah man lisa s said multiple times that she loves both dressing up and dressing down  just look at what she wears to rehearsals or when she s out alone  she s lisa oppa after all     and i m not about to judge whether a stylist in korea is doing the  bare minimum  from my bedroom  not knowing the extent of bp s involvement in their outfits  our girls aren t dumb if they re global superstars ,1,394,70
damm    i bought mines for  215  lucky  ,1,40,7
the mma outfits were extremely uncomfortable  jennie was trying to keep her shorts from riding up  even lisa was fidgeting from the top they made her wear it was paining her  ,1,175,31
 lisa is a self proclaimed tomboy  pls show me where  that doesn t mean she has to wear cargo pants all the time  ros  suits many different looks and it s being underutilize by putting her in the same tops every time  jisoo would also look good with more experimental styles  the point is they re doing the bare minimum ,1,320,57
never said it was an  excuse  but if you re going to compare outfits then at least do it in a even playing field and don t handpick the nice outfits vs the  bad  ones this is more directed at the person who made that tweet   personally i liked their outfits at mma  yes the wardrobe malfunction for ros  was bad and the outfit s  could ve been better but they weren t as bad as people say imo ,1,393,73
jennie is sponsored by chanel  lisa is a self proclaimed tomboy  rose suits those types of tops  and jisoo shines in those classically pretty dresses  it looks more like they ve found their comfort zone than the styling being bad  sure  this does get repetitive  but i think they re at the point in their careers where they would speak up if something doesn t look right to them  they re big girls and they know what they re doing ,1,431,74
that does not excuse the fact that her concert performance outfits are redundant right now and feels like the bare minimum along with all the wardrobe malfunctions  you re conveniently not including the melon music awards 2018 atrocious outfits  ,1,246,37
look i m not a huge fan of the new stylist but and this is a big but the tweet with pictures in question that you linked seems to be a bit misleading and i ll tell you why  on the upper row you have picture 3  4  5 and 6 from end of the year award shows seoul music awards  sbs gayo daejun  asia artist awards and melon music awards to be correct  on these award shows it s comon for the stylist to dress them up even better  now if you notice  none of the pictures on the bottom row are from what i can tell any end of the year award shows but only from either concerts or promotional events like shopee  if you look at blackpinks 2019 end of the year award outfits they look a lot better and hold up to the outfits shown on the top  like the [golden disc awards 2019 outfits]   or the [sbs gayo deajun 2019 outifts]   for example ,1,832,164

late response  but yes ticketmasters site is godawful  red velvet tickets i had it open on my phone and my browser and neither would allow me to actually buy the tickets  this time with bp i had 3 different browsers open and my phone  i got into the pre que with all 4  when the timer expired 2 of my browsers failed and i lost the pre que  my last remaining browser had me around 400th in q and my phone was around 1800  it took me selecting the package i wanted and trying to buy it like 8 times before finally going through  which sadly is an improvement over the last time  for rv i got kicked out of the q and couldn t buy tickets and it kept saying all the flr seats were sold out  i called their automated line and managed to get cflr tickets  tl dr ticketmasters website and app are completely garbage and unreliable  as ridiculous as it sounds  be ready to try and call them and do it over the phone because you might have a better shot  ,1,947,181
i thought it was only jennie who would pick out stuff  i remember when they were getting a lot of backlash in 2017 as to why jennie had the best  most expensive outfits and stylist said jennie was the only member who would help choose her outfits ,1,247,47
i actually like the way they were styled when square up dropped  the outfits were a little more adventurous than before  although their outfits previously were more cohesive  my personal problems with the styling  ros  wears a lot mini skirts and bralettes  there was one performance of d4 were she wore a trousers and she looked great  her outfits need more variety  even though lisa pulls of the outfits  sometimes it s too much  there was a recent interview with the new stylist said that lisa usually gets the outfits that the other girls can t pull off  jennie and jisoo outfits are the most consistent  although i wish the stylists would make sure the soles of heels that they wear were sanded down  sometimes you can see their about to slip  on whether the girls actually like their outfits  there never actually going to admit it if they don t  they d be labelled as ungrateful and rude especially in korea  and even if they did it would be in a humorous manner on a variety show or something  ,1,1002,176
i m not completely sure  i d contact the venue to confirm just to have a clear answer  ,1,87,16
i said this in a rv concert thread  but ticketmaster axs are literal cancer to all event goers everywhere and they need to be stopped one of these days  scalping tickets  jacking up prices while you are ordering them  scummy garbage practices  ,1,244,40
i had gotten some meme laptop stickers from redbubble com  you can try [these]   maybe,1,86,14
directly from ticketmaster   album bundle info  every ticket purchased online includes 1 digital copy of the blackpink forthcoming ep  one digital ep per ticket  you ll receive instructions via email on how to redeem this album before your concert date  us canadian residents only  offer not valid on resale tickets   so no  the original buyer of the ticket will get the email for the album download and they might be able to forward that email to you if you have a way to contact them  but i definitely would not expect to get it,1,530,92
no i don t think  when buying tickets it says you will receive the ep but not valid for resales ,1,96,19

yeah that would be awesome  thanks ,1,35,6
i would keep an eye out on ebay especially during tours it saves me a shit ton because the shipping from he official merch sites is gnarly  i can link you a seller that i buy from all the time if you want ,1,205,43
i mean i have tickets in hamilton that i bought for a friend who changed her mind so i m reselling  not all resell is a business opportunity,1,140,27
out of curiousity  where did you see they are considering adding more na dates ,1,79,14
no they ll run the whole episode to fill a spot when the show is off for a week ,1,80,18
i don t think so ,1,17,4
have you gotten hit with customs   amp  x200b ,1,46,7
hot topic ,1,10,2
thanks for responding  i didn t think so either  so must be something special  maybe it s for the ratings that happened being the highest rated episode  ,1,153,25
to be totally honest  you have to blame axs and ticketmaster for scalping their own tickets    i looked into axs premium just to see how much the p1  198 50 were going for  apparently axs scalped themselves and said these  premium seats  have amazing view  therefore they re selling it for like  550  on the day of  said it was market price  and each time you inquire about the tickets  the price fluctuates depending on how many people are looking at premium seats  hence    market price     amp  x200b  drives me mad because it s a lot of people s first time buying and they do not know any better  then after buying these premium seats   they see their friends get it for regular price   it hurts  hence the reason why some resale tickets are super high  can t blame some of them  they bought the wrong tickets and trying to get rid of them   amp  x200b ,1,857,146
yes  late night shows in america show reruns during breaks from filming  so  for example  if colbert isnt filming new shows for the first week in march  they ll still show the late show every night that week but they ll all be re runs picked from the last month ish of shows  so colbert is going on break and the bp episode is on of the ones they are showing as a rerun during the break ,1,387,73
i am not going to buy a resell ticket no matter what the price is so i hope they add another show near chicago ,1,111,24

it s much more that 30  i would say 50 to 60  ticketmaster is corrupt,1,69,14
thanks for the recommendations  just order a poster from redbubble,1,66,10

no one is blowing it out of proportion  in fact you are the one so worried about this becoming blown out of proportion  also to some people fashion is important stuff  you see people praising and criticizing celebrity outfits in all the time  ,1,243,43
serious apologies if i was disrespectful to you  i just have very strong feelings about how idols are treated by their fanbases  we ve all seen it go very wrong  my personal opinion is that fandoms go toxic starting with these petty little criticisms that naturally create divisions in the fandom  it s never about the most important stuff  music  performances   they can snowball into full blown rage posts   about their hairstyles etc  ,1,438,71

same  she still looks pretty so idk why people kept on blaming her stylists  what if these are the outfits that she wants to wear ,1,130,25
i ve been a kpop fan since 2008 and trust me i ve seen a lot kpop fans being so devoted to their idol to the point that they re like obsessed     with them in a very alarming way  like they will blame anyone in the company if their favorite isn t getting what the fan wants  they will literally exaggerate everything and make theories and conclusion about whats happening behind camera which is obviously nothing lol  these outfits for me are fine  and as far as i know the girls coordinate with their stylists on what they want to wear  ,1,538,98
i did not talk about dividing into two camps  just wanted peoples thoughts  other people in the thread have articulated their thoughts more clearly and respectfully than you have  ,1,180,29
yes  let s be patient for now  in the event they add more dates  we can buy our tickets then and let those who gambled on reselling tickets be forced to bring down prices to more a acceptable rate  i saw a  1300 seat and  666 seat within a row of each other for p1 lol ridiculous right ,1,286,57
i ve seen this before  it s just my opinion  can we never criticize    this is bullshit of course  you titled your post  we really need to talk about the stylists   this is a loaded statement  it implies a lot of  mostly negative  things  no  we don t  need  to talk about their stylists  i never thought this was an issue until you posted about it  which is my whole point  posts like yours are created to divide fans into two camps   love their look   hate their look  that discussion hurts the girls in the end ,1,514,95
definitely agree with you about the malfunctions it s happened to rose during one of their american tv performances also  ,1,122,19
my only problem is sometimes the outfits look uncomfortable not functional for dancing  for example  lisa s chains breaking during the grammy party or rose s shirt ripping at an award show  also lisa s outfit at that same award show had these like dangling chain things that looked so uncomfortable and distracting while she was dancing  in those examples  i thought the outfits themselves were cute  just not functional for performing  i could give more examples but eh  wardrobe malfunctions will happen regardless and the girls are well trained to deal with them  but i do think more attention could be paid to that aspect of the styling  otherwise  i don t understand all the hate toward the stylists  fashion is about taking risks  not all outfits are going to be a hit  fashion is also highly subjective  people have different tastes  luckily with bp  most outfits are a hit  imo  and let s be honest  they could go out there wearing garbage bags and still look amazing  ,1,977,163
lots of people follow artists even if they dislike a recent project  for example i disliked lana del rey s honeymoon album  but stayed with her and her new album is amazing  feels like you have too much of a problem with difference of opinion and think everything should be roses and rainbows ,1,293,52
i use [kpoptown com]   for my merch  i think their pricing is pretty reasonable for my budget and i ve had nothing but positive experiences with them as a company  i ve never tried using yg but i bought a 2ne1 light stick from kpoptown and it worked out nicely  ,1,262,47
no  because the songs are why they exist  but if they dropped a new ep that was generally well received by the fandom  and one person kept posting about how much that ep sucked  i d ask that person why they were still following the group if they hate everything new they are doing   if this sounds too specific  that s because it is  ,1,334,62
sorry so if for example i hate one of their songs  you ll keep fighting the topic to death instead of acknowledging that point of view or the facts presented  ,1,159,29
i ve also seen this excuse many times  yes  you can talk about these things of course  but i will fight it every single time because i think in the end  these complaints are destructive  and create divisions in the fandom  and in the end that hurts the girls  please don t take it personally  i m not trying to attack you   i ve just been in these  i hate their new look  battles before and i really really hate them    ,1,420,79
this is such a pretty box  the more i see of it the more i want to save up for it  ,1,83,21
do they usually tell what episode they re going to tell when they re on vacation  i watch a couple late night shows but the only one i follow on sns is stephen  i was a bit surprised they told it was this episode  i figured it was because of the big ratings boost it got ,1,271,54
perhaps  we ll see with the next comeback how the style evolves,1,63,11
the ep coming with the tickets is g e n i us  ticket album bundles count as album sales and is gonna put them directly on the charts when it releases  ,1,151,31
see  no one really knows  heck we don t even know if the girls are actually the one who are telling their stylists which they d want to wear  so if the girls are actually the one who s choosing the style  what would we tell them   ayt  change your style  we dont like it  its not what we paid for   and im not saying you re complaining  stan twt is complaining tho  ,1,366,69
maybe they just like a certain style now  if you look at other groups they also wear the same variations of the same styling during their eras because that s the look they re going for       i ve noticed that ros  seems a lot more comfortable with her outfits now since they re a mini skort kind of style where as before her short dresses were cute and different but they would constantly ride up and expose her safety shorts so she would constantly be pulling them down  as for her hair  maybe she s not trying to put heat on it to not further damage it since she s always changing the color  ,1,594,109
of course me too  i love the members individually and the songs  but the packaging and  look  of a group can also be defining for them  snsd for example always had cohesive but personalized outfits,1,197,35
fair enough  personally  i like their songs  their performances  and the members individually so i m all set  i think this bp stylist controversy is just obsessive fans looking into bp a little too much ,1,203,34
sorry but we re allowed to opinions on everything from music to styling choices  it s like saying any discussion will divide the fandom and end badly if you don t blindly support everything about them,1,200,33
a counter argument to what exactly  i think that complaining about their look is disrespectful  and unnecessary   i ve seen the exact same complaints about other idols on their social media sites   it always ends badly   it just divides people and in the end makes the fandom look entitled and petty ,1,300,50
i realize that people in general just want the best for the girls  there is a nice motivation behind all of these complaints  at least partially   i am just not sure how reasonable it oftentimes is  especially when it comes to something which i would argue is really subjective like liking an outfit  if i look at the tweet i would agree that the top examples look better  but i already said why i think that presentation is a little flawed ,1,441,81
that s fine  some fans may be attending more to the looks than others  for me it s about the whole impact of a performance  and sometimes rose or lisa s styling can be distracting ,1,180,32
imo  their styling isn t even that bad compared to non yg groups  the gap between how good  or normal  they are compared to yg groups is significantly larger than that comparing them to other non yg ones  that i think it s fair enough to just gloss over  in other words  i m just grateful they aren t as  flamboyant  as other yg groups than i am to have any complaints comparing them to non yg ones  in fact  i think they ve got more  styles  than say  red velvet ,1,464,83
they all look fine to me  i literally had never thought   what is she wearing   ,1,80,15
fair point  hopefully the next comeback this improves so we ll see ,1,67,11
that tweet is cherry picking  bad  outfits and comparing them to the best before  that isn t a good way to present an argument  there are recent outfits which are excellent as well  just like there were outfits which weren t back then  all of this is highly subjective in the first place  you will like different things than me or 100 other people  i honestly think this stylist topic is one of the dumbest i have seen so far regarding blackpink  no offense  it was part of that cringy petition as well ,1,503,91
i saw somebody on their twitter just yesterday telling them their outfits were ugly  but they loved them anyway  if you want the girls to know what you think about their look  try telling them directly  see how that works out for you ,1,234,43
we are fans of a group subscribed to the subreddit  we all have priorities  engaging in discussion about any aspect of the group is normal as fans  what you said isn t insulting at all  i agree i cannot speak for everyone  but you really have failed to provide a solid counterargument so far to be honest ,1,305,56
 clearly not complimenting them  clearly  this is your personal opinion  don t say it like everyone agrees with you  or that everyone cares  i defer to professional stylists and the girl s own tastes  they always look cool enough for me  and if they did a show that i paid for and i found myself online complaining about their eyeliner or how how their tops were boring or their hair colour i would take a step back and reevaluate my priorities   ,1,447,80
we don t know if the girls have complained about it to yg  but complaining about employees on social media wouldn t make sense  this is just to discuss patterns of choices their styling team has made no one is complaining  it s just observing and sharing constructive criticism ,1,278,46
all i can say is that   if the girls didn t complain  who am i to complain  ,1,76,16
i never mentioned their weight or jennie s dancing drama  this is a discussion about whether the styling is up to par with what they should deserve  and a comparison to the old stylist  it s not the girls job to dictate the styling  otherwise why hire a styling team  no one said they are forcing the girls  but it s clearly not good styling and has no variation,1,362,66
i don t understand at all  they don t owe you a look that you approve of  if they like it  i like it  it s that simple if i thought some evil stylist was forcing them into a look that the girls themselves hated  that would be different  but i find that very hard to believe hey  we should talk about their weight now  and if they  seem tired  ,1,343,66
the part of that was good too  she find jennie hot and has been touching her a lot haha,1,87,19
we can t really reach yg aside from instagram comments  and their stylists have limited comments on their own instagrams  that topic could be a good separate discussion thread ,1,176,28
fans want a good experience  i can understand that  is there like a bbb for kpop where fans can make yg listen to their feedback though  and out of curiosity  what do you think is the reasoning behind people who like one member and vehemently hate another  i mean it s a group  still can t wrap my head around that  ,1,316,59
its not a matter of liking or disliking   more than it is a matter of redundancy in the styling choices ,1,104,19
telling a woman you don t like their hair  clothes and makeup is always a good idea   ,1,86,17
well  it is entertainment that we are consuming  and even if you dont have a connection or devotion to the girls  we do also deserve a good performance  stage show  styling etc  look how many fans are debating whether or not to buy tickets just because we have so few songs  or because the girl s solo performances are always the same    it s about what the fans deserve too ,1,375,68
i m new to kpop  and only follow bp to be honest  i am really fascinated by kpop fans and their  i don t know  devotion  talking about what these girls deserve and what not  no offense intended but the way people treat their kpop idols is fascinating  ,1,252,46
that doesn t match up to the comparison of their earlier era outfits to now  have the girls also lost their creative touch  it extends all the way to the hair styling as well  rosie s hair is always straight now  when before she sported curls often ,1,249,45
y all forgot that the girls are helping curate their own outfits and they chose what to wear  it s not necessarily the stylists fault  ,1,135,23
should we not want the best for them regardless of comparing to other groups  you have to agree that it has been redundant and far from what a powerful look they should be having  ,1,180,34
for a yg group  their styling has been the best by quite a mile  i mean  relatively speaking  there shouldn t be complaints considering what styling other yg groups get ,1,169,29
like others mentioned  there s a bajillion resale seats and it is ticking me off  this was a concert i wanted to go to  but i am edging away from it based on what i saw was available and the prices being asked  being close to a city they are performing at  i can always wait until the day of  if i must ,1,303,62
thanks  i ended up buying from there  ,1,38,7
i got last minute tickets and i m so excited to see them on sunday ,1,67,14
choice music la is a good place to order from  shipping is just high  ktown4u shipping is waaaay too high  however they are reliable ,1,133,24
right  i seriously doubt they add a show on this tour  they ll come back to the us and tour in the future  sure  demand is definitely there  but enough demand to sell out another 17k or whatever  when there s still a couple thousand tickets floating out there  also  adding a show in la  why la  why not chicago or whatever  i just feel everything s been planned and it is what it is  each day that passes without an announcement of actually adding another date  the less likely it becomes  logistics  ,1,502,90
this is my first reaction to blackpink and omg  where have i been  these girls are awesome    new fan ,1,102,19
yup all the merch i ve unboxed are from there ,1,46,9
thanks man  ,1,12,2
concert is tomorrow  much excites ,1,34,5
huh  have they announced concerts for australia yet or have i missed it ,1,72,13
there might be a physical store near you  try searching online  i go to one  though i m in australia  it s a bit kore expensive in store but aye that store bought feeling is worth it imo,1,186,36
ktown4u is where it s at  ,1,26,5
ticketmaster reserve s a small portion of the tickets to do their platinum sale program where they dynamically adjust the price  right now for the la concert there are only [8 pairs of platinum tickets]   left  he makes it out like ticketmaster bought most of the tickets in the arena  ticketmaster does this for every concert with famous acts that are in demand  ,1,364,62
i think the headline is still significant even with the bots and ticketmaster doing their things  first of all  these are signs of high demand for the concert and happen with every popular tickets  but most importanty  let s not forget that this is by far the biggest us tourfor any kpop girl group ever  these are big venues  and i remember people pointing out that bp was in trouble because group like exo couldn t fill 2 3rd of the atlanta venue  to  officially  sell out of almost 100k tickets in 6 dates  even with the ticketmaster shenanigans  is significant and can t be simply handwaved away by bots  a group in little demand would flop all the same ,1,658,116

they do ship to the us  but it is very expensive  it was  27 just for shipping for one shirt for me  the best place to buy official merch is hot topic  they are actually cheaper than yg select and way way less for shipping  they have fewer color options and i think only tshirts  but it s better than spending  60 on one shirt from yg select  another option if you don t like the official merch is things like ebay or redbubble  i can t vouch for the ebay stuff but i have had very good experiences with redbubble when i ve bought stuff from there in the past  if you still want to buy from yg select  use en ygselect com for usd and english  just expect to pay a lot,1,667,128
same  i ended up reselling my old ticket after getting a ga with soundcheck so i m also interested to know other ga blinks  plans ,1,130,24
yeah  we re not doing this bruh  enjoy your show  if you re going  cheers ,1,74,13
but it is sold out  so what if a person wants to sell the ticket for a profit it s their ticket to do what they want  bp already got paid ,1,138,30
i m just pointing out that the headline is false is all and just presenting my own personal relation the data  nothing beyond that  not here for an argument or anything lmao  ticketmaster events resell hobbies being shitty is not new to me   amp  x200b ,1,253,40
and why wouldn t they move  there are ppl who are upset they didn t get tickets and want more dates  sold out means tickets bought and bp got paid doesn t matter what the source is  the prices are jacked b c of demand and ppl wanting to make profit  eventually the price will get lower if they don t move or when it gets closer to the concert start date and get snatched  you make it sound like it s some new revelation and that this doesn t happen to other famous acts in the us  ,1,481,91
and only with 5 or 6 songs    kpop zombies at best,1,50,12
guide for not getting scammed  1  if possible meet in person for the transaction  try to meet in a public place such as a coffee shop  library  police station  2  use paypal only  maybe cash  do not use venmo  applepay  ect  there is no way to get your money back if you use the other apps  3  for paypal  be sure to only send money using  goods and services   do not send money using  friends and family   there is not buyer protection if you send using  friends and family   people might ask for you to send it to them using  f amp f  because it s  faster  or it is  instant   do not  it s likely a scam  4  if you can t meet in person  ask them for a screen record of them opening up the app and showing each of the tickets  there is no reason they should not be able to do this  5  unfortunately  a lot of people who bought tickets bought with the intention of resale  be wary of prices that are below face value  they need to have a solid reason of selling their tickets so quickly after buying them  6  if you believe they are trying to scam you  let other blinks know  screenshots only if you are sure  7  i ve heard this work  but if you do get scammed  you could try adding their relatives or parents and messaging them  obviously you likely needed to have added them on facebook first  if you have other tips  comment them below  they are planning a comeback around late march  so i wish you blinks the best of luck    we re going to see them at coachella ,1,1466,277
you can find it [here]    46 45,1,31,6

that s from their comeback special for aiiyl i believe  it should be on vlive,1,77,14
i plan to closer to the date and see what options there are  ideally i just wanted seated p1 seats on either side and wanted to avoid crazy sasaengs on the floor  definitely bringing ear plugs  kcon has taught me so  ,1,217,41
lol  looking at the forum tickets actually    yea i have like 20 screenshots of stages saved from aviewfrommyseat website  and even reviewed each before yesterday s sale  but i still find it hard to decide ,1,206,35
i agree with you  how come you don t get get floor tickets  though  is there a reason   260 isn t bad  considering they were i believe  198 to begin with  but that was before fees  so   260 sounds as close to  at cost  as you can get  ,1,235,46
as much as i d love for that headline to be the truth  we all know this to be false  a large portion of the venues have been either held off by ticketmaster for their  platinum  dynamic pricing and or taken by scalpers fake fans for some quick profit  just some observations from stricly the la date  since i m interested in going but wasn t able to score tickets  as of right now thursday 8pm  take a look at [all of these seats up for  resale ]   leaving a good 1 4 of the venue empty if these don t move   amp  x200b  ticketmaster had ga floor tix priced at  700 yesterday  today they are  500   amp  x200b  stubhub shows 770 ga floor tix available from  260 and up,1,668,121
there are websites where people have taken pictures of the sections they sat in so you can see what it will look like  just google your section and the venue name  for example  my seats are on the side  sections 126 the forum and i think the view is awesome  seeing as how they will have a catwalk stage as well  ,1,313,61
i mean  you might find some hidden forum posts across the various k news sites but those facebook event pages are the best we re going to get  twitter search is ok but not great ,1,178,33
i find this absurd and ridiculous too  as a result of extreme capitalism    not to mention the somewhat overpriced tickets          sigh,1,136,21
i see  watching live us tv surprised me as there are way too many commercials and advertisements      it s like at least 5 times more than those shown on tv channels in hong kong        ,1,186,33
they  late night shows  take a week off every 3 weeks or so so they ll air a previously shown episode in it s place,1,115,23
if this becomes true  i can finally say blackpink was in my area ,1,65,13
i m not sure of the details whether its on a different timeslot or they don t have a new show that day and plan on re running this episode ,1,139,27
and you know what sucks about this      that some tickets won t sell at all because those resellers want an eye and leg for nosebleed seats  same thing happened at the citi field bts concert  i was there and right in front of me there were 6 empty seats  those seats could have been bought out by true fans  about 20  30  of those tickets are being resold right now    ,1,369,68
what does it mean by re run  isn t colbert taping new episodes every day ,1,73,13
they perform on april 12  amp  19  they have a whole week in between to add another date ,1,89,18

when would it be though  considering their current date is after their first coachella appearance  and then they have their follow up coachella appearance two days later  and then they have their chicago concert five days later  ,1,229,37
wow thats really cool that they are then  ,1,42,8
they are mainly bots maybe  i know there s gonna be many reselling tickets,1,74,13
do they usually re run shows ,1,29,5

i got in queue 30mins before the sale on my computer and then my phone 15 minutes later  the tickets for infinite energy were already sold out when my phone finally got in at 4 30  i did manage to get my p3 ticket on my computer though  i was just still in line on my phone by accident and then my friend said she just got home she wanted a p4  she wasn t able to get one sadly ,1,378,78
i also got some and paid around that much     blinks risk it all   ,1,67,14
an article also states that they re considering adding more dates in na  for the love of god  please show some love for the pacific northwest  i wasn t able to grab la tickets  but i m definitely not gonna miss a portland  seattle  or vancouver show  ,1,251,44

can someone help clarify something  i m trying to buy vip tickets  i see two vip tickets stating the following    ticket  1   row  ga3 vip package  seats  ga1   ticket 2   row  ga2 vip what does ga1  ga2  and ga3 vip mean  please help  thank you ,1,246,43
i have to pay almost 400 to get my screen repaired bc samsung won t fix the front glass without charging for the back  ,1,119,24
yep it s the first one i checked but it s all people selling the resale tickets lol,1,83,16
my understanding  i may be incorrect  is that before the concert starts they let the people with gasc tickets go in and basically see bp prepare for everything  and make sure everything is perfect  then they put us back in line ,1,228,41
gotcha  thanks  basically the sound check is just giving us a chance to see them closer before the concert ,1,107,19
i accidentally bought the ga sc and the face value says 258 50 and the grand total was 297 10  my guess is that  sc  is soundcheck  i m pretty sure the normal price for normal ga was around 198 50  ,1,198,37
ah so no sound check then    did i pay too much for these  ,1,59,14
i wish axs would ve shown the ticket prices in advance  i had been warned that tickets would be expensive based on their european shows but i didn t realize exactly how expensive they were  should ve gotten a screenshot when i had a chance to buy them on the axs site   i got really indecisive when it was my turn based on the prices and ultimately missed buying a ticket there and had to buy one secondhand   ,1,410,76
it wasn t even that  i m pretty sure it sold out within 7 minutes  i was being indecisive on the axs site and ultimately didn t get one on there    i was able to get one 10 min later secondhand but it was  250   i m still in shock the atlanta show sold out tbh but good for the girls  ,1,285,59
the photos of jisoo with the umbrella are so beautiful   ,1,57,10
i wish there s something we can do to contest that none of the ticket prices on ticketmaster were as advertised on the official price flyer  it s messed up that something like  official premium  can exist because they can charge whatever price and whatever fee they want  there s no standardized price  ,1,303,50
 id give her mine ,1,18,4
i love this,1,11,3
anyone know how much the ga sound check tickets at la were  i paid  258 50  ticket not sure if i got the sound check ones or the regular ga tickets since there was a mess of ticket sales on ticketmaster  in the section column it says ga sc  not sure if that was the designation for   soundcheck for la tickets ,1,310,59

idk if i m suppose to be doing this  but i have 2 spare tickets for duluth  ga  i m trying to sell them for  215 flat each since that s how much i paid for them  just trying to break even  i can show the receipt if requested  they re axs premium tickets  still dont know what premium is   its for section 207 row b seats 13 14  my friend also has 4 tickets for fort worth dallas tx  he bought them for  220 each  also axs premium   but it s for section 315 row p seats 13 16  its a p3 area though  only reason why we have spare tickets is because everything kept telling us sold out and we wanted to secure some tickets to have a guaranteed trip  after a while   we were able to secure ga floor tickets  so   now we re stuck with 6 extra tickets  ,1,747,142
i got p2 pricing but axs gave me section 312   so i paid like  100  more for p3 seats   ,1,88,20
what s the differentiation on the ticket to tell if you have a regular p1 ga vs ga sound check ,1,95,18
i was waiting for this  thanks for sharing ,1,43,8
it s just a regular ga ticket  i think  basically for this  it s either ga  standing room floor  with soundcheck or ga  standing room floor   ,1,142,22

it s just make up  those pictures were taken during her solo era  ,1,66,12

we had about the same amount of devices going all with different accounts and we only had two make it in as well  we were going for p1 but got p2  i m happy we got tickets at all  i love seeing the groups live and i m glad they get to come to the us but i have anxiety the whole day before tickets go on sale for any kpop group  it s always so nerve racking  ,1,359,75
yeah that would be dope ,1,24,5

yeah we will   lt 3 i was so sad and disappointed last night when we checked the tickets   ,1,91,18
no problem  if you have any other questions about lining up  maybe give the venue a call  sometimes they have designated lines already set up for big shows ,1,156,28
you are right  p3,1,17,4
awesome  thanks for the help  appreciate it a lot  ^ ^,1,54,10
oh thanks they re  175 each and section 229 row 7 seat 8 11 ,1,60,12
shouldnt section 316 be p3 or p4  the map layout says p2 pricing is only for a few 200s sections ,1,97,20
the ga section is going to be standing room only  for an 8pm show  the earliest you will be allowed in the venue is around 6 30pm  how early you want to get there is up to you  i m assuming they will allow you to line up at least a few hours in advance  i know people have camped out overnight for good ga spots before  but i m not sure what s going to happen this time around ,1,377,76
if both the pretzel and the knish cost more than the hot dog  you ve got to wonder what s in that hot dog  ,1,107,22

good on you for asking  if all else fails try kijiji cl locally or resell on tm  what is p5  from the chart it only goes up to p4  what do your seats look like  curious and how much i might be interested in another pair for friends  nosebleeds are fine ,1,253,50
had to coordinate with my girlfriend in toronto while i was away on vacation   cuba with spotty internet  got stuck on queue number 1 and it never refreshed  after 10 mins says my queue was no longer valid  my girlfriend saves the day and got us 200 seats  far left of the stadium but idgaf i m seeing my ultimate group   ,1,322,61

yeah  are you ,1,14,3
anyone has audio issue with vid ,1,32,6
oh thanks for the info  should ve known,1,39,7
it s just another way for them to make more money  they get money for the initial fee s from first time purchase  then a fee from a resale on their site which si based on the   how much the ticket sells for  and top it all off with the inflated prices for the premium platinum tickets ,1,285,55
they re all gone dude  ,1,23,4
you d think it was the f ing stock market  in the end it wasn t even the price that kept me from buying tickets  but rather axs s payment processing  two different cards were declined with a generic error message  i may reconsider attending any concert in the future that uses them as the ticket seller  thankfully this was my first and hopefully last time doing business with them ,1,382,66
axs premium is like ticketmaster s platinum tickets  they are a reserved block of tickets allocated by these ticketing companies that aren t in the same pool as the general sale tickets  they dynamically price these tickets based on demand in realtime that s why the price constantly changes  having them in your cart doesn t freeze the price  ,1,344,55
interested  pls dm me ,1,22,4

hey all  i was on the tickemaster pre queue and then normal queue and eventually i got to purchasing tickets after waiting like 45 min  for those of you lucky peeps out there who randomly got placed higher on the queue  hopefully you got tix for the price they were advertised for  because by the time i got purchasing tickets  the prices shot up  early sound check tickets went from  253 to  350   the worst part is that as i about to buy 3 tickets so i could sit together with friends  my page automatically refreshed for some reason and i was kicked out of the queue  forcing me to wait even longer to get to the purchase screen  i didn t bother after that  just as i was about to give up hope i literally google searched  blackpink inglewood tickets  and the first site that popped up was vivid seats  without any research i looked up if there were any tix available and i managed to snag 3 ga4 sro tickets at  348 each  after ticket fees   that s way more than i d hoped to spend  but seeing as this is their american debut i went for it  has anyone here had experience with vivid seats  or did the same thing i did and bought bp through there  i ve read some other subreddits and people say vivid seats is legit  but just want to ask some more people  if it truly is legit  i suggest looking for some tix now before they shoot up even more ,1,1346,254
she is so done with her crackhead mom ,1,38,8
pure flames ,1,12,2
damn  i d buy this girl a hotdog ,1,33,7
i m pretty sure it s legal to resell tickets for any price in california  as long as you aren t on venue grounds   amp  x200b  but don t lose hope  just keep checking  some people will get desperate and sell their tickets for a reasonable price   amp  x200b   amp  x200b ,1,271,44
so close yet so far    not too long ago i was at this spot  lol i never get lucky enough to randomly meet any of my lovelies on the street ,1,139,30
short haired jisoo   ,1,21,3
i just don t understand why these websites let you raise the price  even ticketmaster does it on their own resale site  the ticket should be only allowed to sell at face value  it d be the easiest thing to enforce ,1,214,39
so the whole  oops someone beat you to it  is basically because ticketmaster has an incredibly horrible delay when a ticket gets purchased  so when lots of people buy tickets at the same time  ticketmaster gets so lost that it goes  have this ticket    oh that s my bad  it doesn t exist anymore ,1,296,51
[here]   is a video of it  ,1,27,7
i think if you wait and as it gets closer to concert date the prices will drop  should keep an eye out on the listings ,1,119,25
 gt  where should i buy the tickets from  ticketmaster allows ppl to put up their tickets for resale and they re verified so it s the safest option   gt  is stubhub reliable  stubhub is safe they re owned by ebay  they serve as a middleman for resellers  if the tickets end up being fake they will try to get replacements for you or give a refund  sellers will be charged the value of the ticket sold if they sell fake tickets   gt  will tickets ever drop to fsce value  resale tickets will always drop in value the closer the it gets to the concert date  now whether there will be any tickets left that ppl are selling is another matter  getting singles might be easier but 3 seats in a row would be harder  ,1,709,131
awesome  i m still surprised i got a seat where i wanted  i was hoping for 106  107  116 or 117  i couldn t believe it when 116 popped up  the arena looks to be smaller than most  pair that with the way the stage will be set up  we re going to be extra close without even trying    d,1,283,57
117 row b   o so close  ,1,24,6
i did  section 116  row e  did you  ,1,36,8
haha  why does dalgom always look like this around jisoo ,1,57,10
i m going solo  no pun intended  flying in from phx on the 16th  also not korean lol  25  ,1,90,18
wow  lisa can take a picture even in the dirtiest of the dirtiest of places and it ll come out looking all aesthetically pleasing and flawless  ,1,144,25
 come out of bathroom 1 5 hrs later ,1,36,7
love the aesthetic  the setting and lighting are on point  and ofc she looks so dope here  ,1,91,17
hello there  ,1,13,2

wow you re so fast  ,1,20,4
wow legs of the century  every girls  dream,1,43,8
same boat  waited in the queue for ever just to see everything marked up already ,1,81,15
pardon  it was [during the launch]   i ll keep an eye out if someone was able to take a video of it  ,1,101,21
400  for p4        ,1,19,4
literally just sat in that same seat a few months ago  wow ,1,59,12
if the seller says yg entertainment it s should be legit ,1,57,10
we sadly cannot go now  no tickets left  and all the ones are the worst seats going for reseller 400  price  not paying 800   to scalpers  although it breaks my heart    i was so excited to see them   ,1,201,38
i m not in la but i am in dfw  i went to the red velvet show and arrived 1 hour before doors opened  i didn t really want merch cause i m fine with just the ticket but if you do want some i highly recommend showing up 2 3 hours before hand bevause they sold out faster than any other concert i ve been to before  red velvets show lasted from about 7 915 ish so i would say blank pink would also be for around 2 hours give or take  traffic is gonna be horrid afterwards i wasn t able to move for about 45 minutes   1 hour i can imagine it ll be worse in la  ,1,557,113
that s not a yg thing but live nation ticket master which is responsible for bp s tour  they do this with other concerts too ,1,125,22
i knowwww  i was already on the ticketmaster purchasing page 2 hours before 4pm watching the countdown  i was in queue for an hour and then when it was my turn  every fucking ticket was verified reseller or platinum reseller  i gave up ,1,236,43
this was as just as bad trying to get tix for san diego comic con lol ,1,70,16
yeah  for me i kind of didn t care about the price point  i had 5 devices myself in queue and asked 5 people to help me buy tickets and only one of them made it through  2019 seems to be the year that everyone is rolling through na as a solo act  as someone who has been listening to kpop since 1999  the thought of my favorites groups coming to the us  especially solo  was unheard of until the past couple of years  who knows when they will be back  if ever  so that s pretty much always my mentality when i m trying to buy tickets  especially to much more well known groups ,1,577,112

if anyone is around my age range  hmu  im 17 and going alone because none of my friends like kpop   ,1,100,21

update  just made a discord   i ll set it up better later  after i study for an exam tonight  ugh  but feel free to join    if you ve never used discord before just download the app  it ll make life super easy ,1,210,39
i mean money wise lol,1,21,5
same boat for me  i m beyond glad that i have tickets but so so bummed about the price ,1,87,18
so i got ga tickets for the concert and i have a few questions  since it ll be my first concert  is it true that there isn t really an assigned seating  also how early should i arrive to the concert ,1,199,39
what do you mean  the queue you were placed in was pretty much random  you wouldn t have had a better chance now matter how early you were ,1,139,27
buys the new s10 bc lisa is on it,1,33,9
can we have a meetup party for non concertgoers lmao forreal contemplating finding a venue to host a blackpink night for ppl who couldn t buy tix tbh,1,149,25
sad i got a p3 seat    if tickets were next week instead today  i couldve bought one of the better seats  at least i get to see them i guess ,1,141,31
they mentioned it in like the first episode of bp house    are we sponsored by samsung   haha,1,93,18
no problem  i got vip for atlanta  its going to be amazing,1,58,12
lisa is not actually in [the ad that aired]   where in the source is the above image   amp  x200b ,1,98,18
standing is fun  unless you re old or short lol ,1,48,9
thanks for letting me know  i ll keep an eye out for any announcements regarding the time ,1,90,16
i went to red velvet in toronto and honestly  i don t think blackpink can top it for me  wendy being in her hometown was just that special  i love both groups equally but yesterday just felt way too special,1,206,39
a heads up aboout soundcheck that i didnt know until recently    its usually much earlier than the actual concert  not just right before  i saw somewhere about some soundchecks being around 2pm,1,193,32
thanks  good to hear  congrats on getting a ticket  see you there   ,1,68,13
looking for carpool from sauga  ,1,32,5
ga sc stands for ga sound check  for example i got ga only so my ticket only says ga,1,84,18
skinny legend lalisa,1,20,3
isn t that the point of a boycott though  to make a statement  to be noticed  not only would the it be noticed by them  but by the scalpers as well  maybe if they have to perform in an empty theater  they ll actually look into why it happened  and i in no way blame blackpink for this  maybe yg and definitely ticket master and human greed  it s all hypothetical anyway  people are gonna buy scalped tickets no matter what  ,1,424,78
it s pretty much known and been reported that ticketmasters actually colludes with resellers to bulk purchase tickets and resell at higher prices on tm s site  they re practically a legalized scam  there are lawsuits pending  but i don t know much more than that  ,1,264,41
oooo same here i was calling  but was on hold too long  and decided to try again tmr  i ll definitely call them tmr now seeing that they put in a ticket for you  thanksss    ,1,174,35
yg is also to blame  as most of you noticed  there was a thing called official platinum seats  these are tickets that are  set aside for fans by   artists and event providers     so either yg or the event planners that work for yg specifically opted to hold tickets from circulation for the sole purpose of price gouging based on demand  this is why  when seats seemed to have sold out only to later come back as  official platinum   that the prices we re exorbitantly higher than original  i  personally  think this is bullshit and the fact that yg opted to do this is a slap to fans  faces   ,1,594,107
i was watching this and when they showed it  i was thinking the scene with rosie at the beginning was kind of familiar  then it changed to lisa and it zoomed in and i was like  wtf lmao  the girls are starting to pop up in places where i don t expect to see them ,1,263,54
just when i was blown away by the price of iphone x and above  damn this one too  but the features are insane though  always a good sign seeing highly worship brands like iphone and samsung using bp mv as an ad ,1,211,42
anyone else got floor tickets  would be dope to meet some new peeps ,1,68,13
yeah the increase in price for the  premium  was completely unexpected and a huge disappointment  i had seats picked and was checking out before i saw the total  i panicked and had like 4 minutes to decide  i spent the money  i m glad i m going and have good seats but also completely in shock at how much the tickets were  i expected to pay  400 total for 2 p1 tickets  according to the seating charts we saw  ouch  definitely going to scrimp for the next few months to recover  ,1,480,89
use search term  blackpink la  on twitter  there are ppl selling them ,1,70,12
looking to trade only for their la concert  have  p1 ga   soundcheck ticket want  regular p1 ga   difference in price  \  60  they only offered physical tickets for ga  so i would prefer to trade locally  bay area  or meet up the day of  dm if you would like to trade  thanks ,1,276,53
my friend hasnt been able to get tickets yet  i m a 24y o male that s gonna be going by myself   this sounds super fun  also first kpop concert ever     especially going alone     only blackpink and sechskies can do this to me haha,1,231,42
same  vip ftw,1,13,3
saw some seats going up for 5 000 dollars and they are all the way in the upper stadium  pure madness ,1,102,20
did you get your ticket  ,1,25,5
i freaked out yesterday when i saw this on the stream xd,1,56,12
same happened to me  i had to clear out my cache for it to stop giving me that message and by then the tickets were gone ,1,121,26
anyone have 2 tickets to sell at around face value for newark ,1,62,12
i tried so hard to get a soundcheck ga ticket to nj but kept missing out on it  so many people already reselling tickets while i was on ticketmaster trying to get regular tickets  there s gotta be a better way ,1,210,39
ticket master was infuriating  they did so much to try to prevent bots and it ended up just slowing actual people down  i wish resellers weren t taking from blinks who want to go and using it for profit  ,1,204,38
i just realized that the vip tickets didn t mention anything about early access to merch  like the shows in asia     do they sell merch at north american shows  because i need to get a lightstick before they arrive at hamilton lol ,1,231,41
had seven devices on an hour early  all trying to get tickets and only two got in before everything sold out  ended up buying two p4 not next to each other for me and my friend but then 15 min later got p2 next to each other which was my first choice  thank goodness my friend didn t panic like i did and kept refreshing  resold the p4 tickets at original price since every blink deserves to go and not destroy their wallets  can t wait  but also this was so stressful would not look forward to doing this again   ,1,514,98
on the app you can choose your search preferences  make sure it doesnt include resell tickets and i think thatll help,1,117,21
i checked recently and theres still a handful of seats available that scalpers havent gotten,1,92,15
i really hate scalpers  because of them i didn t got the tickets that i wanted  i paid 3 tickets completely in the back  we actually can touch the wall behind us  but we are on the side of the stage  now i m looking at resell tickets that are much more expensives than before and they are exactly at the places we wanted to be  ahhhh it s so frustrating ,1,354,68
me and my buddy were both able to get vip  it took us both about 30 minutes of hitting refresh on several different devices  i cannot wait ,1,139,27
i thought it was pretty obvious that i was saying no  i don t think they re doing it  they don t need to  ,1,106,21
your bank account and mine can get drunk together ,1,50,9
are we buy verified resale tickets on ticketmaster do we still get a copy of the digital ep  or does the original buyer get to keep the copy of the digital ep ,1,159,32
i got vip for atlanta  cannot wait ,1,35,7
so is life  the worst is that i was super chill getting seats way back and using oprah binoculars while i eat popcorn  i ll be there in spirit ,1,143,28
damn  i m sorry you didn t get any  if my cousin didn t get lucky i wouldn t have gotten tickets either ,1,104,19
i never denied that nor does your response answer my question  ,1,63,11
anyone have an idea on how the parking works  i purchased a parking pass when getting my ticket but didn t read through it because i was focused on buying my ticket  will i receive an email with more details about parking later  ,1,229,42
it doesn t matter if it s happened to every bp concert  every single huge trending band or singer will have people using bots to bulk buy tickets and resell at 2 3x the price  this is extremely common  it happens with bts  ariana grande  bruno mars  everyone  the country doesn t matter as long as there s a way to easily bulk buy and resell straight away  ,1,357,63
anyone is selling 2 3 tickets ,1,30,5
what s the designation on the ga tickets between sound check and p1  ,1,69,12
ye i didn t even get tickets  when it said do u wanna butter it said someone else got them  such a trash system ,1,112,23
fuck scalpers dude  i joined the pre queue 10 minutes before the sale and my cousin joined after me  she got past the queue 10 minutes in  and i waited 40 minutes before i even got in and by then all the tickets were gone  my cousin spent 20 minutes trying to buy tickets  bought them  re enter the queue and still got back in before me  ticketmaster sucks  ,1,358,68
i m dumb and i paid 313 dollars for the floor when they had available seating closer for 250 but at least i get to go lol,1,121,26
yeah  she won,1,13,3
oof she archived it ,1,20,4
that look on lisa with those heels    such a boss,1,49,10
is there a chance yg could be using bots himself [like ed sheeran s manager]   it s happening for every bp show  no matter the country  ,1,136,24
i managed to score a ga3 ticket  going by myself  anyone have any ideas on when to show up for this  i assume quite early but if anyone had experience that would be helpful  any other floor people feel free to chime in on when you were planning to show up ,1,256,51
yes i second this ,1,18,4
i think it s awesome they can just walk around times square  but surely there were people there who recognized them   ,1,118,20
hey i m not sure where to post this but i ve got 4 p5 hamilton tickets that i originally bought but turns out we have a lot of extra tickets  therefore selling for original price paid  just want my money back  send me a message if any of you are interested,1,256,50
no like  400 for each,1,21,5
hey i m not sure where to post this but i ve got 4 p5 hamilton tickets that i originally bought but turns out we have a lot of extra tickets  therefore selling for original price paid  just want my money back  message me if interested ,1,235,44
i m flying home from korea on the 15th and a friend and i are driving the night of the 16th and leaving right after the concert but if anyone is like me we could all meet up for food before or something ,1,203,42
like p4 nosebleeds  that s rough  but yeah  i didn t even check the upper deck  i was either going to get a p1 or p2 lower bowl or i was gonna wait on re sellers  i guess just keep checking every couple of days  my guess it around early april people will start having conflicts come up or scalpers will get nervous and prices will drop much closer to face  ,1,357,68
unfortunately  this is the world we live in  as much as i don t want to reward them  i also don t want to miss stuff that i really want to see  regarding the meetup  i am not sure if i m travelling solo or not  if i am  i would love to join ,1,241,51
hey i m not sure where to post this but i ve got 4 p5 hamilton tickets that i originally bought but turns out we have a lot of extra tickets  therefore selling for original price paid  just want my money back  send me a message if any of you are interested ,1,257,50
don t support scalpers ,1,23,3
i was already on the fence about paying  200 for a hypothetical front row lower section ticket  and by the time i got through the queue  also about 50 minutes later  the only tickets close to  200 were in the nosebleed section at allstate  needless to say  i didn t buy a ticket  i ll keep checking resellers and probably end up paying  150 for nosebleed seats in the end ,1,372,67
lowkey don t want to support resellers because of how they screw the market up so much  i ll see tho  ,1,102,19
i got the blink vip package and i m so excited  i ve never been to a concert before and i can t wait   ,1,103,22
i had to use ticketmaster  i was using a computer and logged in to my account though  ,1,86,18
at least i got to see red velvet  ,1,34,8
did you pay  600 for both ,1,26,6
because there will always be someone desperate enough to pay that high price  scalpers snatch up the majority of tickets within minutes  so  if you re a real fan who wants to attend the concert then you are left with an unfortunate choice  either pay the absurd price or don t go at all ,1,287,52
[next joke origin]  ,1,20,3
plenty of time to still grab tickets  they re a little more expensive on the secondary market but just skip the lattes between now and then and you ll be set ,1,158,29
haha i feel ya,1,14,4
i would be so down for this but i wasn t able to get the tickets that i desire so i m not quite sure it ll turn up for me ,1,122,28
they ve already made the money  but if there was a large amount of empty seats people would notice that something was off  it would be similar  but not as drastic  to snsd s black ocean  except instead of turning light sticks off there would just be empty seats  and no artist wants to perform in front of a nonexistent crowed even if they are getting paid  ,1,358,65
originally  the plan for me was to buy 8 tickets for my friends and i so we can all sit in the same row at the  154 price level  i tried the computer and was on right at 4pm  at around 20 minutes  i knew this wasn t going to work  called the ticketmaster number and ordered 3 sets of two tickets on three different calls  bummed that we are all separated but happy we aren t paying resell prices  i m just now worried because i haven t gotten email confirmation  has anyone received theirs ,1,490,92
me and a friend are traveling in from ut  i think that would be so fun  ,1,72,16
how do we tell if its floor ga or p1 ga ,1,40,11
i lost out on great seats because of this ,1,42,9
would their tour be considered a flop if it s sold out  but there are empty seats  they ve gotten their money regardless if people are there or not  the only people who would be harmed financially for empty seats would be the scalpers  maybe it ll show the companies that don t have fan protection at ticket sale that this system is broken  kcon last year had a staggered release of tickets  that helped a lot in securing them since i kept checking back  idk how badly those tickets were screwed by scalpers and bots as well though  also  i understand that kcon is bigger than blackpink so it was more warranted  i just wish there was a better system in place to buy tickets  ,1,676,122
because as soon as real live people got through the queue 45 minutes later  the only tickets left were  verified resale  tickets  literally no fan is buying tickets just to resell them within the hour ,1,201,35
if anyone has vip for fort worth for sale  or heck any tickets  let me know  axs cancelled my vip order tt ,1,107,22
honestly  i hate that for every single show that i try to go to  tickets are instantly up for resale  is there any way to let yg know about how ridiculous the ticket sale is going  i know they probably won t care  but maybe if enough people let blackpink and their organization know  they may void tickets  refund them and have another sale date  i know it s practically impossible  but i at least want them to know about the frustration we feel  i was still at work trying to buy tickets  so that put me at an extreme disadvantage  i m happy for people who legit wanted to see them and got tickets  however  tickets shouldn t be able to go up for resale within the first hour of sale  those people never intended to go to the show and are only preying on the fans  idk  i m just venting  but i m really upset that i won t get to go to their show  i honestly hope they ll be able to do another show  i m willing to even buy face value tickets for a same day show  scalpers and bots would have a harder time flipping those  i would hope,1,1035,197
it isn t just the artists  ticketmaster is owned by live nation  live nation owns resale marketplaces  live nation also promotes tours  so live national literally makes money for a tour happening  takes a cut when tm originally sells a ticket  then takes another two bigger cuts when a ticket resales  they have a vested interest in the resale marketplace  it s not just bots and individual people looking to flip tickets  live nation s resale market buys tickets from itself  ticketmaster  and sells them for more  now that being said  i expected these tickets to have a higher face value than they did  i wound up paying about  80 more than face for floor tickets but were still less than what i anticipated paying up front ,1,726,124
my cousin in atlanta was trying to get tickets and said on stubhub they were  450  1000   how is that possible  ,1,112,20
yeah unfortunately it s a problem not limited to blackpink but every artist with large demand  few artists would try to go out of their way to make sure fans got tickets  it takes a lot of efforts and resources to implement  if you haven t got a ticket yet  you could still wait around and perch for someone not being able to go to sell it to you with price closer to face value  don t give in to scalpers,1,405,78
they re supposed to be  the best recommended seats for the most passionate fans  or something but really they just have fluctuating prices according to supply and demand  they re meant to throw off scalpers and such but they re just tickets for above face value   ,1,264,43
pretty much means ticketmaster never even sold the ticket at retail pricing  and they are scalping those seats tickets themselves legally  fuck ticketmaster ,1,157,22
same toronto tickets are so freaking expensive   ,1,49,8
o what happened ,1,16,3
from their site    official platinum seats are some of the best seats in the house  set aside for fans by artists and event providers  official platinum seats offer safe and equitable access to up close event experiences  however they don t include additional amenities like merch or vip perks  i got two tickets in section 108 and they fall under official platinum  my friend got in before any of my devices and i just told her to pull the trigger and didn t bother looking at the price at all since i didn t want to risk not getting anything ,1,544,97
there s nothing special about them  it s a reserved block of tickets that are released to the public and sold  they usually go for higher than normal price than normal to take advantage of demand ,1,196,34
she s so beautiful damn ,1,24,4
i do lol,1,8,3
well that was a complete disaster  i ve been slighted by ticketmaster so much that i won t be going to any group that uses them for a long while  even though most groups will use ticketmaster ,1,192,35
then you better be blaming every single artist you see that uses them as well then  ,1,84,16
dont give up  check stubhub  i found some decent priced seats,1,61,11
they do buy all the tickets  if you look there arent any original price tickets anymore  all are listed as resales,1,114,21
congrats  i m sure it will be more than worth it ,1,49,10
ticketmaster or axs  i bought on ticketmaster and was able to choose  maybe sign in on a computer ,1,98,18
i found ga tickets for  250 on stubhub,1,38,8
i got my tickets  40 mins  every minute in the queue that passed was torture  i was losing hope  omg i can t believe it  i checked tm again and the tickets available for hamilton are from sellers and platinum tickets and the prices are ridiculous  ,1,248,45
just got my tickets  was waiting in line for 1 hr at fort worth  sold out waited for 1 5 hrs for la  got tired of waiting  went to stubhub and bought from a reseller for  250 ga floor my ticketmaster finally loaded  ga was going for  500  900  not a bad deal considering but still pissed that we have to deal with resellers and scalpers ,1,337,64
awesome   i don t have any k pop friendos so i m glad a fellow redditor will be near  lol,1,89,17
this happened to me   luckily i had 6 devices in queue  i dont understand why i wouldnt be able to purchase tickets on my laptop  it even said i could still browse   but whats the point if i cant buy them  ,1,206,41
because they continue to do business with them  it s a double edged sword and there s no good solution  but legend has it that f ticketmaster  ,1,143,25
they ve already made their money from the ticket sales  it doesn t matter if there are people in the scalped seats or not  ,1,123,22
why blame yg for something that s ticketmaster s fault  bots and scalpers happen to literally every singer and band in the world  ,1,130,21
after clicking blindly for a solid 30 mins got 2 ga tickets to la  rip bank account  not including my plane ticket ,1,115,22
nah  i m in canada so i got the hamilton tickets ,1,49,10
blindly clicking i got 2 ga tickets to la   bank account in tears   not including my  500 flight  ,1,98,19
i m in sec 122 too  i m going from ottawa ,1,42,9
yeah  i loved the mellow piano with a light beat in the background  curious how that would have sounded throughout  ,1,116,20
same here  sad life  amp  x200b ,1,32,5
you are partially right  basically aeg owns them for their whole west coast arrival  along with coachella  but in the end its up to them who they choose to do business with  nin and radiohead sold shows that you legit had to stand in line for  i want to give yg the benefit of the doubt  but lets be real  its k pop  they want every   possible  ,1,345,67
i m curious about this too  so if anyone knows the answer please tell me  when i bought red velvet tickets i wasn t allowed the option to do mobile either and it wanted me to pay to ship  so i just went with will call  but when we went to get our tickets scanned at the concert the other day everyone else had it up on their phones but i wasn t given that option lmao,1,367,73
i get the sentiment  i hate bots as much as anyone else  but showing the artist an empty stadium is punishing the wrong person  blackpink  and even yg  don t have control over how tickets are sold  that s all on ticketmaster  a large boycott of blackpink s concert isn t going to change anything at ticketmaster  but it will make people think blackpink s american endeavor was a flop and will ruin any chance of them coming back  ,1,430,74
somebody please tell me i didn t spend over a thousand dollars for three tickets to stand in the back     ,1,106,20
does anybody know anyone selling vip tickets to the la forum show  sob  ,1,72,13
got a p3 ticket in newark  hopefully it won t be too far away  ,1,63,13
i got in after about an hour in line and literally all of the tickets were resale and inflated 2 3 times as much as face value  my friend and i got p4 seats for the price of p2  absolutely ridiculous  ,1,201,40
aha  that s the problem  i was trying to watch it on my phone  ,1,63,13
i m section 108  row 4    can t wait ,1,37,7
still spinning but i got on on a different browser and bought a single resale floor ticket  good thing i m taller than most teenage girls    ,1,141,26
honestly  the only way this will ever be solved is if every blink who could not get a ticket at face value doesn t go  make people and bots who bought 40 tickets suffer and show the artist and empty stadium  really  fans should be treated better than this  ,1,257,48
anybody know what  official platinum  means on ticketmaster ,1,60,8
fuck ticketmaster  fuck scalpers ,1,33,4
it depends on demand  if demand keeps going up  all seats are sold out and many people are still looking and actively buying from resellers  then the price will inflate a lot  especially in the immediate post bloodbath  so unless you find a great deal from a fellow fan who just bought an extra ticket and isn t trying to make an easy buck  i d wait till much closer to the concert  or at least for a few weeks   oftentimes scalpers overestimate demand and in that case if it gets really  really close to the concert  like a few hours before   prices will drastically drop to even way way waaaaay below the original official selling price   amp  x200b  ideally  if you live near the concert venue and don t have to fly out and book a hotel and you aren t completely die hard on going to this concert  i d say the best deal you d get is to check ticket prices the day of the concert  ,1,883,160
if you re logged in  and in the pre queue i don t think so  it definitely won t help  it may lose your place in line  if you look at the bottom of the queue page there will be a queue id that s a long string of numbers and letters  in trying to circumvent the queue  i left a page open from before the sale with the queue on it  never refreshed it or changed it  but in another tab  if i would click  see tickets  it would pull up the same queue page with the same tracker icon and the same queue id  i even went through several captchas trying to look at like newark to see what re sale tickets were going for  you lose the queue if you back out of the pre queue page  like if you only have the one page open and you back out of it  you lose your place in line  if you straight refresh it  i m not sure  but i wouldn t risk it  if you want to try and screw around with refreshing and stuff  just duplicate the tab and look around in the second tab  leave the original queue page from the pre queue open and you for sure will not lose your place in line  ,1,1055,210
 69 tickets reselling for  460   are you fucking kidding me ,1,60,10
i called customer service to see if i could get a  50 back since it was a mistake on their part for putting up a wrong map of the venue  they said they were gonna see what they can do for me and set up a ticket  you should call and see what they tell u  ,1,254,56
anyone know if there are any ticket buy sell trade groups for newark concert ,1,77,12
awesome  nice find  ,1,20,3
same  i m trying to get ahold of resale vip but it s really expensive    ,1,73,14
floor tix  i m crying  bp in my area confirmed ,1,47,9
kinda want to buy vip tickets now as well as i didnt get the chance to get ahold of these tickets  really depressing  ,1,118,23
i m so upset  there are so many tickets available for newark but they are all resale at ridiculous prices  ticketmaster is garbage at handling these sort of things  welp  on to the blackmarket to search for decent priced tickets  ,1,230,39
absolutely insane how i had to pay the price of p3 ticker for p4 tickets despite being on ticketmaster at 3 30 and having to wait in the queue for an hour  i checked and now the p4 tickets are  re selling for  400  fuck you ticketmaster  ,1,238,45
holy crap  i checked 1 card and i have 4 pending charges  no wonder citi sent me an email asking to verify fraudulent activity,1,126,24
came to say i m pretty salty about missing out on p4s after waiting 2 hours  thanks axs for keeping me in the queue after everything sold out  anyway  hope those who made it in enjoy it  now to hope i don t have to deal with this again when utada hikaru tours  hopefully she will anyway  have fun all  ,1,302,58
spinning on a single ticket on the floor  is ticketmaster s site this screwed up ,1,81,14
i ended up getting in after an hour  all resale  i m so sad    maybe next time i ll just call them ,1,99,21
and this is why android users are the supreme race ,1,51,10
im in online but cant buy anything  amp  x200b ,1,47,8
you saved me  bless you ,1,24,5
i fucking hate ticketmaster so much  i made it in with reasonable prices and when i went to select my tickets  it told me i should sign in on a different device ,1,161,32
not likely  the tickets you bought were priced up but they were the only tickets for those seats  based on what i saw  it looked like the front few rows of seated p1 in the sections along each side of the stage were premium priced  if they were further up or in sections further away they were verified re sale priced up by scalpers ,1,333,63
pre queue for the la show proved my friend and i were unlucky today  unlike our red velvet experience  that said  i said fuck it and called ticketmaster express  after fumbling around for 10 minutes  i snagged 3 p1 seats on their phone automated system  not entirely happy with the section and row and choosing blindly  but at least i have tickets  meanwhile  my friend and i are still waiting with 2k  people in front of us in the online queue  ,1,446,80
yeah  i got in  but the tickets i saw were seats for  400  or so far back that you d only have the screen to watch  here s hoping for more dates or another tour  good luck everyone ,1,181,36
damn  so would refreshing right at the 4 00 start time or a few seconds before not help or hurt it  ,1,100,20
i felt like the way there did it was weird  they d show available seats  and then when you try to secure them  it ll say someone beat me to it already  and there were  premium seats   that aren t part of the package  that were like 3x the price next to a regular seat  i should be grateful that i was somehow able to get 6 p2 tickets for all of us that are going  but i really wanted to get p1 and see my girls as close as i can   i m honestly tempted to buy closer tickets from a reseller  but i didn t want to lose out on the chance of getting any tickets at all ,1,565,115
does anyone know why i couldn t do mobile tickets  i m fine with getting actual tickets but i really didn t wanna pay  5 to get them shipped to my house when i could just load them onto my phone  ,1,196,39
it isn t would guess i ve probably been to 100  concerts at this point  i m fully aware of the fees they tack on  this isn t a fee issue  this is them displaying one price in the cart and then another when it comes time to pay  axs also has an issue with payment processing  i m still waiting for  1500  in charges from axs to be reversed ,1,339,65
second browser did the same thing  could pick tickets but not buy them   ,1,73,13
so i ended up getting tickets to the chicago one lol  ive never been so we thought it would be more fun  hahha,1,110,23
given how quickly all of these are selling out  i have to imagine it d make financial sense to either do this again or maybe even open more tour dates  that said  i m not risking it  so i ll be scouring the secondary market for tickets over the next week or so and hoping i get lucky ,1,284,55
for the la pre que it was more like 10 minutes before 4 00,1,58,12
pre queue showed up  15 minutes before the on sale  but the pre queue is randomly sorted at the on sale time  so even if you hit pre queue before anyone else you could end up like 7 000 in line  if you join the queue at the on sale or later  you go to the back of the line  you re queue is tied to a cookie  so if you re logged in you stay in place  i didn t understand at first and tried refreshing  and re joining and trying to get around it  but it always came back up the same  their is a unique id tied to it  but people are right about multiple devices accounts because i tried in incognito after 4 and ended up at the back of the queue in the incognito window but not the window where i was logged in  even after refreshing  so  in summary  join the pre queue any time before the on sale time and then just cross your fingers  i joined pre queue and had to wait 50 minutes and not many face value tickets were left  ,1,923,175
my best friend  and fellow blink  is going to shaky knees the same weekend  so this gal will be solo  but i m sooooo excited that a kpop group i stan is actually coming to atlanta   ,1,182,35
i m guessing you re going to the la one  what tickets did you get  also  did you happen to see whether there is vip tickets on sale or no ,1,138,28
i really liked the remix of the first section of the song  ,1,59,12
anybody know how to sell a ticket from ticketmaster when the  sell  option is grayed out   i bought 2 premium tickets  but then my mom found better ones and now i don t know how to get rid of these    ouch  my wallet  hehe,1,222,43
like cantell said  seems like you chose the  axs premium  tickets that get sold at  market value        instead of standard tickets which sell at face  posted  value ,1,166,28
got tickets so excited p1 ga  woo ,1,34,7
yeah it s nuts  i waited in the queue for chicago for 50 minutes before i got in and i m pretty sure i got the very last p1 seated ticket at face value  imagine if you got stuck in traffic and got the website at 4 05  when i finally got in  there were already seats in the same section being resold at  560 when the tickets were  200 to start  madness  if you didn t get a ticket i d recommend waiting a little bit before looking for re sells  while i was waiting i looked at the uk shows and the re sells were a lot closer to face value than the same day stuff in the us trying to get people to panic buy  ,1,607,120
business wise it s actually crazy good  pay for basic upkeep of a few human beings  and basically all your other expenses are used to market and advertise  you don t even need to pay them much  since the fans to take on the responsibility because your advertising dollars got them to care enough to send your people stuff  exploitative  sure  immoral  sure  but smart  definitely ,1,380,63
might want to email them tomorrow  got all 8 of mine an hour or so after paying  ,1,81,17
not just axs  my friend got me 2x p1 tickets and according to the layout  they should be  198 each  two p1 tickets ended up costing me  1 120 ,1,142,28
at this point  i m just hoping that they have not released the vip tickets yet to the public  ,1,94,18
thanks   d,1,10,2
technically i was there an hour in advance  but apparently the prequeue starts at t 30 minutes  the prequeue seems to put you in a random place in the queue  then  without refreshing the prequeue page  you get sent to the actual queue  i waited there from 4 00 to around 4 50  after which i could buy my tickets  i refreshed my phone once by accident  but it only placed me a few hundred behind  ,1,396,73
i feel vip are given to the cult first before being released to the peasantry ,1,78,15
dude   2000  people in front of you  just forget it  thanks but no thanks ticketmaster  ,1,88,16
anyone have any thoughts on a show being added in na like they did with london manchester  i was sure they d come to new york and i was planning on going and saving up    but i can t make it out to new jersey on a weeknight  probably not gonna happen  right    ,1,261,51
still in line   ,1,16,4
nice  congratz ,1,15,2
same to you  ,1,13,3
but the thing is  i don t think they releaesd vip tickets as i haven t seen any scalpers sell it or the site itself  i could be wrong tho  i m only talking about la btw ,1,169,34
i wish i had a good camera  well  i hope you have a great time  ,1,64,15
when you realize k pop is the most brilliant marketing scheme ever devised and you despise it but also play right into it because you are addicted  i feel the only way to survive this is to embrace the pain  let it coarse through your veins  absorb it  and channel it into momentum  ,1,283,52
isn t this just heartbreaking  people who actually are waiting to see them live  and the chance is here    are actual blinks   amp  x200b  hope is all gone    dreams of seeing them perform live are slowly being stolen by the bots and scalpers    it s so unfair    ,1,264,45
a warning to anyone who received a message from axs when trying to buy tickets indicating that their credit card was declined  check with your bank credit card company  you may find that you were still charged  i tried two different credit cards multiple times and each time it said they were declined  i now have pending charges on both cards now for the cost of the tickets  they should hopefully clear off  but if this had been a debit card i would be in some trouble ,1,471,86
bots will buy the best seats  if you look online  they are already up for sale  i generalized  my apologies  ,1,109,20
even lower bowl  stubhub is selling them for 500 a piece ,1,57,11
huh then why did you say the bots bought it all ,1,48,11
thats great to hear excited for you   i was lucky enough to get tickets too   ,1,78,15
not yet  in line as well  but i m excited to see seats actually left  imagine paying 2k plus for ya standing  imagine  ,1,119,22
i wasn t able to get the atlanta tickets  pretty sad  ,1,54,10
i have two p1 tickets in section 117 that i m looking to exchange for two general admission standing tickets  if anyone has please dm,1,133,24
i m still in line  is everything sold out  ,1,43,9
so now you have 4 tickets  ,1,27,6
i just got two  i got them about 20 minutes ago  2  hours after they initially went on sale   they are section 217  row a   157 each ,1,133,27
the real queue starts at the selling time  so if your tickets are on sale at 4pm  refresh the page at 3 58,1,106,22
if this is your first time buying tickets  then welcome to the fee world  all sites do it  livenation  ticketmaster  axs  they all come with fees  you dont want to pay fees  go to the venue and buy them directly otherwise  you re stuck with the fees   there s so scalpers or anything  people who are getting different ticket prices is because they are probably choosing  best available   which will give them better tickets than what they thought they were picking  ,1,466,80
 gt  at about 2 minutes before the official ticket selling time  or before the real queue ,1,90,16
i ended up getting the ga floor tickets  my wallet is crying     but the queue wait time was super long for me  i was honestly stressing out   amp  x200b  also if anyone knows  is there a difference between the ga tickets  i got 2 ga1 tickets and a friend of mine has a ga2 ticket  would we still be able to go together or  ,1,324,63
ugh i m in the same boat  this is very upsetting  ,1,50,10
how long before official start time was the pre queue  then the queue  did you ever refresh  i messed up time zones and didn t successfully get tickets but i m also trying to go to another kpop concert and don t want to mess up twice in a row ,1,243,46
i feel you  waited for this and now  nothing  ,1,46,9
it s from axs website  lol this isn t something  i did  so i m not claiming credits for it   it s for info purposes  ,1,117,21
anyone able to get the la tix yet  if so  what were the prices  currently in queue right now ,1,93,19
is this a copy paste from the powerhouse faq  lol,1,49,9
icic  thanks    ,1,16,3
exactly  plus it may seem far  but i just went to see the arkells last week at scotiabank arena  i was in the top section completely opposite from them and i could still see them perfectly  so if that s the case  i m not too worried about firstontario ,1,252,47
yep  my browser crapped out and i couldn t buy the tickets i d picked    ,1,73,14
so for any of us who may not end up getting tickets  what do we think about the likelihood and or frequency of future na tours for blackpink  i know this is pure speculation  but i wouldnt mind being humored   p,1,211,40
is it just me or there s no la vip tickets for sale ,1,52,12
14 minutes and extremely limited notification  rip ,1,51,7
exactly  prospects looking bleak  ,1,34,4
is it just me or there isn t any vip for sale  ,1,47,12
yup  refreshed the page at 4 01 after my first page stalled out and there were already 2000  people ahead of me  expecting the worst at this point ,1,147,27
2k  with limited availability 6 minutes in for la  rip  ,1,56,10
as cool as it would be i don t think ariana grande would do it unless blackpink becomes well known in the west  ,1,112,22
oh no  that was what happened with me and that page never figured it out  i d open a second tab to be on the safe side and see if it puts you in queue  but the line is scary long already sadly    ,1,196,43
same thing happened to me ,1,26,5
i have this awful feeling my browser is going to screw up and i m not going to get tickets    i m sitting on a  sit tight  page ,1,128,26
ah  i see you are stuck in this same hell as well  fingers crossed we somehow break through,1,91,18
lucky  i got 2k  for me,1,23,6
yea  it s us vs half the us and seoul  people are legit flying their ballsacks out just for the la show ,1,104,21
rip 2k  in front of me,1,22,6
honestly  i wish i had a better spot but i don t i ll even think about it when i m there and enjoying the concert  lol,1,118,24
i was there 30 minutes before the presale lol  it started off at 2000   and it took over 50 minutes for me to get through it ,1,125,26
same  and it seems like they don t have vip tickets on sale ,1,60,12
yeah got into queue with 2000  people too  had to wait half an hour  but i luckily managed to get a good spot ,1,110,23
how did it double up like that in price   mine didn t do that  but i will say the  convenience fee  is way too high  how is paying for a digital copy so high  it makes no sense  a digital copy should be way easier to do and thusly be a smaller charge than asking for it to be mailed or whatever ,1,295,61
congrats  how many ahead of you in the queue when you purchased ,1,64,12
i was just about to give up  got my fort worth tickets for the price i was aiming for but not exactly where i wanted to sit  but  it s just to risky to keep trying in hopes i d get a better seat ,1,195,42
yeah  i am 2000  as well after waiting a whole 30 seconds to open a second browser page after the first one stalled out  this is so rough   ,1,140,29
thank you i got the ticket  lt 3 it sold out in 7 mins,1,54,13
looking like it s gonna be a long wait  ,1,40,8
thank you guys i got the tickets  lt 3,1,38,8
wooooooooo i got a ticket,1,25,5
are ga tickets only mailed if you buy them through the website  ,1,64,12
lucky you  2000  on each platform  garbo ticketmaster at it again,1,65,11
probably because you had  axs premium   market price  tickets selected instead of  standard   face value  tickets ,1,114,16
la  579 in front of me on 1 browser  2000  on the other 2   ,1,60,14
yeah  i m happy with my spots  i just can t justify  500 ticket to my wallet right now ,1,87,16
stub hub tickets are from resellers,1,35,6
my previous option was  500 for ga  and i thought it was too much money but now i kind of wish i would have just bought them for being closer and only an extra  160 ,1,165,35
has anybody started a discord group for this yet  i think it d be super awesome to meet some fellow blinks before the concert ,1,126,22
yep  its honestly all luck  when i bought tickets for bts it was so goddamn smooth  today  was on ticketmaster an hour early and by the time i got in everything was for resale ,1,176,34
i m in section 216  anyone gonna be sitting nearby  i d love to make some friends  i m coming alone from buffalo ny,1,115,21

yeah i had a buddy grabbing me tickets from his home and we were on the phone  he got in first and got 217 row 9  then all of a sudden i got in so he didn t purchase the tickets yet as i got 215 row 4 so i got slightly better tickets which we didn t want to lose haha ,1,268,60
i got two p2 308 locations for  360  convenience fee came to  45 and i did pay for the insurance thing just in case ,1,116,24
okies  thanks for the reply  got in  i guess it came later even though ticketmaster said 30 minutes before ,1,107,19
not necessarily  usually they would show standard tickets first  and then best available remaining tickets if standard tickets were sold out  if it was the first thing that popped up for you  it probably means there were no other standard tickets left so the next best thing came up for you ,1,291,51
lmao that was unexpected,1,24,4
i did dfw so axs  but ticketmaster should be similar but might start a later time ,1,82,16
damn so if i hadn t clicked premium i could ve gotten the same tickets at the normal price ,1,91,17
i couldnt get any tickets    now  if you excuse me  i gotta go find some form of motivation to finish my schoolwork for the day ,1,128,26
work it it  had my work pc  work laptop and my cellphone all going  got 2 tickets  not exactly where i wanted but i didn t want to risk losing them and getting nothing ,1,168,33
i think it starts at 5 min mark or so ,1,38,10
it s basically ticketmaster axs s tickets dynamically priced based on demand  so a different kind of scalping but it s technically legitimate so   ,1,147,20
i think i got premium    what does that even do,1,47,10
maybe you should flex a bit on  em and reap the benefits,1,56,12
i got tickets in fort worth  3 different devices  i got it and it said tickets unavailable  i had to keep going to the ticket page  eventually i didn t even have to wait in a queue  just had to do the captcha  finally got it and it gave me 2 options  some sort of randomizer and also p2  i just kept it on p2 and clicked okay over and over until i got some seats  i wanted the closer p2 seats but i wasn t going to risk it ,1,423,88
hey guys i m also coming from phoenix  az me and a friend of mine are going  we should try to get a group going if you guys are down  instagram is rayman_9297 if anyone is curious about getting a group  ,1,203,40
you probably either got  premium  tickets from the sellers or resale tickets from other buyers who hiked up the prices,1,118,20
i m going to buy vip tickets first and also try to get a pair of ga tickets as well  then i ll decide which to keep ,1,116,25
hey guys i m also coming from phoenix  az me and a friend of mine are going  we should try to get a group going if you guys are down  ,1,134,29
wahoo i got row 5 tickets for nj and vip tickets in chicago  ,1,61,14
you may have gotten verified resale tickets,1,43,7
my order for vip was cancelled and now nothing is available  congrats to everyone that could  tt ,1,97,17
not seeing the waiting room  anyone else ,1,41,7
i was on the site an hour earlier and didnt manage to get seats for atlanta   ,1,78,17
it loos like vip might be seated  the seating chart is confusing ,1,65,12
ok i spent way more than i planned but i actually managed to get tickets on stubhub ,1,84,17
awesome  thanks  i ll check it out when i m down there  ,1,56,10
yep  i purchased 3 at once,1,26,6
also  do you know what the waiting room looks like for ticketmaster  not seeing any button or sign for it,1,105,20
what a shit show  my two friends and i couldn t get seats  seats are already being resold for double and triple the price  fuck ticketmaster ,1,141,25
hi  how do i actually know if im in queue already  does the countdown stop  or the display changes  thanks ,1,107,20
my girlfriend bought us tickets without telling me so now i have 2 vip tickets to sell  message me ,1,99,19
use the mega thread ,1,20,4
insanity lol ,1,13,2
got it  thanks ,1,15,3
did anyone else notice this bs with axs  [  why  did the atlanta location have to only use axs  as bad as ticketmaster is  axs is far worse ,1,140,28
same here  i was trying to get p5 tickets  but there was no option to pick for it   ,1,84,19
damn  yeah  ticketmaster is straight bullshit  i m glad most of the other music i listen to plays small enough venues that they don t use ticketmaster  i also didn t really believe that there would be this kind of demand  i know scalpers pull tons of tickets  but these were big arenas and looking at the re sells for newark right now  it seems like scalpers still only took a fraction of the seats  ,1,400,71
so happy i got vip for newark  i m shocked i got tickets  i was in the queue for over an hour  ,1,95,21
2 had same log in  the rest were not logged in  the one that was 1st i had to log in when i bought the tickets  ,1,112,26
lol no  honestly i was triggered when i couldn t get tickets to atl  but i luckily found them and bought them resold  ,1,118,22
i ve tried several times but i ll check again  ,1,47,9
friend and i got vip  see y all all there ,1,42,9
does anyone know if they re selling official t shirts at the na tour stops  ,1,76,13
yeah that was lowkey worry me    they should ve worded the ticket differentiation better but i check too and i got the  403 blink vip  ,1,135,25
i got vip too  see you there  ,1,30,8
axs continues to show  axs premium  tickets available for sale for the atlanta show   amp  x200b ,1,97,15
hi did anyone else get charged the p2 prices for a p3 section  the map on axs was confusing and even had a p5 section when it wasn t even announced  this for the forth worth concert  ,1,183,36
same same ,1,10,2
no problem  ,1,12,2
so i was stuck in the queue for over an hour for chicago  however  when i got in  i saw several vip ga tickets for about  403  it s a frustrating queue for sure  but the fact that i wasn t constantly told  oops sorry pick another ticket  was actually good  ,1,257,49
thats the beat news thank you  ,1,31,6
same here  i was worried cause the tickets just say ga admission but on the app  in fine print  it says blink vip  i m so excited  ,1,131,26
i bought two tickets for  572 and change  your  299 will be more than enough to cover,1,85,17
oof  that sucks  i was already seeing second hand sites trying to sell tickets for well above the going price before the tickets even went on sale  so i m sure there were a bunch of bots that ate them up quickly  it s so frustrating,1,232,44
totally awesome  was watching and noticed it immediately  just imagined hearing the black pink in your area  d ,1,111,18
45 minutes to go for la  i m in panic mode already,1,50,11
buying tickets for a show is such a terrible experience it s ridiculous  i m always in queue half an hour early but can t beat bots or scalpers ever ,1,149,27
agreed  this is horrible ,1,25,4
saw some tickets on seatgeek  i m gonna go for it  there s a code to get  20 off your ticket  ozkural,1,101,20
were you guys able to purchase 2 tickets for 1 checkout ,1,56,11
ticketmaster is a mess  you can be the first one to join the pre queue but it doesn t matter cause it s random  so basically it s all luck  then once i got my tickets in the cart  it told me that i could not purchase tickets on the device i was using but was free to browse tickets  i m lucky i had 6 devices open or i wouldn t have been able to buy them  ,1,356,72
i was recently in a crippling depression and i know this sounds stupid or whatever but blackpink saved my life  i discovered their music and that s what kept me going in my darkest days  i could not believe it when they announced their north american dates and the only canadian city they were playing was my home city of hamilton  even though i can t really afford  300 for tickets i decided to treat myself and have an amazingly cathartic experience after everything i ve been through  i was in the pre queue well before the sale opened  and when i got in there were still a lot of tickets left  including standard ga   i tried to buy ga repeatedly and got errors  i tried every other seat i could see and got errors  error after error  over and over again as the seating chart showed seats disappearing  i was not able to buy any tickets at all  now the seating chart is lit up with red resale tickets  it seems like 30 40  of the stadium is available from  verified resellers   what a complete joke     ,1,1007,183
was your total about 292  im cutting it really close with 299 in my account and the bank being an hour away,1,107,22
i went recently for a small show and yeah it s much smaller and more intimate than phillips or the building formerly known as the georgia dome  so it should be great  also  if you don t know there is a cool kpop store in duluth called the kpop store they sell light sticks and square up ,1,287,55
sitting in 218 row 17     if anyone s sitting around lmk   ,1,59,11
where my vips at     i m so excited    ,1,39,8
where my vips at    i m so excited    ,1,38,8
please dm me if you got 2 extra tickets and wouldnt mind selling it at 170  cad  my friend and i really wanna go but it s just so out of budget for me when i see the reseller prices  gt _ lt   we promise not to bite if we end up sitting beside you ,1,248,52
i managed to get the tickets i need  but the atlanta show sold out in less than 30 minutes  already being posted on resale sites for over  1 000  i hate that people but with the sole purpose of reselling for a profit when there are people out there who are actual fans and miss out on the opportunity because of these people ,1,325,62
i also think it s so dumb how all the remaining seats can only be bought in pairs so someone doesn t have to sit by themselves  wtf  what if the group has an odd number of people  and how is not being able to see them at all better than the experience of sitting in separate groups ,1,282,56
you re lucky  i wasn t able to get a ticket  now they are ridiculous prices    the view was fine  i guess it depends on how big their stage is  i was in 117 and i had a good view of the screens  ,1,195,42
friend with benefits texted me saying he got vip tickets with his coworker and here i am with nothing  well it s over,1,117,22
i managed to get the tickets i need but the atlanta show sold out in less than 30 minutes  already being posted on resale sites for over  1 000  i hate that people but with the sole purpose of reselling for a profit when there are people out there who are actual fans and miss out on the opportunity because of these people,1,323,62
i got ga   sound check tickets  convenience fee    27 85  facility fee    10,1,76,15
i think maybe scalpers  some of the tickets were priced as advertised ,1,70,12
hard nope  this will only be a negative for bp as haters will say they needed a huge western artist for their western popularity,1,128,24
no sound on phone for some reason  works fine on computer ,1,58,11
yeah it s even like that still  fighting for overpriced tickets now,1,67,11
hoping the left side of the right most section at allstate still gives a good view of the main stage  it was  quite literally  the only list price p1 seated ticket left when i finally got in  re sales were already up to  560 and that s too rich for my blood ,1,258,49
this is some grade a bullshit right here   amp  x200b ,1,54,9
is there no sound for anyone else or is that just me ,1,53,12
they were  platinum  tickets  which are  dynamically priced  based on demand  and you have to buy them in pairs  it s a total scam they pull off ,1,145,26
sure it wasn t scalpers immediately reselling  because when i was looking there were 9 tickets in a section priced at  560 but still 1 seat in that section priced at the listed  198 50  i think it was the very last p1 seated seat available not on re sell ,1,255,47
for phone  did you use the app or mobile browser ,1,49,10
didn t purchase for bp but i do see some avail for instant download ,1,68,13
couple of youtubers i follow say seatgeek is good  whether or not you ll get awesome seats is another question  i just know its supposed to be decently priced for a resale place  ,1,179,32
i wanted an assigned seat but i just gave up and got ga   sound check ticket  i hope people who are standing in front of me are shorter than me haha,1,148,32
i got 2x premium axs floor ga for sell in fort worth  ,1,54,12
does anybody know why tickets were so much more expensive than listed  i payed 830 for 2 row 3 tickets to the fortworth concert,1,127,24
anyone got the email from axs  the tickets show in my events tab  but no confirmation    ,1,89,17
yeah  that s why i was confused  i am positive that in the past i have held reserved tickets in my cart for the 5 minutes that they give you  i had the timer for reserved in my cart  but as soon as i left the ticket page  they were gone ,1,237,50
oh they actually played a bit of it  i thought it was just a still,1,66,15
finally got in but it s literally all resales  i got in 5 minutes before the tickets went on sale so yea   kinda mad lol,1,120,23
i gave up on the fight  prices to high ,1,39,9
same here  same here   ,1,23,5
got the vip tickets  i m gonna be going from scarborough  but i ve yet to decide on how i m actually getting there lol ,1,119,22
thanks  got the resale price is crazy ,1,38,7
oh wow  i m up in 215  i had a coworker helping me from his house  so we had 3 desktops  1 laptop and 1 phone haha  his computer got in first followed by one of mine but by the time all was said and done  the remaining three were still at 2000 ,1,244,52
yeah when i finished the queue there were only p3 and p4 tickets left  and i still had to fight for it lol ,1,107,23
got p1 tickets  section 108      man that queue was scary  when you suddenly see 2000  ahead of you      how about you ,1,119,23
the seating chart posted previously is different from the seating chart on ticketmaster atm  i don t know which one to go by anymore  the only on ticketmaster doesn t have the prices on them either smh  ,1,203,35
i feel that  i luckily work in a department with 3 computers near each other and a very understanding coworker and i was just a wreck for the last hour ,1,152,30
thanks for trying to get people in the chat  you re the goat  ,1,62,13
so if you re waiting in the pre queue when the queue starts  you re randomly mixed into this big queue and can either be next in line or have to wait a bit  if you refresh while in the queue  you will automatically be put to the back of the line  however  i recommend opening your ticketmaster about 10 minutes before and at about 2 minutes  refresh the timer  because that will give you the option to join the pre queue  the button didn t come up automatically for me  after that  sit back and wait  as for refreshing the tickets  ticketmaster is the wooooorst with updating their tickets  plus here in canada ticketmaster actually crashed and then sold out   so once you select tickets it ll probably go  oops those arent available  and then you can click to try again nearby  sometimes that works  like yesterday when i bought alexisonfire tickets  rip my wallet these past two days   sometimes you just have to move on and try another set  how it worked for me today   that s up to your discretion ,1,1002,176
tickets are so expensive  i can t go huhu,1,41,8
i got my tickets  good luck on everyone else getting theirs  now i need to get a hammer ,1,88,18
just get in queue early but people say timing doesn t matter  queue is random placement  i had 2 phones   3 browsers  2 browsers had me in the middle front of queue  1 phone at stuck at the end  1 phone and 1 browser where in the very front  all random,1,252,51
i m trying not to spam so i ll share this info with them  we have someone on our discord server that s looking to connect with other atlanta blinks  specially for hotel info  if you are interested or want to help  you can find them under  other concerts [  ,1,257,46
did your bp ticket instantly download ,1,38,6
are you a scammer  lol,1,22,5
yeah i had no idea about the pre queue as well  i was sitting on the page though long before the 30 min queue start but i guess i had to refresh  ,1,146,31
i ve bought off stubhub and it was instant download for the tickets  maybe depends on what kinda ticket  idk lol ,1,113,20
the ticketmaster app    i had great seats and then i went to buy them  and it just kept spinning  i have fantastic connection  but it would put me back to the join the queue page  and then take me back to where the ticket options were  i did that several times until my  place in the queue  was no longer valid  it s so not fair  ,1,330,65
 gt we have someone on our group looking to connect with someone in atlanta  if you are interested  look for them under  other concerts  gt   gt    amp  x200b ,1,159,25
anybody who got ga for the concert  how much were the fees ,1,59,12
we have someone on our group looking to connect with someone in atlanta  if you are interested  look for them under  other concerts [ ,1,134,23
 gt   t know if this has been mentioned but if anyone is not able to get tickets on axs  i would try stubhub  i just purchased tickets there very easily  their stupid app  i had great seats and then i went to buy them  and it just kept spinning  i have fantastic connection  but it would put me back to the join the queue page  and then take me back to where the ticket options were  i did that several times until my  place in the queue  was no longer valid  it s so not fair  ,1,478,95
really  i heard people to say to keep refreshing  or is that only to refresh the tickets they show you ,1,103,20
got tickets for section 107 and 224  how is the view from that angle  should i stick with 107 or 224 ,1,101,21
blown away at ticketmaster surge pricing ga tickets to  450 00 while the soundcheck tickets were still  253 50  they re essentially pre reselling and it s unreal that it s legal ,1,178,26
what website ,1,13,2
is all general admission tickets just first come first serve i m terms on where u stand  i m seeing ga tickets that say different row numbers,1,141,25
[galaxy unpacked video  bp part beginning at 1 02 28]   through 1 02 44,1,71,10
u donttrustdaniel u maplegiraffe how d you make out ,1,52,6
learned reserved doesn t count  went to pay and said ticket gone   amp  x200b ,1,78,12
whether you join the queue 1 hour early or 1 minute before makes no difference  but once you re in the queue don t refresh  it may seem long but it is slowly advancing and eventually you should get there  i went through it for hamilton and got lucky but it can definitely take awhile ,1,284,53
i m sitting at my desk at work  shaking because i m so nervous lol  an hour to go for me to get in the queue  ,1,110,24
i tried to buy tickets four different times  each time i clicked buy it would spin and then bring me back to the queue page  i d try to buy again and eventually my place in the queue ran out  so no tickets for me  ,1,214,44
it is that future strategy office of theirs  suengri is behind it all ,1,70,13
30 mins before is when the queue opens ,1,39,8
question for the hamilton concert  is general admission all the same  i m seeing ga 1 4  any difference ,1,104,17
oh no  i ll be crossing my fingers for you,1,42,9
this was my first time trying to buy through axs  hopefully it will be the last  livenation ticketmaster has never tried to pull sh t like this  i understand scalping  but what s the point of displaying a completely inaccurate price ,1,233,38
i have never bought tickets before  but i was seeing people talk about seatgeek so i went on there and bought two tickets from them  it still says processing and i read on their website that the tickets are never guaranteed until fully processed  what has peoples experience been with seatgeek  i feel like i still can t celebrate until i know for sure that i have the tickets ,1,377,68
how early should i start to queue for ticketmaster  im going to the la,1,70,14
the ticketmaster pre queue messed me up  trying to find a reasonable ticket now for newark ,1,91,15
resellers selling nosebleeds for  199      sorry i love you blackpink but my wallet can t shoot that shot,1,105,18
scalper bots got all the tickets immediately ,1,45,7
toronto hamilton blinks  roll call ,1,35,4
if you were not able to purchase tickets on axs like me  i would try stubhub  i bought them very easily on there ,1,113,23
same thing happened to me   i was so upset because i was seeing this around 15 20 minutes after they went on sale  i would go to check out and the tickets would double or triple  its ridiculous  i think its just people reselling their tickets after buying them at the regular price  which should be illegal tbh  this has been the worst ticket buying experience ive had and ive gone to several concerts ,1,402,73
i was gonna buy from stubhub but i dnt really trust them since they aren t an official retailer  it s like secondary sales ,1,123,22
have you tried to look on stubhub ,1,34,7
i m in sec 122  i m traveling from new brunswick so i would love to make some blink friends ,1,92,18
did you try stubhub  i couldn t get them on axs for atl too but i bought them very easily on stubhub ,1,101,21
after queuing for tickets  i got a message  there are currently no tickets available   then i reloaded the page  and boom    seats  good luck everyone ,1,151,26
i got a ticket for 122  what s your opinion of the view in that area  any pros cons  ,1,85,17
don t know if this has been mentioned but if anyone is not able to get tickets on axs  i would try stubhub  i just purchased tickets there very easily ,1,151,29
i was going for atl  but that s a dubb now  for some reason it seems like atl was the most popular location ,1,108,22
and i agree with you  i like blackpink  but i m not paying  1200  for two tickets  my wife would kill me ,1,105,21
i already accepted my defeat  ,1,30,6
i am about to give up  find a seat and it s no longer available lol,1,67,15
they varied but i would try stubhub  just bought tickets from there very easily ,1,80,14
cuz they tryna trick us   it yg s scheme lmao ,1,46,9
you too   which show are you going to ,1,38,8
that happened to me  it was really annoying ,1,44,8
when i added them to the cart they were still face value  wtf is that about  why would they triple in price at checkout ,1,120,24
i keep getting no tickets available,1,35,6
same happen to me  oh well enjoy lol,1,36,8
i got the blink vip in chicago and i m just so happy i was able to get it  i m a mess right now    lt 3,1,103,24
stubhub isn t an official ticket broker   it s used for secondary sales ,1,72,12
i don t know what happened to me but i managed to get chicago tickets in 3 minutes    was aiming for p2 but accidentally got p1 tickets and when i realized what i had done i was already checking out so    i m going broke lol,1,224,44
hi  i m in dallas  and just got tickets  i d be down to hangout before the show  ,1,81,16
ohmygod the same thing happened to me  they re most likely platinum tickets   better seats  kind of pissed that we weren t told there would be more tiers of pricing within the sections  i was only looking at the seat maps provided by the tour site  i grabbed two tickets quick and when i was paying i was like why are these three times as much   i went for it still  they re great seats but damn it was expensive,1,412,78
double  oh please the prices went up at least 300  percent and i refuse to pay  1100 hundred dollars lol,1,104,20
does anyone axs tickets not show up on the upcoming events tab ,1,63,12
i saw tickets for atl on stubhub so i had to double check ,1,58,13
seems like atl and dfw are both on atx,1,38,9
it is now 5 18pm   1 hour after on sale time for atlanta  oddly enough  i am seeing tickets pop up on the axs site and multiple times i have clicked on the ticket and added it to my cart only to see the price of the ticket double or triple when i got to checkout  wtf  ,1,269,54
huh  idk why axs had the countdown for the other concerts until two hours ago when they didn t plan to sell them  but this is good to know  thanks ,1,147,29
off topic but aren t p1 tickets around  200  why am i getting  500 haha,1,71,14
this queue system is bullshit  what happened to fastest click in the west  at this point i m sure chicago is sold out  hopefully scalpers won t be asking too much  ,1,164,29
ticket sales map as of 2 10pm [ ,1,32,7
i just bought a ticket for fort worth through axs  no problem  going by the tour announcement i believe that la  chicago  hamilton  and newark were primarily through ticketmaster  and atlanta and fort worth were axs ,1,216,36
an hour later  i finally got in   aaaaand only resale tickets are available  starting at  169  ,1,95,15
it s disgusting that the venue could allow this  people are going to have to pay up to 3 times the original price from scalper sites what a rouse  ,1,147,28
as per what people have been saying i tried seatgeek to purchase two tickets pretty easily for a reasonable price 200   ticketmaster is still being pretty crappy for me no matter how hard my guy runs t t ,1,204,37
i was looking at la and that s the one that dropped suddenly for me  maybe they just had the countdown but had no plans to sell them there  either way  good to know  thanks ,1,173,34
i reserved 2 good tickets at a good price  accidentally hit back  and lost them  now there are no decent tickets available   amp  x200b  nice ,1,142,24
for real   jesus  why would anybody but  650 platinum tickets in the upper deck when there were  400 vip packages available  smh  thanks for the info,1,149,26
yeah i just found out about stubhub and bought them from there  ,1,64,12
only atlanta and i think somewhere else were being sold on axs  everywhere else is on ticketmaster  ,1,100,17
have you been to that arena before  i don t think i ve ever been there  it looks to be primarily used for concerts and hockey which makes it seem smaller than a normal arena  i bet there s not a bad seat in the house  ,1,218,43
platinum is ticketmaster reselling the tickets on their own platform for higher prices and calling it  platinum  it s total bullshit ,1,133,20
i was very much hoping for ga but i ll take what i can get ,1,59,14
1 hour and counting  still lists 2000  ahead of me  i am about 80  down the little guy moving line    ugh  i despise resellers ,1,127,24
i haven t  but have had friends who have bought sold successfully  i was sure to buy the insurance  too  just in case  but that s an extra  10 per ticket  it s supposed to be an electronic transfer through axs s own app  flash seats  but who knows  hopefully this isn t a huge disappointment   bought the ticket s for my daughter s birthday ,1,341,58
omg  i just booted up my computer because i had in my phone the tix going on sale at 5 instead of 4  i m not sure if i would be angrier in this situation or if i had actually missed out at the right time      looks like it s the resale market for us  ,1,251,54
same here  every time i try to checkout with tickets the page won t load  their system must be really overwhelmed with viewers right now but that s no excuse  lets still be hopeful though   ,1,190,34
ever bought through stubhub before  would you recommend  even though i know it s not the first choice   ,1,104,17
im so emotional right now wow this is pure stress,1,49,10
same here  waited an hour prior to the queue opening  no notification anything was available   and now i m waiting here for almost an hour watching this bar barely move ,1,169,28
that s so disappointing  i thought the  waiting room  was supposed to help clear from bots  sad    ,1,99,17
i wasn t able to get tickets through axs  either  as soon as i was let in through the waiting room  the tickets i selected already sold out before the page refreshed     i just bought through stubhub  ,1,201,37
anyone else have a problem with the seating map just not loading up after the queue  by the time i got a map to appear everything i clicked on was already sold ,1,160,32
i got an atl ticket but i cringe to even check to see what the resellers are trying to pull  ,1,93,20
351 people on front of me for 10 minutes now  losing hope ,1,58,12
i got the blink vip package   i didn t understand what the platinum ones were    but 650 is a bit much  the ones i saw weren t even on the floor  are there box seets or something  anyway  all i cared was early entrance  so stoked for this  ,1,240,46
just got mine   2 in section 108     ,1,37,8
bummer   but thanks for the heads up  ,1,38,7
scalpers took all the tickets  i called the arena and they said they were already in checkout bins the moment they went on sale  that should be illegal  ,1,153,28
i really am sorry  i m sure if you looked on social media or on the websites you might be able to buy resales  best of luck  sry again,1,134,28
so stub hub isn t officially selling tickets for atl  ,1,54,9
same here  sorry man ,1,21,4
it s good  congrats on the tickets   ,1,37,6
we thought that they wouldn t sell out quick either but we were wrong  i had to get my friends theirs because they couldn t get on the site  it was insane ,1,155,30
not that anyone can do anything to really fix it  but the fact that some of us are still stuck waiting while stubhub already has a ton of tickets up for resale really grinds my gears  sigh ,1,189,37
i m so sorry  i had to refresh and refresh and barely got tickets  i had to buy my friends  because they couldn t get on  ,1,122,24
yup i just got vip too  ,1,24,6
which venue ,1,12,2
in there now  only p3 standing ga sound check vip package left ,1,63,9
nope  got in the queue before 4 pm  got access to view tickets around 4 10  and even after 30 mins  ticketmaster wouldn t let me select just one ticket to even put in my cart  i m monitoring seatgeek and stubhub  tickets i saw on tm are being sold for at least 2x the cost on these sites  all standards price tickets sold out  and all i could do is watch them disappear  ,1,371,71
is everyone in the same queue ,1,30,6
they were available  looks like other sections were being sold at surge prices or whatever they call it,1,103,18
this makes me super nervous for bts next week    ,1,49,9
for real  bigbang  red velvet  epik high and bts were all easier ,1,65,12
was in the queue for a while but then decided to look other places  found some on stubhub for a decent price  got two tickets in section 210  by the time i got in on ticketmaster everything cheap was gone  glad i m able to go even though the seats aren t the greatest ,1,268,52
i joined queue for nj at 3 30 and i m still waiting to get in  lol  my guy s moved almost halfway down the line now but it still says 2000  ahead of you,1,152,32
same here  it looks like scalpers got to it first sadly,1,55,11
download the app  i had been in queue on my computer before my phone and was only able to get tickets through the app on my phone  good luck   amp  x200b ,1,154,30
i would to know this as well  seems it s like a 50 50 shot  at best  if that  did anybody get tickets ,1,102,21
my ticket is in p1 seating  section 116  i think row e  i wanted a seat in section 106 107 116 or 117  ,1,103,20
i think that s what happened to my friend  she made it in a few times but then it crashed  she did eventually get a vip ticket though so hooray  you re right though  it looks totally sold out now  joined queue for ga just for shits and giggles and i got the sold out message ,1,275,54
i got 2 for soundcheck out of shear luck  every time i ve used ticketmaster before it would just crap out on me  as recent as red velvet  keep trying  ,1,151,29
yup  the refreshing was crazy  had to change rows sooo many times  but yes  don t give up ,1,90,17
see you seven there ,1,20,4
got one  only took 30  minutes in the queue  honestly  it was easier to get bts tickets   ,1,90,18
got lucky and qued up 20 minutes early still only able to get p2  still i m excited ,1,84,17
i got in but all the tickets are being sold at a platinum price  pretty much ticketmaster scalping the good tickets  sec 9 at  600  each,1,136,26
i m rather unimpressed with axs and their ability to handle transactions  it also would have been nice to know that you could queue up before 4pm  ,1,147,26
my dude moved a whole bunch  i am getting nervous excited,1,57,11
my lil dude just moved to right under the p in people ,1,54,12
the place actually became a samsung showcase for the s9 place after bp house ended   ,1,85,15
i feel like no matter how much my guy moves the number of people in front of me never changes lol,1,97,21
atlanta sold out in 10 minutes  got lucky to get p2 ,1,52,11
friend just got in a lot of tickets were still available  including sound check,1,79,14
i got mine  sec 122  row 9 i was torn between that and standing but it seems like a really good middle ground  it took me a while to get in but keep refreshing  lots pop up ,1,173,37
i got vip tickets and my friend just got vip tickets too right now so there s still a chance if you re in queue ,1,112,23
nooo  i thought i was early and it still sold out  guess i ll have to buy from scalpers resale now   ,1,101,19
thats just not fair idk why it didn t pop up on its own  i was already there for over an hour  welp next time i ll know to refresh at the 30min mark ,1,149,32
that s so annoying  i thought this system was to get rid of bots and scalpers  ,1,79,15
how do i know if i am no in queue for chicago   ,1,48,12
see you in hamilton    ,1,23,5
i m still sitting at over 2000 people also       ,1,49,9
i got tickets 4 times for atlanta and i couldn t even pay    i used 4 different credit cards and there was an error for all of them and i lost each of the tickets ,1,163,34
not far  but he moved ,1,22,5
my dude just moved ,1,19,4
i feel for you  i got shutout of atlanta as well ,1,49,11
what seats were left ,1,21,4
i got my tickets in p1   i got in after having 2000  in front of me during the queue  be careful of clicking on a platinum ticket   it has its prices inflated due to demand and it s just a ticket  ,1,197,41
i was on site hour before  in queue 15 min  went and refreshed page  site crashed  had to literally click hundreds of times for best available seats to get ga tix  in the meantime waiting to pay  i had another tab that refreshed and said it was all sold out  it s fucking insane and i hate this site  ,1,301,58
im scared to ask but was soundcheck still available ,1,52,9
ayyy i got the seats i wanted with my friends  3 of them in section 219  ,1,73,16
are you serious  i m on my phone and when it finally got to the captcha prompt  i do the stuff it asks me to do  and then i get another prompt  but it wont let me click on the checkbox to try again  i m afraid to refresh  not to mention my laptop went all blue screen while i was in queue  ugh     ,1,298,62
yep same exact situation as you     ,1,36,7
exact same thing happened to me,1,31,6
and there are 1 845 tickets already on stubhub  definitely not a coincidence ,1,77,12
thats me as well,1,16,4
i got lucky with only about 500 people ahead of me  but i secured my ticket  sadly when i got in  the better seats in the upper level were gone ,1,144,30
i was stuck waiting like that for 10 minutes and finally got in  didn t get the exact tickets i wanted but still got p2,1,119,24
still stuck  2000  people in front of me  had no idea about pre queue ,1,70,13
ugh  totally crushed  tried to get my daughter 2 tickets to the atl show  got in the waiting room as soon as it opened  and it sold out before we could get some  was going to be a great first concert for her ,1,208,43
looks like atlanta is sold out  ,1,32,6
ah  another soldier in this war  ,1,33,6
i m not sure  i m actually baffled by how painless it was  i will note it was on my laptop through a web browser  i had the phone app too    that wouldn t load at all  ,1,168,34
still stuck in the queue,1,24,5
i watched the video just now to see if i could find out what the username was  turns out that the name of the caf  is printed on the cakebox on one of the pictures  so the blurring makes no sense  [ ,1,199,42
when mine finally loaded they were sold out  good luck,1,54,10
more  i clicked on the chicago link on axs  it gives you a redirect link to ticketmaster so you re good   amp  x200b   amp  x200b ,1,130,22
i will give you a heads up that i tried getting vip for atlanta to see how much of a headache it will be and it took 20 minutes of refreshing but i finally was able to get a ticket in my cart  so i m hopeful it goes well for dallas  good luck blink    apparently the prequeue for fort worth opens at 3 30 on the ticket purchasing page  so get ready for that ,1,358,73
my guy hasn t moved for the past 10 mins ,1,41,9
i m stuck in the queue too  terrible system  i m not optimistic but we ve waited this long already so we might as well stick it out ,1,132,25
good decision  even though its a joke  i m torn between this and the new xiaomi ,1,80,15
i m still gonna wait in this line just in case    but it s not looking too bright  hopefully they just add more shows,1,117,22
oh boy  that fits perfectly  i can t even remember this scene from bp house ,1,76,14
y all are making me nervous for la,1,34,7
didn t get mine too many people were in front of me   ,1,54,12
omg thanks for the info  i m going to have axs ready just in case  amp  x200b ,1,78,15
ugh  i m so afraid i m not gonna get a ticket  been in queue for over 20 mins and i m on 1 4 the way  ,1,102,23
thats me alright  amp  x200b ,1,29,4
got in the vip line as soon as it opened up  and when my queue finished it said no tickets available   ,1,103,22
i m a first time kpop buyer for fort worth too  i hope my group can snag some tickets before they sell out super quickly  best of luck to everyone ,1,147,29
confirm  no atlanta date on ticketmaster  i see the illinois date on tm and axs so plan accordingly  ,1,101,18
lol literally me  i m not taking any customers at 4pm  if needed  i have my phone ready and logged in to ticketmaster  just in case i have to  excuse myself to the bathroom   amp  x200b ,1,186,34
[   are we sponsored by samsung    oh yes  ,1,43,8
same    crying right now   ,1,27,4
2000  ahead of me still this system is a mess  i had similar issue with epik high,1,81,17
i think it varies depending on which venue  some i think are selling them at both spots but i can t be sure  let me check to see if there are ticketmaster dates for atlanta  i can confirm that mine came through axs for atl  ,1,224,44
axs kept redirecting me to ticketmaster  how did u   ,1,53,9
oh ok  that s super cool ,1,25,5
same thing happened to me  i loaded the ticketmaster page 50 mins early but few mins before the tickets went live  i wanted to look at the seating chart  i clicked on a link accidentally from the venue s website and it bought me to pre queue which i m probably too late for ,1,274,51
this is kind of insane  i did everything super fast and i m still in queue  i expected high demand but this is beyond my expectations  ,1,135,25
i guess i ll throw my iphone away for a samsung ,1,48,10
i ve made it past the wait queue twice on both the axs app and on my pc  and both times it craps out after that ,1,112,25
what city were you trying for  what website  ,1,45,8
jennie said she really loves the cake designs created by that pastry chef and she follows her on sns  anyone know the account for that pastry chef  can t seem to find it and they blurred it out in the episode  ,1,210,40
nah  i got tickets  in the best possible seating for p4  too  dead in the center  sorry to hear about georgia  keep refreshing ,1,127,23
this isn t a commercial  it s the reveal of the galaxy s10 in a 2 hour long presentation  ,1,90,17
i didn t know anything about pre queue was on the page 1  hours before  now there s 2000  people ahead of me in line  ,1,118,21
hopefully not too late to save you  all tickets for the georgia concert were gone within 4 minutes  missed my chance because i wanted to see exactly where in the venue my ticket was going to place me  because of course we can t have that information displayed on the same screen as seating information ,1,302,54
i didn t get tickets  i m infuriated  are there scalpers  do you think they might add more dates  because i am losing my mind right now  i had everything planned  i did everything right  and i didn t get tickets     ,1,216,39
no  it was the official launch event hold in san fransisco with over 500k people watching live on youtube ,1,106,19
oh okay right    ,1,17,4
it s local time so it s only 1pm right now ,1,43,9
i somehow got a vip ticket  they sold out immediately    my friend joined the queue before me and somehow i got a ticket and she didn t  we re trying to at least get her a ga ticket so she can try to squeeze her way up to the front with me but it s looking bleak t\_\_\_t still have 2000  in front of me for the nj show though which is a lot closer to me lmao  from va   ,1,371,77
no issues here  i got the tickets i wanted  i was in the axs waiting room 30 minutes before    at 4  the page refreshed and boom  tickets secured  ,1,147,28
 gt axs wait  are they selling them through ticketmaster or axs ,1,64,10
note to you guys  i was able to get my atl tickets no problem    and right where i wanted  if you re going through axs    they have a waiting room that pops up 30 minutes or so before they go on sale  good luck chicago ,1,219,44
absolute madness this is,1,24,4
i don t see it for la  ,1,23,6
that sucks i was on the page 1 hour early and the pre queue didn t pop up until the last minute  had no idea i was supposed to refresh yikes,1,140,29
is this for the korean commercials only ,1,40,7
what is general   onsale and axs premium general admission which one should i queue for if i want p1 ga floor with soundcheck ,1,126,24
the pre queue is live on ticketmaster now  refresh your page if you re not already in it,1,88,16
exactly  and no one is forcing people to buy vip tickets  really weird people are so caught up on price of vip tickets  vip tickets are always going to cost a bit more,1,167,33
for anyone going to one of the shows that sells the tickets through axs  you can start queuing up online now  i was able to preanswer the captcha ,1,146,28
you go to the web site 30 minutes before sales go live  you click on buy tickets  it brings you to a screen that says you are waiting in line  you sit there and look at that screen for 30 minutes  when time is up and you eventually get to the front of the line it automatically loads the page to choose seats and buy tickets  you can also use the ticketmaster app ,1,364,73
if you are on the page  when the countdown reaches 30min prior you should be automatically entered  if not  refresh your page  if there s a button that you have to click to enter the waiting room  then click that  though i m pretty sure this is an axs thing  not ticketmaster   by the way  ticketmaster should assign you a random place in line if you re worried about not entering the queue right at 30min prior   amp  x200b ,1,425,75
from where  i haven t seen an presales ,1,39,7
for axs  the queue has already seemed to start for atlanta ,1,59,11
they will sell out within minutes  you re not just competing with blinks  but with scalpers that will put tickets up for resale at four times the price  it s best to stay logged in and have all your information good to go  the rest is just up to luck really  i doubt the vip packages will sell out quickly  if at all  because the profit margin for scalpers is less  but individual tickets will be gone very quickly ,1,415,77
if you have ga standing tickets but arent right at the stage in the beginning  can you make your way to it or is that kind of impossible ,1,137,28
still won t make it a good phone  ,1,34,8
we are almost at the zero hour of tickets going on sale for the first na tour   amp  x200b  t minus 26 minutes  ,1,112,21
blackpink on your    \   amp  x200b ,1,36,5
hamilton is a pretty sketchy city  and there really isn t much to see other than a few restaurants and maybe some parks  nothing really special  i wouldn t change anything if it were me because i had a great experience sitting in line too  everything was very organized,1,269,47
red velvet tickets sold out in 2 minutes  but more were available like 5 min later if you refreshed  the key here is to grab them asap  but if you dont get them  dont be discouraged  theres still a chance  refresh and try again  i d recommend logging in now  making sure your cc info is inputted and use multiple devices if you have them available,1,347,65
good luck   i m lucky enough to live only an hour from la so the trip is pretty easy ^ ^ and i got presale tickets    ,1,118,24
we really don t know  but i would expect them to sell out rather fast  so be ready when they go live  that s the best bet  ,1,123,25
have one already  ugh  i may have to sneak home to buy the tickets and come back to work hahah  ,1,96,20
p1 ga is standing  regular p1 is seated,1,39,8
i really wanted to see em up close so i m hoping i get two  i saved up my paycheck just for this,1,96,22
no thanks,1,9,2
my anxiety is through the roof right now so i understand you ,1,61,12
no thanks ,1,10,2
i m always checking back and forth ticketmaster just to check  i m kinda anxious about getting tickets for me and my sister ,1,124,21
i do get what you were trying to say now    i m all for healthy debate on reddit ,1,81,18
rip to ft today,1,15,4
try making a ticketmaster account  ,1,35,5
i love that jennie and lisa made a red velvet cake,1,50,11
did you all make an account with ticketmaster  that might help  i made one and i ve been sitting on the countdown page for hours without issues ,1,144,26
well ok maybe i should have worded that better as  the collab would probably be blocked because of the case of cl   i m really not trying to bring down cl because i do love her since 2ne1 era  that remark was really though made in sarcastic tone that any yg fanti could have a little chuckle  but it s not like it s baseless ,1,325,62
i d go with the link from the main part of the thread at this point    i did see a ticket price range posted on the infinite energy site and it pretty much lines up with what the picture above shows  i hope you get good seats  ,1,227,46
im sorry but i really dont see the point in making assumptions about how business tactics work while simultaneously bringing down an artist that us blinks are known for hating on unfairly    and everything you described would be the work of their managers and higher ups  not cl blocking something  there s countless reasons for this not happening and cl really wouldn t be our first concern ,1,392,65
is your link correct  i only see the same info from the regular event page in axs    am i missing something  sorry  i m kinda stressed out about getting tickets   ,1,163,30
i m not getting blocked as a bot  i think   but i m getting a 401 not allowed error,1,83,17
this  give us full album of new material first then we can talk about collaborations ,1,85,15
hey    i m from edmonton  amp  i m actually looking to travel to hamilton alone too   ,1,86,14
in the mean time there is this  [  ,1,35,8
you have to realize it s gonna be harder for bp to collab w ari because cl is a factor in the equation  scooter could probably flex and make the collab work only if cl  his other client  gets a chance for a comeback in return  yg holds the power on cl and her releases are dependent on yg  but scooter and ari has lots of freedom from their label and can certainly release stuff if they want to if thank u next was of any indication  ,1,434,86
i think the ga soundcheck will be sold with the other regular tickets and the  400 dollar vip ticket is to be sold with the blink vip package  as for why i think this  the price ranges listed for tickets is  67 50    257 50  now  going off the prices supplied from yg  the lowest should be 63 50 and the highest  ga soundcheck   253 50  so if the lowest is  4 more  we assume that s a fee  service  tax  etc  and seeing as how the highest price is also raised the same  we can assume that the 257 50 listed in that range is the ga soundcheck ticket  as for axs premium  one redditor once described it like this   gt for those planning on buying axs premium tickets  it s essentially the same thing as ticket master platinum tickets  axs will sell you overpriced tickets in order to  help  you from getting scammed from third parties  think before you purchase  they aren t special seats  they are regular seats which are sold to people who want the tickets  but the event sold out  if you have the money  go ahead  but  most of us don t have that much money  so i suggest you make sure you aren t spending money you don t have  so think of the axs premium as a way of buying select  the supposed  best   seats from the pool of regular seats at different prices  depending on demand   rather than going in and selecting seats by yourself  this means that axs premium could get you to the ga soundcheck easily  or it could not  i ve never tried it so proceed at your own risk  tl dr the ga soundcheck tickets can be purchased from the leftmost option  tickets  axs premium is supposed to be an easier way to get the  best  seats  but its functionality is questionable  please try to read some reviews before you decide to use it  anyone who has good things to say about axs premium  please contribute ,1,1799,323
anyone attempting to get tickets getting blocked by ticketmaster  my work has fast internet and its detecting me as a bot  oh the irony ticketmaster   ,1,151,25
yes 4pm  this is the newark chat if you d like to join   ,1,57,12
dude i know that   so what  and both ariana and blackpink are signed to umg    but do you think that s how the world works  if cl had the power to do that she would at least have the power to have a comeback,1,207,43
too much internet for today,1,27,5
no thanks  i still don t like her since the donut licking incident  she appears to have embraced the diva attitude  the same one that infected christina aguilera  they believe their own hype  there was nothing negative about dua lipa  so while i m not a fan of hers  i liked the collab  i m down for more collaborations with artists like her ,1,342,59
cl and ari shares the same manager remember,1,43,8
see you six there ,1,18,4
it s very difficult for most people to understand vip  if everyone can afford it then it is not vip  i am flying in out of state to watch the concert and i don t have time to camp from 10am to get to stand at the rails  i will pay for vip if i can get it so i can be there upfront  so to me it is worth it  what is 150 more on a trip that is already close to 1k  ,1,363,82
do y all think if i come later  i m coming after work  for p1 ga i would have a better view from p1 seated  ,1,108,23
i m getting blocked from ticketmaster because my work s internet is too fast apparently  anyone know some workarounds  ,1,119,17
this isn t as bad as i thought i m going to try and get a ticket for sure now  ,1,79,18
tf does that have to do with anything  i m sure cl is gonna call her bff ariana grande and tell her to  block it    ,1,116,24
here we go  another dj snake fiasco  haha,1,41,8
i want to go to the la concert date but it interferes with school    and i m not comfortable confident enough to travel to any of the other locations alone lol so i m hoping for another tour later in the year or something that i ll be able to go to with them lol feelsbad,1,271,53
to me it s not worth it  but worth is in the eye of the beholder  everyone s perceived value is different,1,105,20
it s not even just blinks tho  some of these kpop prediction accounts literally has 100k  followers   and whenever they make a tweet people reply like it s something confirmed when it s literally just a guess by a random person  i just don t understand the interest in those sort of accounts ,1,292,47
the sick thing is the resale sites already have tickets up with ridiculously jacked up prices  they are selling section 109 tickets for la at  1250  i ll be damned if i pay scalpers that much of a premium  good luck to us all ,1,226,43
the worst  predictions  i ve seen are people saying bp will absolutely flop hard in 2019 and give little to no explanation as to how they got to the conclusion  like no  that s not your prediction  you just want and wish them to fail ,1,234,43
going for p1 or p1 ga ,1,22,6
ariana grande is the biggest pop star in the world currently  i agree  i see no chance of her willing to collab with some kpop group  ,1,134,26
i understand and your motive is very good  but personally i don t think advising directly works for blindsighted fans  many of them are just    hopeless   ,1,155,25
cl would probably block it tbh ,1,31,6
you shouldn t just believe in  predictions  of a random twitter account  they just make up random things  there isn t more to it than that  real predictions need evidence and a working model to use that evidence ,1,212,36
well making fun of them won t really help  have to point it out as reasonably and possible,1,90,17
chicago here  i got a timer at work so i don t miss it lol btw ppl on fb are already selling fake tix    ugh  i hate the bookface  also reminder for chicago blinks  we have a discord server  if you want to connect with other blinks in your area  specially if you are planning on going solo [  ,1,293,58
  this is what s on their website but it really don t say ish ,1,62,12
base on my experience  vip packages are going to gone fast with this prices  i have gone to kpop concerts conventions that have a value of much more and sold out in about  5 seconds  this is just base on my experience and it could be different this time ,1,254,48
i see  i concur  and haha  the op of this very thread is literally believing the  prediction   lol this is really funny ,1,120,22
no  not after that japanese tattoo fiasco  she does even respect asian culture properly  she s a culture appropriator lol  she s a joke  ,1,137,22
and quite honestly  the vip doesn t even look like it s worth it ,1,65,12
oh absolutely  it makes sense as well  the main kpop audience are rather young people who on average simply lack perspective  i am 26 years old and thus a grandpa in this scene  can just and try to bring reasonable opinions into this fandom and hopefully some people learn from it ,1,281,51
i lined up early on ticketing day  there were a lot of frantic faces on the line so i asked them what they are getting  most of them are ga or and some seated premium ones  i m getting the vip standing soundcheck  400 usd  so i was less anxious  got my ticket after 2 hours on the line  ga tickets we re all gone by noon and vip tickets like mine  soundcheck and sendoff  was still available in the early evening online   amp  x200b  tip  if there are more than one place to buy tickets in your area  choose the one which will be less likely congested ,1,552,105
not too outrageous for it being called the vip and all the stuff that is included with it  as well as them being the largest international kpop group currently ,1,160,29
i think the irrationality of fans  especially k pop  is a global issue lol,1,74,13
i view it as pathetic though  i would like to say to them  just get a life ,1,75,17
yes funny though how people are so obsess with this prediction thing  pretty lame and funny  i had a real good laugh when i see a prediction like lisa is in a relationship  will fall in love with older man   jennie and kai will buy boat together  etc ,1,251,48
sadly the only canadian stop is across the country from me  but congrats and gl to all the eastern canadablinks that get to go  cant wait for the fancams ,1,154,29
if this is going to happen in 2020 i bet their song will be of course a bop and maybe they can break the most views in the first 24 hours,1,137,31
i d worry more about getting new music out before bothering with any collab ,1,76,13
i think one of the reasons is that many blinks are still  babes in arms        they are endlessly overhyped for bp  or other idols  ,1,132,24
lol the max yg can plan in ahead is a week ,1,43,11
i just want an album with only them and that all of them get a solo song,1,72,17
i have never understood why so many people follow these accounts and take them so seriously  maybe it s wishful thinking that makes people so intrigued  i really don t know ,1,173,29
here s the setlist from the singapore show in case anyone is interested   amp  x200b  [   amp  x200b ,1,101,15
it s hard to tell with this being their first american tour  but  i do think they will  especially newark and la,1,112,21
i asked him her if the collab will happen this year or 2020 and he she said its probably gonna happen in 2020,1,109,21
i am talking about the big ones which  covered  the dj snake thing  they definitely are real  the problem is that they were not rational and other fans aren t either so it all was a big letdown in the end with a lot of misinformation ,1,234,45
to be honest  we don t even know whether they are really  fanclubs  or not  anyone could say almost anything on the internet nowadays     ,1,138,23
doubt it would happen,1,21,4
all these so called  predictions  are senseless  enough is enough ,1,66,9
saying no to any big collab would be dumb at this point  it can only help to get more eyes on bp  with that being said  can we stop making things up  didn t we learn anything from the dj snake instance  btw  the bp twitter fanclubs didn t apologize for spreading misinformation   ,1,280,51
yet again that s fucking outrageous,1,35,5
in amsterdam its still not sold out  so yes  it was very easy ,1,62,13
fhe thing says both cost  198 so i dont see the problem  ,1,57,12
vip is the standing area reserved around the isle and front stage  the picture is inaccurate and should ve made that distinction  of course u get early access to choose where to stand  ,1,185,32
it s guaranteed  just poor wording on their part  ,1,50,8
yeah  that s a nope from me ,1,28,6
love ari  but i don t think she would do this tbh  at least not any time soon  ,1,79,17
i feel it s guaranteed since you pay for it  it was a raffle in other bp international concerts  they probably mentioned  chance  as in its available but if you don t arrive early enough to enter when they let everyone in    oh well you missed your chance  ,1,257,46
i honestly can t find anyone that like kpop as much as i do so it s night to know i m not alone  ,1,97,21
i can see it only happening with only 1 of the members like lisa  jennie or rose  still very unlikely though   but not as a whole group  but who knows ,1,151,30
doubt it and nope ,1,18,4
maybe  all i want is an album ffs  ,1,35,9
that s the vip package for hardcore fans  you make it sound like the tickets start at  400,1,90,17
thank u  next,1,13,3
400 for a ticket fucking outrageous ,1,36,6
axs has a countdown on their website when it will be ready ,1,59,12
hello fellow utah blink  i have never commented before  but was excited to see someone else from utah  i didn t really think there would be much kpop love in utah but that just shows how great blackpink really is  hoping to go to the newark concert  good luck ,1,260,48
i work in it  will have my desktop  phone and a laptop ready to go ,1,67,15
anyone know if the newark tickets go sale at 4pm est ,1,53,11
wfh    but yes  i ll be smashing keys for about 20 minutes straight around 4  ,1,78,14
see you five there ,1,19,4
same  sadly we might have to pay resell  ,1,41,8
i d imagine it s being there super early but i can t confirm that  that would probably also vary by venue  that s the reason i m passing on the floor seats  ,1,157,28
just wondering how fast you think these tickets will sell out  i ve never been to a k pop concert before and was wondering if they usually play venues this large and if they sell out fast  how fast have similar groups sold out in the past  i m trying for chicago so i m really hoping to get tickets  thanks,1,306,57
perhaps [this]   was the closest interaction between karl and jennie  jennie received a bouquet of roses from chanel last year during her visit to paris,1,152,25
i was going to go to the canada show  but like always  my plans to work my school s musical came first and thwarted my plans  tt the same thing happened when i was going to see day6 in canada  ,1,193,39
a singapore blink here  went to the blackpink in your area concert in singapore  it s a definitive must go  the concert was really amazing  music was good  the crowd was hyped  the night was truly magical  all the best to the us blinks getting tickets ,1,252,44
one is floor other seated ,1,26,5
so who s going to be at work smashing keys in hopes of getting a ticket ,1,72,15
for floor seats you have to be there early to queue right  i read somewhere it was based on when you buy your ticket but i ve also read that it s by when you get there  i don t want to have to be there super early just to get a good spot ,1,238,51
see the four of you there  ,1,27,6
good luck everyone  hopefully i can get some atlanta tickets     ,1,65,11
whats the difference between the two options  ,1,46,7
see thats what i wanted to do too and we could bring home some fireworks but that drive is gnarly  ,1,99,20
rest in peace karl lagerfeld  you have inspired many for many decades ,1,70,12
thanks  this is the first time i ve seen this  wow  i ve never seen jisoo tear up before and that made me tear up too  she was so sweet how supportive she was towards jennie ,1,174,34
see you three there  ,1,21,4
i m so sad y all  i might not be able to go    plan was to save most of my paycheck from last friday and use that to buy tickets tomorrow  but my job messed up and somehow my hours weren t entered so i got no paycheck  i ve been trying to solve this bs for going on 5 days now  it should be fixed now but i doubt i ll have the money when tickets go on sale tomorrow    i really might borrow some of the money i have saved up for a car because i really want to go  there were 2 other kpop acts i really wanted to see on their na tours but they re not coming anywhere near me so when it was announced bp was going to be in my area i knew i had to go  but even then idk if i ll be able to get access to that money in time  i m so pissed at my boss     rant  but good luck to all the other blinks out there  i really y all get tickets and good seats    ,1,849,182
korea it girl slaying ,1,22,4
bingo  i am waiting for her response too like everybody else,1,60,11
im travelling from az too  but im planning on going to the tx show lol,1,70,15
good luck to you too  im traveling from arizona and im really stressed about trying for the la show too  we picked the most popular one for sure,1,144,28
 gt  thank you for shairng your intelligence and generousity with the world   truely a legend  we will remember and appreciate your existence forever [source]   ,1,161,25
if i get tickets i ll be flying in with a friend  i d love to meet up with any other blinks so feel free to reach out and stuff    ,1,131,29
i d almost rather never have the opportunity than miss out on it ,1,65,12
at least you have a chance to buy tickets   blackpink in your area does not apply to me ,1,88,19
well  you can go to the ticket selling place and line up there  or just wait online  or line up while waiting online  it s different for every country  ,1,152,28
for me it s 5 pm  so if you are in ca it will be 4 pm,1,53,16
i m wondering    when they ve toured around asia  do they put the dates on their shirts  ,1,89,15
how does this  line up  thing work  do we just go to the website early ,1,71,15
as much as i hate to say it  if i can get a close p1 seat    i don t think i can pass it up  ,1,93,24
thanks for the pics vids  i m familiar with shows    i go to dozens every year  i m just not sure if it s worth it to stand in line early to get a p1 ga standing area bracelet or number when i could be exploring whichever city i visit all day  i m normally upfront for every show but this will be my first kpop concert so i m strongly considering p1 seats just so i have a view with little to no headaches  ,1,407,79
yes axs is the official seller for the atlanta tickets tomorrow at 4 pm est ,1,76,15
within an hour ,1,15,3
kentucky here  i m aiming for atlanta too  if tickets sell out at 4pm est    i m aiming for chicago    ,1,103,19
i have a feeling that la will sell out quickly and second date will be added  ,1,78,16
does anyone know the ticket sale time for ca  ,1,46,9
ft  worth here  it will be 4pm local time  set an alarm  good luck  ,1,68,14
i don t know what i m gonna do if i don t get tickets ,1,54,12
do you know if sound check is guaranteed  seeing how the faq said  a chance to attend sound check  for soundcheck p1 ga ,1,120,23
hello dallas too  should be 4pm cst  ,1,37,7
i m planning on getting the vip too but i wouldn t worry about it selling out soon  it s so expensive and i could be wrong but i don t think many people will be fighting over a  400 vip package  ,1,195,38
no problem   ,1,13,3
not gonna lie  i am kind of nervous  i know tickets go on sale at 4pm for the dfw concert but i dont know what time zone  i ve worked extra hard to be able to buy tickets as close as possible to the stage so i am gonna be pretty bumbed if i dont get the ticket i want  ,1,269,59
no    to go unfortunately  but im super excited for all my fellow blinks who ll get to see our queens live   ,1,109,22
i think it is  i can t find the atlanta tickets on ticketmaster for some reason ,1,80,15
best of luck to you  hopefully you and i can both go ,1,53,12
same for fort worth  only axs for fort worth venue ,1,51,10
i wasn t originally planning on trying to purchase tickets either  the main reason was financially  as i already have some big expenses coming up in april  however  i m lucky enough to be able to work overtime if i want to at work  so that s exactly what i m doing to make up the cost of the tickets  probably be 3 paychecks before i do though ,1,344,64
and is axs the exclusive vendor for the atlanta show ,1,53,10
i m not seeing the atlanta show on ticketmaster  did axs get exclusive rights to that venue  ,1,93,16
see both of you there ,1,22,5
i m at a place where i can go  it is very close to me  but i m not sure if it s financially smart of me to go at this point  i may try  but i m feeling unlucky  ,1,161,36
episode 5 of  we will channel you  the first episode with bp  yes,1,65,12
gotcha  thank you ,1,18,3
thank you for the link  however  which episode number is that and is that the only subbed episode out atm ,1,106,20
yes it just doesn t have the sound check,1,40,8
is p1 ga on the floor ,1,22,6
i was planning to go to the chicago show  but my gf is a bts stan and since they just announced their tour today as well  im gonna use my   to help her get tickets for that instead  so im a little sad i wont get to see our girls live  but  im excited for all my fellow blinks    ,1,279,61
i live in the uk and missed out on london tickets but good luck  fellow us blinks in this sub    ,1,97,21
it was like 15mins for london but i think it will depend on the city  la will have the biggest demand b c of it s big asian community ,1,134,27
you can log in to the same account at the same time across multiple devices  there should be no problem looking or purchasing tickets this way  however  as previously mentioned while you re looking through tickets and refreshing  ticketmaster may lock you out of some of your devices because they ll think you re a bot  you can always clear your cache cookies or log out and log back in but since time is of the essence  i generally switch to another device   amp  x200b ,1,471,80
see you there ,1,14,3
hey that s still warmer than utah rn  ,1,38,7
this is there first na tour  they have only ever done concerts in asia  so it s unknown,1,87,17
i m aiming for georgia so i can also visit my bestie  ,1,54,12
it s fucking cold  fellow utah blink  let s go to la  ,1,54,10
any veteran blinks know how long it usually takes for the shows to sell out  i d assume instantly lol,1,101,19
can i log into my ticketmaster account on a web browser  google chrome  and log into the same account on the ticketmaster app on my phone and try to buy tickets from both devices simultaneously  or can i only access from one device ,1,232,43
hello fellow utah blink ,1,24,4
good luck from toronto  i will be  hopefully  be heading to the hamilton show  ,1,79,14
well  i was lucky because i was able to buy my ticket from the pre selling of tickets in my country  but i think it ll be a real bloodbath out there with the sites crashing because of too much traffic or the lines at the ticket booth  you can line up while waiting for the online ticket selling for higher chances of getting a ticket  ,1,335,63
good luck everyone  may all the odds be ever in your favor    ,1,62,13
i was thinking of making a post exactly like this but just couldn t muster the courage  so  thank you  and good luck to you and everyone ,1,137,26
[here you go]  ,1,15,3
so i read the faq but the ticketmaster site will selling an official platinum package as well as a vip package  what is the difference  and cost  ,1,146,27
bless you for this hirez goodness ,1,34,6
thanks for the advice  ,1,23,4
i don t think there will be  i think all vip will be floor ga ,1,62,14
i ll be going to la concert as well and i don t have anyone to go to  would love to meet fellow blinks ,1,103,22
i can answer this one  it will be tough  i went to bigbang concert and oh man  it was a whirlwind of emotions when i was getting ready to buy the tickets  my only tip is that if you don t see the ticket that you want  just keep in mind to always refresh  ,1,255,53
aw  i would have probably done the same thing  eating  gt  standing in line  never been to this venue  so i hope it s not too confusing  ,1,137,26
yea it is standing floor ,1,25,5
okay thanks for the info  i had similar experience with bigbang and that time  we were kinda dumb  my friend and i ended up arriving at the place at 7 8ish then we noticed that there isn t any line so we decided to get breakfast  after we finished breakfast  hold and behold  there was a line forming behind a building and we just didn t see it the first time  yea  dumb move in our part ,1,388,74
yeah it kinda got hot  but i don t remember it being hot because i just remember being absorbed by the performance lol,1,118,22
i found it here      plan visit  gt  venue faqs  gt  general admission whether they follow the rules is another question lol  i tried to look up previous concerts accounts on that venue  but couldn t find much details on lining up  i think exo  got7 and g dragon previously performed there ,1,290,49
thank you  i hope their ep can at least add some more songs before then lol,1,75,16
hi  i m planning on going to the forum for their concert and was wondering where did you see this stuff regarding camping and lining up at 9am   ,1,145,28
which episode should i start from for bp s feature  also which eps are subbed and where can i watch them ,1,105,20
ah cool thanks  i guess i ll just need to hold the coat  [,1,58,13
you can bring your coat with you  you just can t bring a camera or your backpack  but a small bag  like a purse shoulder bag  was fine ,1,135,26
what are you allowed to bring  also is there a coat check  caused i d hate to have to carry my coat ,1,100,21
good luck and have a great time  hope you get a chance to go  even if it isn t soundcheck    i d go too  but i don t think its worth paying  600cad for a few songs and covers ,1,175,37
thanks for the info  hopefully  yg artists have the same format  i read for [bts they had separate wristbands]   soundcheck seems cool  but i m a bit scared of ga pit    short height  lol  yeah  i also figured they may not enforce the rules depending how strict they are   also  damn that s crazy cold   hope you didn t have to stay out too long  ,1,347,63
aaaa thank you so much i was worrying about this today  d,1,57,12
it was the same wristband  only difference was that you had to show your electronic or physical ticket  but at the sound check line to watch them  they did tell the regular ticket members to move aside for the soundcheck members  iirc  they said the doors open at 11amest to receive your soundcheck wristband  and we got there around 10am where there was about a 90 person lineup already  they did say that people would get kicked out if they were lining early  but almost every early rule they set in place wasn t enforced  my sister and i got wristband  77 and  78 which got us to row  3  and by the time winner came out  everyone rushed to the front of the stage  it was pretty fun for the most part though lol  planning was pretty shit because it was sub  30c weather  and they didn t let us wait inside the ticket sales room  before entering the foyer   in addition  there was one girl handing out wristbands  this all would ve been a lot more efficient by bringing another person  ,1,987,180
i m from la and definitely down to meet up with fellow blinks     see you all there   ,1,86,17
no worries  this is how i believe it is broken up as  so  p1  i believe stands for premium 1  then we have premium 2 and so on  [ticketmaster seat chart]   so all the vip  floor ga  general admission  and p1 ga will all have tickets on the floor  standing  no seats  now vip are the first to enter the venue followed by floor ga as both come with sound check viewing  next will be i m guessing the rest of the ticket holders  so p1 ga will also be allowed on the ga floor  but wont be there for the sound check  p1 is for the first set of seats in the lower level  p2 is for the rest of seats in the lower level  p3 is for the first sets of seats in the 2nd level p4 is for the last set of seats in the 2nd level  amp  x200b  i could be completely wrong on this  but like i said this is i think it goes   amp  x200b  hope this helps  amp  x200b   amp  x200b ,1,858,173
did you have separate wristbands for soundcheck and ga  and did ga also have numbers   how early did you line up  for the forum in la  they said no camping and they ll start giving out wristbands at 9am ,1,203,38
could you explain to me which sections p1 ga  p1  p2 means  lol sorry ,1,70,14
it is standing floor,1,20,4
have only watched the first ep in eng subs   ,1,45,10
of course   here s a video that kind of gives you an idea   ,1,60,12
ah ok  thank you so much   ,1,27,6
it s not super far  i d say about 30 50 feet  on the ga portion  there s a ton of empty space behind where people stand  so there s just an empty gap between the p1 area and the stage  with the people obviously congregated around the stage ,1,240,44
oh ok damn ,1,11,3
oh man  how about p1 seats  is it far from the stage  ,1,54,12
for ga  if you want to be closer  you have to wake up super early  people were camping out a day before the concert even  and that s only for the venue  there s also the merchandise line  which looked like this     ,1,215,41
no  this was broadcasted on the korean tv channel  sbs  ,1,56,10
wait a sec  doesn t the concert start in the evening around 7 8pm  and i have to be there  6am to secure a spot again   sorry this is my first time going for a kpop concert  ,1,174,35
is this on v live  ,1,19,5
you can move about freely  but what s really annoying is people congregate at the front and on the sides of the a ans b stage and sit in front of the stage to save  their space  before the concert starts  the earlier you get in line  the closer you are to the stage  for reference  i got in line at 6am and was wrist  580 or something  it was crazy ,1,349,70
i m planning on going for a p1 ga for the hamilton concert and i have a question  since p1 ga is standing  is there a specified spot where you have to stay or can you move about freely  also i m 5 6 and i m afraid that i won t be able to see them lol  ,1,252,54
my sister and i got sound check for winner s show in toronto and it was really good  though a bit too short for my liking  so essentially  what happened was that you line up early to get your wristbands to enter  our wristbands were marked with a number on them  the earlier the better as you will be getting closer seats  1 100 100 200   we ended up coming back 2 hours later to line up again for the actual soundcheck  at this point it doesn t matter where you line up because they end up placing you in order  when it came down to the actual soundcheck  the guys came out in their regular outfits and sang a few songs and interacted with the fans  tip  they ll tell you not to take pictures and all that  but do it anyways lol  my phone broke a few minutes before this  and my regrettably sister forgot hers  we were so close i could see seungyoon and seunghoon s acne scars lol  but the members were really interactive with the fans for the most part  and it was well worth the   300cad for it  it might be a little different for blackpink s as a result of having a larger fanbase  but i think it ll be similar for the most part  ,1,1134,214
i went to this venue for the bts concert  and it only had 2 levels   1st was ga p1  but pricing differed based on location and distance from stage  and the 2nd floor  here s a photo that you can kind of make out   ,1,214,43
so i went to the bts concert in hamilton  and what they did was let the people with soundcheck in a couple of hours before the concert began and then let them back out after about 30 minutes  for reference  soundcheck was around 2 30 3 00  we got in the concert at 4  and it started at 6   this was for ga  people waited in line  regardless of whether they had soundcheck or not  for hours days before they got their official number  around 11am  we got our wristbands and then were able to walk around town till we got back in line at 2  there were separate sections after we got back in like that corresponded to the numbers by the hundreds  0 99  100 199  etc   i didn t have soundcheck  but the people in line with me did and said it was amazing  a decent amount of eye contact  waving  and interaction too  basically  people from soundcheck went in a separate line for about 20 minutes and came back to their corresponding place in the line to get into the venue ,1,968,178
so i went to the bts concert in hamilton  and what they did was let the people with soundcheck in a couple of hours before the concert began and then let them back out after about 30 minutes  for reference  soundcheck was around 2 30 3 00  we got in the concert at 4  and it started at 6   this was for ga ,1,306,60
stubhub can be a good resource to get tickets to sold out shows  but a lot of stubhub sellers pretty much prey on unexperienced  anxious ticket buyers  they re listed at overinflated prices before sale because they do plan on getting tickets  but they plan on you  the ticket buyer  absolutely striking out on ticketmaster axs sales  feeling flustered and desperate  and deciding to drop  400 on their ticket  that they might not have yet   amp  x200b  also there s talk that there are actual people employed by ticketmaster that are in this scalping game too  so it could be those people for all i know  but yeah  never buy from stubhub before tickets actually go on sale  and if you can t get them on ticketmaster  don t go looking on stubhub right away  ticket prices there are going to fluctuate wildly between initial sale and the show date  and they re going to be the highest prices on sale day and about a week before the show ,1,935,161
weird but got swag lol,1,22,5
thanks   ,1,9,2
why don t they copy ariana grande and do a q amp a during the soundcheck  i wanted to meet them and stuff but the send off just seems so weird to me    maybe next time i suppose   lt  3,1,185,37
i believe there are p1 ga and just regular p1  each are the same price  you need the p1 ga if you want to stand ,1,112,25
i m so sad that i won t be able to attend because it s far too expensive for my financial situation right now  and i  just  went to rv s concert  but regardless  i m really proud of the girls and i hope that everyone that does attend has an amazing time ,1,254,48
leaning towards seated  you ,1,28,4
 [  this is how the tickets prices are broken down and at the bottom it show what is included in the vip packages  found this on another reddit post  hope this helps,1,165,32
that was me a few hours ago and then i decided not to play myself  ,1,67,16
wouldve been nice  i would def be interested in the sound check for a nice mini concert ,1,88,17
la will definitely be one of the hardest  blackpink will be mia in the pacific northwest  a lot of people from vancouver  seattle  and oregon will try to grab either la or chi tickets  ,1,185,34
thanks  did not know this,1,25,5
i don t know of any k pop concerts  in north america  that have had openers  unless it was a multi headliner show ,1,114,20
i don t believe stubhub is an official site for buying tickets when they are first release  as it is a re selling site  people are just posting tickets  but they won t be available until after they start going on sale on ticketmaster and axs  basically they are scalpers and buy the tickets at face value  but sell them at higher prices to make money  so if you can buy tickets  wednesday at 4pm pst  i would and only result to stubhub if the tickets that you wanted are gone  hope this made sense ,1,498,92
do you know the capacity of the london venue  ,1,46,9
that and you also have to think of how early you have to get there to get a good spot to stand in  whereas seating is assigned,1,126,27
yea that s the other thing  i don t like being squished up against others lol,1,77,14
i think korea,1,13,3
or standing with a thousand people at your back  so many concerts here have floor seats  i really was hoping for the same    ,1,125,24
i m still trying to decide if i want to stand or not  \,1,55,13
so where can i buy this,1,23,6
agreed lol  i would have splashed out the  600 cad for the perks    i just didn t want to stand   ,1,98,20
i went and checked ticketmaster for the la concert and i noticed there s 2 ticket options  general public and official premium  i ve googled it and still can t really understand fully what official premium is  does anyone know the difference  ,1,243,39
where did you see ticket pricing for specific seats ,1,52,9
what is the merchandise besides the landyard   amp  x200b  also i thought soundcheck got merch lanyard too  so it s only vip  ,1,126,19
guys  i don t know how much longer i can do this  she is so gorgeous,1,68,15
nation s it girl seriously,1,26,4
bruh  some of us be older and cant rage no mo like that,1,55,13
when i bought tickets for ariana grande in chicago through ticketmaster  this was my receipt  [  there is an  order processing fee   a  service fee  and a  tax   theses fees will varies by city  venue and even artist  the total of these fees for 1 ticket was  27 07  i m not sure about a 20  tax but i would have an extra  30 40 dollars on hand just in case  i hope this helps you  good luck   lt 3,1,398,76

jennie was definitely born to be on the cover of magazines  beautiful as always    ,1,83,15
what are the means by which i can aquire a cosmo from korea    jennie looking beautiful as always    ,1,101,20
i hope so  that would be such a scam for us europeans   ,1,56,13
service fee  set by the people selling the tickets  i believe it is around 20  of the face value price  order processing fee  probably around  10 15 delivery fee  if applicable facility fee  if applicable  probably around  5 10 taxes  usually included in face value  sometimes can be added in the end,1,300,50
can she get any more beautiful  she s so gorgeous  ,1,51,9
anyone know if they will have an opener ,1,40,8
so  just so you know  ticketmaster and axs don t have the best of reputation when it comes to handling large amounts of traffic all at once and axs is especially rated terribly in that regards  some things to consider    multiple devices  have the ticketing website open on multiple tabs  but not so many that it impacts your computer s performance  and as many computers  laptops and phones tablets  etc you have  ticketmaster will occasionally prevent you from using their website from specific devices  probably to prevent bots  so you ll have to switch to another device quickly  axs just makes you use a recaptcha system to prevent bots so if you refresh multiple times be prepared for that to slow you down eventually    queuing  both sites will allow you to enter a queue 30min before the saletime  just to be safe  i d recommend just having the site open at least an hour or more before the sale time and check periodically  if i remember correctly  while ticketmaster will enter you automatically  i could be wrong   axs requires you to click a button  the sooner you enter the queue the better  once you re in the queue  do not refresh the page  it ll automatically take you to the page when it s time  if you refresh you may lose your place    account  make sure you have an account with a credit card saved on the account  make sure you are logged in  this way you don t have to enter information while you are buying  it also helps to have a notepad word doc open with all of your information already typed if you want to copy and paste    refresh  don t be afraid to try over and over  i ve heard stories of people trying for better tickets  continually refreshing for 8 hours after tickets went on sale  good luck ,1,1729,305
do you guys think that vip would be a fansign ,1,46,10
1  i m sure it will be difficult  but not impossible  just be patient and calm  if it keeps telling you there s nothing left just give it a minute and don t freak out  people are adding and removing tickets from their carts  tip  if you want ga  search for  best available  that way if ga doesn t come up  you know there are none available at the moment  and you can decide if you would take the next best available seats it gives you  2  for la  they will be sold on ticketmaster  tip  use the app instead of the website as there will be less traffic and it ll move a little quicker  3  give yourself about 15 minutes before on sale date to be situated and set up that way when they are on sale you can just click and go  tip  there may be a queue depending on how many people are trying to get tickets  i ve only seen this a couple of times  if there is it may let you queue early  just check every so often before the on sale date  if there is a queue do not exit out after getting in  4  for ticketmaster  i believe the service fee is 20  of the ticket price  so since ga is  198 50  you re looking at about a  40 service fee  then there will be a couple smaller fees such as facility  etc  i would say the final total will be somewhere between  250 300 each  there really is no way around this and is just something you re gonna have to pay  best of luck    i m buying for fort worth tomorrow    ,1,1401,272
it s more fun standing at a bp concert  ,1,40,8
same for amsterdam  although black vip was a bit cheaper  470 if i recall correctly   i bought the pink vip  so we might get the ep download as well  since the us was announced after the europe tour ,1,199,38
so you can definitely bring your own light stick if you don t want to it buy from the concert ,1,94,19
is it aa or aaa batteries  most people here seem to say aaa batteries  thanks for the help though   ,1,100,20
i m going to the kl concert so hopefully should be the same version as those at the singapore concert  thanks for the help   ,1,125,24
ok i ll bring some just in case  thanks for the help   ,1,55,12
1  yup agreed  i ll bring some just in case  2  should be 2 aaa batteries as answered by others  thanks for the help   ,1,119,24
yeah logically they should come with batteries  thanks for the help   ,1,70,12
alright thanks for the help   ,1,30,6
i d go seated  i normally always go floor standing but i m considering taking a seat this time around  ,1,103,17
i m considering the same  i usually always go ga floor and dance my way to the front if needed  this has so many moving pieces and there are so many rabid fans  that i think a seat somewhere close is the best choice for this  ,1,226,45
the seating chart on ticketmaster for la concert shows a seated vip section but powerhouse live chart does not  can anyone confirm there will be a seated vip section ,1,166,29
i paid 3x face value for rv so i could get 6th row   pretty sure i overpaid on stubhub  like maybe if i had waited a few days the price would have dropped  but it was very much worth it  i love them even more now   i don t think i can afford stubhub for blackpink so crossing fingers i get in on the initial sale from ticketmaster   ,1,333,67
hope you get the tickets you want  i m going to try my best to get tickets for the hamilton concert as well  ,1,109,22
omg i just spent my money for rv and to go to both the ny and chicago show for perfume  idt they are coming back to the us again    and here i am going to spend my last bit of savings to see my 4 favorite people lol ,1,216,49
thanks so much ,1,15,3
the ticketmaster venue layout isn t an accurate representation of the ticket sections  powerhouse provides a better layout [powerhouse firstontario centre layout for bp concert]   it s at the bottom of the page  ,1,212,31
karl lagerfeld has died  perhaps jennie may say something about him ,1,68,11
nobody can beat jennie when it comes to girl crush  she can absolutely slay with those eyes  ,1,93,17
in korea that s like the secret sauce to become a famous female idol if you have those qualities  probably why bp is so loved b c most of the members are like that ,1,164,32
1  how hard will it be to purchase these tickets  i think la will be the hardest to get tickets b c it has the largest korean community in the us  but then the forum has a capacity of  17 k so you might have time to purchase  2  [ticketmaster]   and [axs]   are the official tickets sellers  3  early as you can   d i think london sold out in like 15mins but it depends on the city and demand  i think la will be very much in demand  4  not sure  ,1,447,89
so in germany we had to pay 535 euros for the black vip and we did not even get an ep    wow    as much as i love bp    this is very sad for us living in germany   ,1,164,37
we weren t sure whether it was an option or that it was automatically included with every ticket ,1,97,17
for those that couldn t get the ticket  try get a job at st to review the concert  get paid too  cause that newsworthy  ,1,120,23
i thought we knew this already ,1,31,6
same here fam,1,13,3
jennie s duality is no joke  one moment she ll give you this fierce look  the next she ll look like a complete baby  ,1,117,21
that wording for question  2 about the sound check tickets is so bad   amp  x200b  ga ticket with sound check   then goes on to say  have a chance to attend sound check     so do they get it or not  lmao  amp  x200b  have fun on the floor y all  im gonna sit down in p1 forreal though ,1,285,52
yes this is official merch designs  you can confirm this by seeing it on yg s website ,1,86,15
that s a good question  b c there will be competition from other ppl posting resale tickets which will drive the price down  treat it as like a presale for impulsive buyers that don t care about the price of the tickets  they re hoping ppl like these buy them ,1,260,46
ah ok  my question is why list them now tho  why not wait until they actually buy the ticket to list the ticket ,1,112,23
ahh so it s like a placeholder for the resellers then when tickets actually go on sale and they get their tickets they just upload them ,1,136,25
stubhub is like the ebay of ticket purchases and act as a middleman  they are not a scam site  the seller needs to enter their credit card   and will get charged if they re are any problems with the tickets  in case the tickets are fake stubhub will try to get replacement or give you your money back  what is probably happening is scalpers are listing them at absurd prices ahead of time and plan on buying the tickets when it eventually goes on sale and give it to you ,1,471,90
they re pretty much a scam  they buy a bunch of tickets and resell them at double the value  if you do buy from them you will get an actual ticket in whatever section you purchase and will give you the seat number later after tickets actually go on sale  all in all try not to buy tickets until the tickets actually go on sale ,1,327,64
sometimes i think it can be bots setup to automatically create fake ticket listings ,1,84,14
don t tell me i m the only who thought she was pregnant for a moment on the left photo    ,1,90,18
don t worry i m not i was just confused  do scammers actually do that  don t the buyers know that the tickets aren t even on sale yet ,1,134,25
[made a large aspect ratio wallpaper of this picture]   ,1,56,9
those are fake and scams  pls don t buy them ,1,45,9
well said  in particular the part talking about the lack of music,1,65,12
this would be an awesome idea    ,1,33,6
not sure what the premium and blink package mean tbh  anyone else know  ,1,72,13
i believe the 3 colours just correspond to separate the seating levels and not the pricing tiers  when tickets go on sale the seats will be partitioned off accordingly by price  it wouldn t make sense for section 209 or 229 for example to be the same price as the other yellow sections b c of it s bad viewing angle ,1,316,58
i think the closer you are the higher the prices with the ga floor in two parts and the vip tickets,1,99,21
yass  i would lose my shit if that happens  but tbh  deep inside  i want a cl dara collab with any bp members  to end all of this fuzz about them  ,1,147,30
jiyong and ros  had a collab before  when rosie was still a trainee so i m hoping they ll collab again soon  but i would very much like for taeyang and rosie to collab  the two powerful main vocals  ,1,199,37
yeah  no offense to stay  but stay is only appreciated within the fandom but with the gp it wasn t as successful  so i really hope not  i still want rosie to have that yg sound maybe like taeyang s ringa linga  maybe start there and then the mellow songs can come after  ,1,271,49
for sure  but which prices in the posting apply to which seats in the ticketmaster picture  ,1,92,16
interesting note the upcoming ep will be included with every ticket purchase ,1,77,12
i think it has something to do with vip tickets  that shlould also be the reason for those high prices of some tickets ,1,119,23
na tour [faq]  ,1,15,3
yeah i can t wait ,1,18,4
if you wanna be double sure contact axs tomorrow   that way they can fix the page if so  i m doing blink package for fort worth too    gonna be awesome,1,151,29
ohhh  i thought there s a statement by yg stating a collab with them  that would be ideal tho  taeyang mentioned in the past he likes ros  s voice  same as with jiyong  ,1,169,31
alrighty thx  yeah i was thinking that i should email them ,1,59,11
are there pictures of the other girls too or have they not come out yet ,1,72,15
sweet  ty  i just don t want it to be at 6pm because i m busy at that time  so i m just making sure ,1,100,22
i really hope it s not like stay  seungri saying that 1 2 3 was originally for ros  has given me hope though because it s more upbeat  it also would be unfair to have ros  do a sad slow song for her solo debut because they generally don t do as well ,1,250,48
the tickets go on sale at local time for all venues  this we know  i m not sure about that special blink package  you might want to email to clarify  though  4pm pst is 6 pm cst which is 2 hours after the tickets go on sale  but that might just be a typo ,1,255,53
does anyone know how long the concert usually lasts  aka when to expect to leave the venue also  when should you arrive at the venue to be early  and is there any special events  merchandise  fanmeet etc   thanks for the help    ,1,229,42
it ll be 4pm local time  so cst,1,31,7
my mom,1,6,2
for real  sometimes i wonder what will happen if they released aiiyl after dddd   maybe love scenario level of popularity  we ll never know  but i like thinking about it haha ,1,175,30

those in singapore came with the batteries  and the lightstick requires 2 aaa batteries  ,1,89,14
no  it s because gd  amp  taeyang will be discharged from the military on nov  daesung too  i think  ,1,101,18
ordered the lightstick via the amazon and it came with batteries as well  uses 2 aa batteries ,1,94,17
love it  i didn t know jisoo had that look in her lolol,1,55,12
march is already going to be stacked in terms of competition  you ve got mamamoo  txt  epik high  stray kids  wjsn  etc  let s see how much blackpink has grown in popularity in korea since their last comeback  they really only hit it big in korea in 2018  they were pretty popular in kr in 2017  but they skyrocketed from like a 55 85 once square up released  i m really curious as to what their songs are going to sound like  i was completely clueless as to what concept they could go for in square up  and if they ll go for a double title track mvs or stick with the one title with a secondary title track without a mv  judging from their schedule it looks like they won t be attending any of the university music festivals which happen in may  they do have a 10 day gap in between the 8th and the 18th  so maybe we ll see them in kr for a university music festival  ,1,869,164
is soundcheck early entry  i read somewhere that they have people leave after soundcheck and then start the actual entry process ,1,129,21
they just need a full album for world domination,1,48,9
yaaaasssss queens,1,17,2
we ll revisit this topic in a couple of days  and see who scored tickets and whatnot  ,1,86,17
their best  imo ,1,16,3
wait  what gd taeyang collab  ,1,30,4
just some totally random thoughts because i talked with some other user about it  i really hope that ros  will be featured on iu s next full album  back when iu said she would like to collab with ros  i sincerely hope that their labels talked about it  that was at the time of her last album so there really wasn t any time for that collab to materialize since then  maybe it happened though for a new record  pls pls pls  with bigbang coming back from military this year i also hope that gd will write some songs for bp  i love teddy s songs but some gd material would be dope as well  maybe even some collabs between bigbang and bp members in the future  arguably yg s two biggest groups  it would break the internet and just imagine the digital performance in korea when bigbang and blackpink had something up their sleeves  i also wonder how well this upcoming comeback will do  i don t extremely care for all these youtube records in a vacuum  but it definitely gives some publicity because there are articles about it  blackpink had around 7m subscribers before their dddd comeback and now we are at almost three times that  so we know it will be huge  but how huge exactly  i also did some research about blackpink s tour attendees and assuming they sell out  or close enough for it to not matter  they will be the 3rd gen girlgroup with the most sold tickets overall period   and realistically they will still add at least one stop in australia  pretty awesome if you ask me  o other than that  hoping for some comeback confirmation soonish  hoping that blackpink diaries will be made for every stop they have in their worldtour and just hoping that 2019 will be bp s year    ,1,1684,303
dang shipping to canada is  31 lol  pretty sure that s in usd too  i went to a hot topic in toronto last week and they said items may be subject to duties when shipped to canada  the shirts they sold in stores were  37 99 cad before tax at the time ,1,249,49
yeah they are  hot topic has been selling k pop shirts for a while  ,1,68,13
gd writing for bp is a real possibility i think and it would be totally amazing  i just thought there were rumors about yg family concerts happening again with ikon  winner and blackpink  i guess that s not happening after all  d,1,229,41
i found [this]   clip taken from bp diaries ep  1 where jisoo seemed to be annoyed with lisa lmffaaaooooo she looks so intimidating  i m highkey attracted to pissed jisoo   ,1,173,29
don t know if this was posted previously  but they now have placeholders for standard  premium  vip  and album bundle ticket packages   ,1,136,21
that s different  backpacks are not allowed fanny packs might be allowed ,1,73,11
they wouldn t even allow like a small fannypack  ,1,49,8
whats the first song ,1,21,4
i don t think yg family concerts will happen again because of the backlash from the gd x dara non fans lol  but i m really hoping that for the next cb of bp  gd will be involved in their album  ,1,194,38
blackpink x bigbang collabs would be insane  yg s biggest groups doing something together would break the internet really  weren t there rumors of yg family concerts anyway ,1,173,26
a lot of people want rosie s solo to be more like stay   but i m afraid that would be bad for a solo debut    given that stay didn t chart as high as all their other songs   i m hoping more of a forever young type of vibe   anyways for the gd taeyang collab  i m hoping gd x jennie will happen again  black was such a good song  taeyang x ros  will be a dream come true  too  nov 2019 can t come fast enough  ,1,409,81
ill just piggyback that comment because i work in an arena  they won t let you in with a camelbak  mainly because 1  most of them have just eliminated backpacks of any kind following the explosion at an ariana grande concert in the uk  and 2  because they don t want you to bring your alcohol into the place to not be disruptive and also to buy theirs  ,1,353,66
for any blinks looking for a group  me and some other blinks have created a discord specifically for the show here in newark  if you have any interest in meeting up  or just wanna chat with the tri state blinks  be sure to join   ,1,230,43
i think i m gonna have to cop some tonight thanks ,1,50,10
the pink one def is  they sell it on yg s website  and even the girls have worn it in their concert  thanks op  just bought one    ,1,131,27
not sure  try it and see ,1,25,6
it s scalpers putting tickets up for sale early  because they do this for a living and use bots and such to get guaranteed tickets  notice the horrendous prices like ga for over  600  this is the perfect example of everything wrong with the ticket business ,1,257,45
we should do an la bro gc  ,1,27,7
it s available now on stubhub  don t know how they have it when other places don t go on sale until the 20th though ,1,116,22
i ordered two from yg s online store and my boyfriend ordered one from g market and they all came with batteries in the box  however i d still bring my own set in case they re not selling the boxed version  ,1,207,39
i feel like it is  my only reasoning is that the size label on the shirt has the yg logo,1,88,20
awesome  hopefully  i get to interact with jennie  ,1,51,8
thanks for this info  ^_^,1,25,5
march is coming soon    ,1,24,4
silly question  maybe  is this considered official merchandise ,1,63,8
is this for canada as well  ,1,28,6
notable quotes that summarize the article   gt  jennie  jisoo  lisa and rose   were exuberant and charming onstage    gt  their energy was infectious enough for a casual listener like me to feel like bobbing along to the music    gt     the group and the individual members need more original songs that are tailor made for them to establish a strong musical identity   ,1,370,57
tickets for la seem to be available on stubhub ,1,47,9
you won t be able to camp out  they call you in via ticket queue number so it s best to just come one hour early ,1,113,24
i might be going now if the price range is correct from what was posted  maybe p3 seats  i don t know if i can afford better than that ,1,135,28
thank you  that works   ,1,24,5
lmao  hot topic undercutting yg prices  some of the sizes are actually out of stock on yg s shop and ebay too  funny ,1,117,22
2 20 10am pst,1,13,2
lol i live in the midwest  but flying to la  using bp as an excuse even though chicago would be better financially ,1,115,22
lmao  yeah i imagine i m going to look pretty out of place i m pretty sure i do not look like someone who would be into kpop  i also agree though i figured i don t know if bp will ever come back to the us if they do awesome if not i don t want to regret not doing vip ,1,268,58
i m shooting for vip seats too  i view this as a once in a lifetime thing and i m not going to skimp now ,1,105,23
wait a second  there s another 6 foot plus dude from az going to see blackpink in la  i guess i m not alone after all  i m likely driving and will be dragging my brother in law who loves live music but has never heard of blackpink to the concert ,1,246,46
this is probably a dumb question   but are the ga seats standing only ,1,70,14
seriously  jennie is tying her shoe on stage  i love it ,1,56,11
you just called her a lazy brat  despite working for years to debut and get to where she is  she definitely deserves what she has  no amount of favoritism can get you to where she is now  you re a definitely a hater that is pressed because his bias is not getting what jennie is getting  don t worry all the girls will have their fair share  stop being bitter and learn to love all the girls or at least to respect the girls  instead of talking shit about one member on a black pink reddit  ,1,491,94
i m done arguing with you  my only point is that she doesn t have the best work ethic  you re just putting words in my mouth lmao i m done talking to you  jennie does not work the hardest  period ,1,196,37
favoritism  no favoritism can get you the success and the popularity that she has  you literally sound like a hater  brands don t ask for jennie to be their model if she is not established with a huge popularity  you can t be happy for her when she gets something  are you seriously a blink ,1,291,53
nope  it just shows how spoiled she is and how much favoritism from the company she receives  i m not pressed lmao,1,114,21
yet she still getting those opportunities  stay pressed  all of the girls worked hard to get to where they are today  especially jennie  ,1,137,23
two concerts  [i have to laugh]   my point is that she doesn t have the best work ethic  that s all i m trying to say lmao ,1,123,24
jennie worked and suffered the most out of black pink members during trainee years  i bet you re pressed cuz she is getting all of those opportunities despite the lazy video  all those performances throughout her career and you judged her work ethic in a couple of performances in a concert and lotte concert  you re still painting her as lazy despite all the great performances that she gave recently  what a biased fake blink ,1,428,73
1  in us  vip tickets are the only ones that get early entry  they include soundcheck  but you leave after soundcheck and then the early entry lets you in before the actual show begins   2  most stadiums venues it s a no no  but check the website of your venue just in case ,1,274,50
nah lol just helping u see the truth   ,1,39,9
oh you re definitely one them  an akgae i bet lol,1,49,10
i bought one at the show in bangkok  the merch line was weird  it was like a long row of tables where you ordered at one end and they gave u like a list where u checked off what u wanted  and then you move down to the next person and pay them  and then the next person opened the light stick and then the next person put batteries in it  i ve never seen a merch line like that in the us but i can t imagine they would sell u a lightstick and not give u batteties to use it ,1,473,100
probably going vip if i can get one this will be my first concert in years so i m splurging a bit haha  ,1,104,22
oh that s nice and 5 5 hour drive from phx to la is a pain but i m driving with 4 people  i m not trying to buy 4 plane tickets lol what tickets are you trying to get  ,1,168,36
1  i m not sure about this answer  wouldn t be bad to be safe  2  i have a lightstick at home  if you re willing to wait 5 hours from my comment i can comment again with the specifications if no one answers to you  ,1,215,43
 160 round trip but i went with the super cheap seats but one thing is for sure as a 6 foot tall male i will not be enjoying the 1 hour and 30 minutes on that plane at all  ,1,173,39
you re flying  i m driving there lol how much is your plane ticket ,1,67,12
i ordered my official lightstick online and it didn t come with batteries  it required two aaa batteries of my own ,1,115,20
i m fine with this ,1,19,4
this is very relieving to hear  i seen bts at prudential center in newark last year and was scared to even stand because the seats were so steep  it really took away from the experience  i m aiming for good seats for bp  but i will take any seat lol  are they really high up at infinite energy ,1,294,57
wow  jisoo is dazzling ,1,23,4
only she could pull off polka dots like that ,1,45,9
jisooooooooooooooooo           she finally posted hong kong s photo     i am so happy\ \  ,1,90,12
honestly what s a bias anymore  ,1,32,6
didn t the bp members say once that rose s hair is basically indestructible and that s why she can color her hair so many times  i do like her testing out lots of different colors and styles ,1,191,35
  caption    [\ film]   [  source  ]  ,1,38,3

jennie could be the visual on any kpop gg  she s so damn gorgeous  ,1,67,13
he s no different from michael caine  jason momoa  jennifer lawrence  bill murray  and others who are very good actors with zero range  if you put them in roles that match their one character type  they shine  you try to put them in something else  like shakespeare  it will be laughably bad  goldblum is perfect in jurassic park  independence day  and thor  if spaced out like that  he s great  but it is definitely easy to too much of him if he shows up multiple times a year or even once a year   amp  x200b  based on the youtube title  i expected to see a lot of bp but i think they were only on screen or heard their music for about 10 seconds  it s a shame they filmed multiple episodes of colbert that night or they might have had time to interview bp  hopefully with the album drop and the na tour  we will get many north american interviews soon  it would also be great to see them back on idol room  kb  and other korean variety shows promoting as well  unlike goldblum  you can never have too much blackpink ,1,1019,188
lazy videos  there are several ,1,31,5
this and her baby pink ish hair is my favourite for ros   wishing that she d dye her hair with that really pretty soft pink again bc she looked so good in it,1,157,31
damn  all these moonshot pics looking good ,1,43,7
seriously her beauty is so unique  ,1,35,6
oh you re talking about the lazy video that was made by bts fan  two half assed performances does not define her career  blinks should know that better than anyone ,1,164,29
many photo shoots for jennie these days  very good ,1,51,9

stop jennie kim i have my exams coming ,1,39,8
i know the more extreme colors can do damage to their hair  so i m hoping this is an easy color for her to maintain  ,1,117,24
personally i think this hair color reallyyy shows off her skin skin tone  so i totally agree ,1,93,16
second this  mainly because of her smile  it s basically this emoji    ,1,71,13
what do you get from the vip package   amp  x200b ,1,50,9
yes thank you    i agree  and his character is always insufferable  ,1,68,12
oh  they went to both stages  for the 3 songs they re just going around waving to blinks and having fun  ,1,105,20
you mentioned that in the sound check  they performed 3 songs  do you know where did they perform it  is it in stage a or stage b or is it somewhere else  ,1,155,33

i bet lisa likes tacos too   ,1,29,7
i think this is my favorite hair color for ros      at least until she changes it  then that might be my new favorite  haha,1,123,24
i only sit close at concerts  within the first 10 rows  otherwise i don t bother going  so that s usually the price range i m looking at  i ain t getting a close seat for 70 bucks lol,1,183,35
that last pic is one of my favorite jennie pictures ever,1,56,11
jeff goldblum looks great for his age but i m going to eff the ineffable  he s a terrible actor  he s the exact same person in every fucking movie  he s the white morgan freeman  ,1,179,32
rather than comment on how pretty lisa is  i m just going to say i really like tacos,1,84,17
nope people in the community tend to sell cheap near the day of just gotta know where  bought a 150  ticket for 70  last year,1,125,24
wow  these are really good photos  thank you for sharing   curly haired jisoo is such a dream  ,1,95,17

her work ethic is amazing  she trained the longest in bp  and everything she got is due her hard work  ,1,103,20
lisa makes everyone fall in love   ,1,35,7
rain is the guest on knowing bros this week  getting ready to watch it  ,1,72,14
i have no idea how quickly these will go  la has a large korean american population  i think the largest in the us  so i m sure there will be competition  for things like this in the past i ve teamed up with people and whoever gets into the queue just buys as many as they can and then we split it up and refund the buyer  i m going to try to get as close as possible towards the front of the stage  i m finding that the vip packages don t include a meet and greet so i ll probably pass on that  if i do get tickets  and if there s enough interest  i m thinking about organizing a meetup for blinks before the concert  it s on a wednesday and not everyone is local  so it might be difficult  but i ll try to figure that out once i score some tickets ,1,750,146
honestly  how easy tough do you think it s going to be to get tickets  also  where does everybody plan on sitting standing ,1,123,20
hey  so i don t know where else to post this  but if anyone knows anyone that wants to buy a ticket for the london date  i have one going  it s in n11 and i m selling it for  97 50 which is face value plus the original axs fees  a bunch of friends  and friends of friends  all tried to get tickets and we ended up getting a couple too many  if this isn t the right place to post this  please let me known  and or if there is somewhere better to post it  i ll sell it on a ticket site otherwise  but just wanted to make sure there weren t any blinks here who couldn t get a ticket  one of the others has a standing ticket and a vip one  she s not on reddit  but i can ask her if anyone wants one of those ,1,704,142
they were shipped to me this week and unfortunately there was nothing else in the envelope besides the 3 tickets  i don t live near germany so i understand why the fee is higher  but it s still a lot   ,1,202,38
lisa has the most sweg,1,22,5
i live in la  i will be spamming f5 on my computer at work ,1,59,14
since the set list for their tour would probably still be the same  then they will have another concert next year with a whole different set list including their new songs  but who knows ,1,187,34
found my new wallpaper   ,1,25,5
oh come on,1,10,3
beautiful pictures  ,1,20,3
i would watch the videos but i don t want to ruin the experience for me  like when i go to concert  i don t usually listen to their setlist and watch the things that they do  so i ll just take your word for it  thanks ,1,218,44
do you know where do they perform the 3 songs   do they perform it at stage a or stage b ,1,89,21
i see  that s a good reasoning for it  will definitely take this into consideration  thanks ,1,92,15
i would watch the videos but i don t want to ruin the experience for me  like when i go to concert  i don t usually to their setlist and the things that they do  so i ll just take your word for it  thanks ,1,205,42
goddamn she s fine  ,1,20,3
oh well lisa  the transition from that makes everyone go gay to sweet and sexy girlfriend is real quick and smooth  ,1,116,21
this is my new screen saver,1,27,6
sorry  not online and only if i know the person  i get a little paranoid when people ask how i sneak stuff in  ,1,111,23
teach me your ways,1,18,4
i was,1,5,2
thanks and welcome   ,1,21,4
these are really great   thanks for sharing your photos  ,1,57,11
were you able to bring a dslr at the venue ,1,43,10
hello  just sharing my photo album from the concert a couple of days ago  flickr doesn t exactly embed easily so if you want  [higher quality can be found here]   cheers   ,1,172,31
i m late  don t visit here much  but i would recommend you to be positioned somewhere along  b  especially if you can get there really early  my reason for this is  even if the performances at the main stage are a little far  you do not need to crane your neck or twist and turn your body to look at any of it  ,1,311,62
red lipstick looks so good on her  everything looks so good on her ,1,67,13
she looks incredible  ,1,22,3
and it s cool because other staff were dancing along too    ,1,60,11
so relatable  ,1,14,2
his  feud  with rain is still one of my favs  the dance off    i m a big rain fan and loved how he played along   ,1,114,26
i know  right  i felt so proud    ,1,34,8
2 hours start to finish  my ticket has a soundcheck package so i got to see the girls perform 3 songs in advance with chitchats in between  took around 30 mins  so yeah 2 hrs   30 minutes optional   amp  x200b  i was in the manila concert ,1,239,45
ms barbie doll ,1,15,3
you can check all of the videos  since there are a lot   but anyway you can also opt for b and then stay at the center  i think that s the best place  ,1,151,32
it s a vip package where you get to see blackpink perform 3 songs before the main concert  ,1,91,17
no one has ever said she was mean or a bad person  people commented on her work ethic  ,1,87,18
worth it for the extra angle    ,1,32,7
when i dance to bp  i think i look like lisa  but in reality i look like steven ,1,80,18
ohh  i see  well  i think i should take this into consideration when picking a place to stay at  thank you so much    i really appreciate the help ,1,147,28
they perform some of their songs 2 or 3 times and they each did a cover of an english song and did their so hot cover by wonder girls  there was also a rock band  hired by the girls  to perform and back some of their songs ,1,223,47
i really don t mind them keeping the solo cover performances i hope they change the covers though  concerts to me is getting the chance to see your favourite artist live in person and not so much about the songs as i already listen to their songs daily to death ,1,262,49
right  i m saying they won t necessarily add those songs in addition to the set list and could replace those cover songs in place of the news songs  aka the concert time won t necessarily increase,1,196,34
their cover songs are solos  ,1,29,5
why wouldn t they  that s the whole point of releasing the album before na concerts ,1,84,14
i ll be flying down from spokane for the la show  no friends or family into k pop  as well  just need to talk to my brother who lives in long beach to see if he would want to go  and if not  i m in for a group ,1,210,46
on the asia concert  it was stated at 100 minutes  it should be the same for the na concert unless they include some of the new songs from their upcoming album ,1,160,31
what is sound check entry    ,1,29,5
omg colbert jamming with the finger guns just makes me love him more  ,1,70,13
[he also knows how to sing in korean]    4 00 ,1,46,9
once sound check is done those ppl have to go out and line up again so vip ticket holders get priority for early entry ,1,119,24
bp section starts at 0 45 and colbert danced to d4  haha  i am glad that he was really enjoying the performance ,1,112,21
you get to see them up close after the concert  they ll hang around for 10 mins or so and you can take pictures ,1,112,23
love how the video has a lot of other famous celebrities but they tag blackpink for views  ,1,91,18
well the soundcheck people will go first for the soundcheck package  but after that the staff will ask you to go out again and wait for the main concert  and i m not sure with the b stage  but i would have much rather preferred to be on the a stage because i feel like they stayed there more  except for the encore  ,1,316,62
it was too cute not to share with fellow blinks  ,1,49,10
the [setlist]   is available online  2 vcrs and intermission by the band to allow the girls to change outfits reset the sets  there are also some talking segments after a few songs are performed to let them catch their breath do fanservice ,1,240,40
yeah    key word might lol  and that s assuming they re added to setlist and not replacing their cover songs or whatever,1,120,20
what s taking up some of the 90 mins  are there talking sessions  or in between song videos ,1,92,17
it might be more than 2 hours since they re having a comeback before the us concerts,1,84,16
when lisa sees her dad and says  daddy    my heart melted  ,1,59,11
looks like a good post to me  thanks for sharing ,1,49,10
i 100  agree with you ,1,22,5
seems like a running theme   i m planning on going the bp concert but none of my friends are into kpop   maybe mods should create some sort of sticky thread where bp fans can find each other ,1,191,36
here s the send off they did in jakarta  should give you a good idea of what to expect   ,1,89,17
yup you wave goodbye to them as they leave the venue  here s the one from jakarta   ,1,84,16
after the show you ll get to go  send them off  as they go from the venue to their transportation out  basically just get to wave goodbye and maybee interact with them a little  it s the closest you could get to a meet and greet  here s the send off they did recently in jakarta   ,1,281,52
so we decided to create a discord for midwest blinks but we have a separate chat for basically any other concert stop  so can join us and connect with atlanta blinks through here  [ ,1,182,34
most likely going  insta is  joppai,1,35,6
it s like [this]  ,1,18,3
i m going flying in from arizona ,1,33,6
what is a sendoff ,1,18,4
i never made a post before in this sub so i hope i got it right  i wanted to share this since it features blackpink  i thought it was so cute seeing stephen dancing along backstage  it seems like he s really taking a liking to them and i hope they can meet again  ,1,264,53
i didn t see this shared yet so i had to share it  i hope it s alright  i ve never made a post here before in this sub  i thought it was so cute seeing stephen dancing along while monitoring backstage  seems like he really took a liking to the girls  i hope they get to meet again ,1,281,56
my wife is so beautiful   ,1,26,6
hey  my cousin cia wants to go msg him  christian tejolan on insta hehe,1,71,13
honestly really need some help deciding on what tickets i should get  i am stuck between p1 floor ga or p1 seated  i want a good view but i don t want to stand in line for god knows how long just to get a good spot  reason why i can t pick is because i d like to do the vip package but yet again it s only with standing tickets  does anyone have a good suggestion or opinion on what i should do  it would be greatly appreciated  ,1,429,86
can someone tell me what the  send off  thing means  ,1,53,10
singapore one  it was 7 30 to 9 originally but we got an encore after singing ros  happy birthday so it went to 9 30,1,116,23
which one  how long was it ,1,27,6
post concert depression syndrome,1,32,4
trust me  i went to the blackpink concert with a resold ticket and it s still worth it,1,86,17
what does vip package include ,1,30,5
when bts was in fort worth recently the cheapest ticket was  520,1,64,12
beauty queen and talented singer  we stan a legend ,1,51,9
that is   an interesting analysis of the situation ,1,51,7
we won t be able to tell before we buy though   ,1,48,10
we ll see if their new material pad up the set list ,1,52,11
if it s 2 hours it s worth  what i don t want is a 70 or 80 minute concert at the prices they re asking for lol,1,111,24
 gt  jennie and lisa were at the 7 11 store girls had 3 security guards and a bag carrier lol  one of the dudes was staring down anyone that went near their aisle  pretty crazy  but understandable especially in bangkok,1,218,39
it s most likely to be 2 hours  at least for us dates considering show starts at 8pm and most concerts i ve been to end at 10pm  ,1,129,26
this is so helpful  do you happen to know if vip goes in before soundcheck people or do the vip and soundcheck people all go in at the same time  and was the concert still enjoyable in front of b stage  like how many songs did they perform there vs the main stage ,1,264,53
i agree  it could have been a typo or leaked false rumor  but i remember it wasn t someone just saying it  it was actually some sort of release  i know many kpop shows have talking segments but 3 hours seems like a stretch even if i d love to see them that long ,1,262,52
3 hours is a lot more than 20 songs  i have my doubts about that  unless theres a lot of filler or talking segments  in my experience only the biggest artists have shows that long and theres usually a preshow too  taylor swift was 2 hours but her preshow with camila and charlie xcx made it 3 ,1,293,57
recently it was posted that the european leg is 3 hours compared to around 2 in asia  so it may vary from place to place  i ll see if i can find the post  i m on mobile  sorry  ,1,177,37
oh okay  thanks for the information  it definitely helps a lot   ,1,65,12
idk  if it didn t say anything while buying it  probably not  this was probably a move by interscope to influence their chart position in the us,1,144,26
dancer  rapper  singer  and model      what cant she do ,1,56,10
i just finished watching and i enjoyed blackpink house but i am already liking this so much better  my favorite part was when jennie and lisa were at the 7 11 store and jennie was wanting to try things local s ate  and it was cute seeing lisa s dad there  i m looking forward to the rest of the series ,1,302,57
pretty much yes,1,15,3
we couldn t find anything so we ended up making a new discord server [  ,1,72,14
nah bruv this was near the end of the concert,1,45,10
let s megabus this shit,1,23,4
the prices i saw on those were ridiculous  nose bleeds were more than vip ,1,74,14
you can use a ig downloader like   or   to download the pictures  ,1,66,13
is there an imgur album or something of these pics ,1,51,10
zedd   clarity,1,14,3
absolutely loved it  more please  jisoo s solo  what song is it ,1,64,11
man i am loving this content  has this behind the scenes vibe  showing us how adorable and genuine the girls are  i wonder how often these will release now  once per week ,1,171,32
yeah can someone reiterate what the send off is  and is yg strict when it comes to phones during soundcheck vip perks ,1,118,21
i already miss them sighhh,1,26,5
i was there  it was awesome  great job sg blinks    ,1,52,11
beautiful people alert  ,1,24,3
can someone explain what a send off is  do we just see them leave or ,1,69,14
doea anyone know what the bp send off is for the vip tickets  are there any meet  amp  greet pic opportunities  i would get vip if i could get a pic with them otherwise it doesnt seem worth it to me   ,1,201,42
yeah i think i ll be alone  everyone else has to work  but i ll still try on multiple devices  thank you  ,1,106,20
if you re buying a lot  make sure you have people helping you in the same room  my cousin and i bought for 5 and we had 4 computers out  mine was the only one that got in right away and was able to buy tickets ,1,210,45
just release and yes there is ,1,30,6
love this look so much ,1,23,5
1  after the concert  there will be staff that will ask you to stay for the send off package  i m not sure how the whole process works since i got the soundcheck one  2  well  this one depends on how the whole thing will be managed  as for the asia tour  there was a queue number along with the ticket  your queue number depends on the time of purchase of your ticket  i got  3 for the queue number and i was able to stay at the front then  3  well  i stayed at the letter b  but to be honest  most of their performances were at the main stage    although it s your choice if you still want to watch them at the second stage since there are times that they will perform there  but they performed more on the main stage than the second stage  i m not sure if the set list will change for the na  amp  europe tour since they will have a comeback next month  most probably not  ,1,875,173
that s the estimated date yg gave was mid to late march for the ep ,1,67,14
niki is really good and i recommend her to anyone interested  also check out 88rising  their entire company has great artists ,1,126,21
you have enough for floor ga with soundcheck ,1,45,8
in my opinion  the ticket prices are still quite expensive ,1,59,10
or 10 lol,1,9,3
uhmmm    do europeans get a digital ep copy aswell  ,1,52,9
very happy that they are going to be making this a series because personally i find it very interesting to see behind the scenes footage like this and also because i really liked the vibe that this video had if that makes sense  very down to earth yet professional and fast paced  definitely looking forward to the rest of the episodes and like someone else said  i wonder if they ll make one episode for each city  hmm only time will tell  lookign forward to the rest ,1,469,85
brandon ftw,1,11,2
facebook event pages or maybe city threads will be made i m the sub,1,67,13
first of all  welcome to     d secondly i think that it s just something that the production team threw together for this video so i don t think we ll ever get a full version of the remix sadly ,1,194,37
i love my rapunzel  lisa is so gorgeous i feel like crying  ,1,60,12
hey guys  i m new to this reddit  but i have been a blink since their debut and this video makes me super happy  and please let this be a lead in to the comeback  please  quick question  does anyone know the whistle remix at the beginning  is there a way to find a full audio of it  ,1,283,56
a beautiful woman   and so talented  ahh i love lisa so much     ,1,65,12
i that ,1,7,2
many great videos are releasing these days  very good ,1,54,9
holy shit      ahh i love niki     ,1,35,6
so in love   lt 33,1,18,4
with bp getting really famous worldwide  having jennie on the show can only drive up the rating  ,1,97,17
they look so gooooooooooooood  and it was so natural  it really felt like we were there with them  as they were getting ready for the show  jenshookt as per usual  she is so memeable  same with lisa and her little dances  i loved seeing them rehearse the dance  they all seemed so natural and in their own world  but you can see the work they put out  i also love seeing the behind the scenes on the people working to make sure the concerts are a success  we should all be grateful that they have an amazing team making sure they look and sound their absolute best  ,1,566,107
yooooo   i was just yesterday talking about wanting blackpink house 2 0 and they come out with this  this might be even better  cause is not scripted and they can be a little crazy  i just wish it s as big as blackpink house or even bigger  can you imagine if we get something for coachella as well  i would love to see the preparation the goes into  i just really missed them  being candid and just letting loose  it s been a while  hopefully this is not going to be one per week  i don t know if i would be able to handle it  i need my blackpink fix lol ,1,556,108
chaelisa rise  ,1,15,2
as much as i love them  i probably won t buy the highest tier tickets  seems kinda high when they don t have many songs out yet  but i ll take the risk of them releasing a banger album  and coming back to canada again    ,1,221,43
i have no idea what they re doing or what the hell is going on  but i like it  ,1,79,18
yeah vip price is painful but they re usually reserved for die hard blinks or ppl that are well off that don t even flinch at the price   ,1,138,27
she s indonesian ,1,17,2
if the regular soundcheck tickets will include a lanyard too  the vip sounds kinda worth too  but man  524 50cad  is gonna be painful af  including the plane ticket there     ,1,175,29
where is niki from  imo jackson really stands out in dancing  he has that  swag  charisma style that yg artists portray in their dances,1,135,23
anyone know what s included in the vip blink package  the price  524 50cad   seems crazy  but if i get a chance to meet them  that sounds worth it ,1,147,27
i didn t think i could be more of a fan  this felt so natural and  diary like   i had a grin during the entire video along with a couple of laughs  the maknae line  rose and lisa  was so quirky and funny lol  particularly with their interaction with brandon  jennie getting scared easily again  and i loved her interest into lisa s hometown lifestyles  ,1,353,62
lol at jennie flipping the f  k out when the sound comes on,1,59,12
 my heart goes bounce bounce ,1,29,5
yes send off is for vip only,1,28,7
she can t do this to usss,1,25,6
hoping there s a season 3 renewal  and jennie can fit it in her schedule  ,1,74,14
awww that s so sweet    the cast seemed to have gotten close  ,1,62,12
 gt  ep  1 ooohhhh  really hope they release one of each city           ,1,72,13
thanks that s useful to know  lol   fwiw i m below the average female canadian height but above average for an asian female     part of the reason why i d prefer not to get a standing ticket is that i ll be going with a friend who s not a blink and i don t want them to feel pressured into having to spend as much as me just because i m obsessed  but i ll definitely keep the info about the standing area in mind in case the girls come back in the future  ,1,456,88
i was wondering if they re gonna do this like how they did for jennie s solo  love it ,1,86,17
thanks  this is very helpful   i forgot to indicate my prices were the cad ones for hamilton lol     as a working adult with disposable income and no dependants  i was prepared to pay for vip    just not standing tickets since i ll be with a friend who s not a blink and i don t want to pressure them just so i can get fed  if i was alone    oh i definitely would get the vip    ,1,379,75
is the send off area exclusive to vip ,1,38,8
but i was a stick but i was a stick,1,35,10
hmm sounds like a perfect opportunity  will be on pcs leave from korea around that time ,1,88,16
chaennie and lisoo described in three seconds  7 50 ,1,52,8
too many memes to be made from just this 1 diary  should be entertaining for awhile lol ,1,88,17
jennie being jenshookt and lisa and jisoo doing this   ros  saying she s a stick   ,1,83,15
jennie   6 08 jisoo  amp  lisa   7 40     can t wait to see all the memes blinks are going make rn,1,98,21
unfortunately there isn t a meet and greet  the closest you can get to them is during send off  but you won t be able to touch or get a selfie with them or the likes  ,1,167,33
yas please more content blinks are being spoiled before the comeback  so nice to be released from the blinks  jobless culture for once ,1,135,23
yes omg thats the price i was praying for,1,41,9
that s what happens when the economy is all in on natural resources ,1,68,12
hopefully they wear outfits like the last picture here for coachella  seems like it would fit with the festival scene more than most of their stage outfits ,1,156,27
vip is the standing area close to the stage like the red area [here]   if you come early you can be right in front and height shouldn t be a problem ,1,149,30
as far as i know the sound check option  floor ga  259 50  is just the p1 option but with sound check so i think you get in even earlier in the pit area  p1 ga would be standing w o sound check   198 50   i don t think there s anything more expensive than that unless you choose vip option which includes the former ,1,316,60
thank you  i think i understand how the seats work now ,1,55,11
 scary  scary  ,1,15,2
it s from the welcoming edition ,1,32,5
same  first time buying tickets for myself and a friend and because of the 4 pm sale time  i ll be at work and praying i have no meetings or interruptions    ,1,158,31
any older blinks want to meet up earlier in the day for this  it d be nice to meet people who actually live in the dfw area ,1,124,26
that s the fx for you  pretty consistent without costs at  1 30 cad for every  1 usd   ,1,87,17
so ga p1 is standing   259 50  but without sound check   329 50  right  pardon my ignorance  i m pretty new to concert stuff too  i m not tall and my friend who s accompanying me is not hardcore like me so i wished there were vip privileges for seated tickets    i think i ll go for the p1 seated  ,1,298,55
ah  i see  appreciate the answer ,1,33,6
honestly i think a lot of that will depend on the venue and city producer capability  we had bag size restrictions and bag checks plus metal detection  wand not doorway  but there were multiple stations per gender so there was virtually no queueing time ,1,254,44
people think she s mean   i m not really in the following scene but that s a surprise to hear ,1,94,17
me too  i m still gonna watch this season but it won t be as good without jennie,1,80,16
that is so awesome ,1,19,4
yes  red ga is standing  everything else is seated  good luck ,1,62,10
cool  one more thing  how long did it take you to get into the venue aka how bad were the lines  i m debating whether to get a seat or stand if the wait beforehand isn t too draining  ,1,184,37
ga is standing only but you get to move closer to the girls  if you get in early ,1,81,18
yes  that should be right ,1,26,5
set of welcoming   ,1,19,3
wow the hamilton tickets are so expensive  there is no middle like in the us  i mean i was ready to pay 150  but not 200   in us p2 is at least 150  but in canada p2 is like 200     i guess i have to save up to afford the tickets i want hahaha,1,243,55
huh  huh  huh  lisa  lisa  lisa ,1,32,6
thank you so much for posting the maps  question  so anything that s not ga  in red  has seats right  ,1,102,19
i m kind of new to this  but what is the difference between p1 ga and p1  i know it stands for general admission  but what does it exactly mean  since floor ga is the center area  and p1 is going to be seated  i assume   ,1,221,45
yes but i didn t know if they had the same entry or earlier as the soundcheck ga or not since technically the vip package would be going in for the same thing,1,158,32
honestly  looking at all these breaks my heart t t,1,50,9
now that the prices are out i m trying to decide between the vip package and the soundcheck ga  the latter is  150 cheaper but if the vip package goes in before them then i consider it worth it   plus the send off and laminate and whatever else,1,244,47
we do have the prices pinned in our discord  they should be available on the website too now though ,1,100,19
just updated the link  hopefully this works     ,1,48,8
hi  is the discord channel closed or set to private  just tried to join and couldn t ,1,85,16
i have the same issue with you  do you think reg ga will still be worth considering all the vips will take the good spots  ,1,123,25
it says vip goes in at early entry,1,34,8
wyatt is my spirit animal ,1,26,5
only  400 for vip   oh work bitch,1,33,7
oh man  jackson is one of my favorite kpop guys out there  ,1,59,12
i m buying for a group  i ve never bought tickets at release so i m so nervous  ,1,80,15
haha totally forgot that jackson is having a collab with 88rising,1,65,11
everyone is on the same boat   ,1,31,7
thanks  now decisions    decisions    ,1,38,4
they didn t post photos of their hong kong show   ,1,50,10
it s also available on the powerhouse fb page and their twitter account ,1,72,12
usually 2 3hr before concert start  you ll get that information ahead of time ,1,78,12
does anybody know what time the soundcheck usually starts  i m so for it  but concert is on a wed and i have work prior to the concert ,1,135,27
show looks expensive with the stage  lighting  live band  pyrotechnics  and extra dancers  it makes sense for bp to go all out as they ve never done anything low key  they re having a comeback in march so the setlist will be bigger  should be a treat for us eu concert goers ,1,275,49
they usually do  i got tickets to rise against in toronto ad their album came with the ticket  and in any case  i m pretty sure  don t remember the schedule  hamilton is the only canadian stop so i d imagine that it is ,1,219,41
i hope their upcoming comeback will be able to sell it out  in case they don t initially ,1,89,17
i ll just copy paste my comment from  [seating maps]   if you need them  i saw them last night here in singapore  they put on a very good show  live band was rocking awesome and the stage effects pyrotechnics were over the top  must ve cost a mint to produce  hence the teamup with kia and obligatory f amp f tokyo drift style vcr for the kia stinger in the middle of the show  did they repeat songs  yes  but only a reprise of dddd at the encore  setlist [here]    no changes from the manila show  did they sing rap live  yes  pretty much  they used handheld mikes instead of the boom mouthpieces  except for jennie s solo   don t know if i have enough words thoughts to warrant a concert report though  but feel free to ask if you want more feedback ,1,752,132
man blinks are getting well fed to use some kpop slang here  and i am loving it  hopefully it s somewhat long  o,1,112,22
  blackpink diaries just announced    the timing,1,48,7
ahahahah jackson ,1,17,2
i m so worried i won t get vip tickets   ,1,41,9
email from powerhouse live,1,26,4
tried to make it sound cheap lol,1,32,7
it s not almost 400 haha,1,24,5
where is this from    teaser for new album  new photoshoot  cf  and most importantly she looks so seductive and gorgeous ,1,121,20
that s hot,1,10,2
lmao a wild jackson appears ,1,28,5
[prices]   just came for na tour,1,32,6
what  source  ,1,14,2
didnt expect that ending,1,24,4
she s an angel from above  so beautiful ,1,40,7
damnnn those vip tickets cost    [ticket prices for na tour]  ,1,62,10
niki is an artist from 88rising that lisa has mentioned 2 times with an [ig story]   and using one of her songs in [lili film  3]  ,1,131,26
its about 400 dollars   ,1,24,5
omg jisoo singing clarity  ,1,27,5
ya  to me  ros  is stable across all situation  jennie is like two ends of the spectrum  so she could either be very confident and fierce or very shy and cute  lisa just needs to feel more relaxed then she ll be perfectly fine  and jisoo is fine with stuff in korean but when it s english she gets shy not confident ,1,316,59
ros  usually is the more introverted group member which simply brings her less attention on a lot of occasions  but in general all the girls have their fair share of love i would say even if jennie and lisa seem to have a wider appeal in the west  so compared to other groups which have way more members blackpink really stands out in its equal fan spread tbh  which is great and also something which will help in the west  with that being said  i was rather happy to see that ros  had her moments during these interviews on gma and strahan and sara and i am already excited for the us promotions during their tour  and her solo ofc ,1,633,120
i m hoping to go   i live in ny outside of buffalo  ,1,52,11
underrated  really  i don t mess around with fan groups for obvious reasons but when i watch the videos  she s the one that always stands out imo ,1,146,26
i don t think being born in korea was the problem  she was just visibly nervous and went blank at times  her english is fine if you watch her other interviews ,1,159,30
 gt  it surprises me that jennie isn t really that great at expressing herself in english  but she does her best  she was nervous that s all being on us national tv  watch her other english interviews [here]   [here]   and [here]   she does fine and is usually the point person for the interviews  i think everyone was shocked that rosie was that confident and took so much control ,1,382,66
i love that artwork of jennie as princess jasmine  kuma looks extra cute in it too  someone let me know if that person has an instagram or anything like that   would love to see more  ,1,184,34
it has to do with yg not giving her solo promotions such as cf s and variety shows on top of not having a viral moment like lisa and jennie have had  if yg plays their cards right during her solo  that would definitely be her time to shine ,1,240,48
second this  her cheers for the singapore concert is the least but is okay  my forever bias     ,1,96,18
ros  is my forever bias  her voice is incredible and her personality is so adorable     and her dancing is underrated as well  i think her and jisoo are both underrated in a lot of ways  hopefully once they get their solos  theyll be able to shine and show off more of their talents ,1,283,54
so genuine,1,10,2
oh my god  i swear she gets even more beautiful every time i see a picture of her  ,1,83,18
its been awhile since she changed her hair color   love it   amp  x200b ,1,72,12
i couldn t agree more  ,1,23,4
jisoo is even more underrated   ,1,32,6
yo i am fucking dead right now ,1,31,7
i just like to think that blackpink is really well balanced in terms of how the group was brought together  their teamwork really shows on stage and off stage  there s something for every fan out there when you re a fan of these four girls  it s sad that not everyone appreciates every member  but those of us who do get a little bit of everything from the four  ,1,363,65
guys i want to clarify a few things because of what i ve seen people commenting  i m sure a lot of you know this already  but for those who are doubting this website  its purpose  etc   1  the main reason why i posted this was for assurance to blinks that new blackpink music was coming soon 2  concert tours use this approach quite often in order to  sell  more albums  as the price of the album will be worked into the ticket  and every purchase will go towards sales for charts  etc  it s just a business tactic  3  this isn t to say there will be numerous choices for tickets for one show  or using one over the other  there will be one way of purchasing tickets for this show  either through ticketmaster or axs  depending on the venue  4  going off that  it is assumed this will be available for both services  whether or not there will be an option to include the album or not  i don t know  if there is an option  there will be a choice to add it when selecting your ticket  think the  collectors ticket  option some shows have  it s a  10 upcharge you can add  don t freak out or question the authenticity of axs  just go about your normal ticket purchasing ways and be happy we will be getting new music soon    ,1,1222,228
jisoo is just too much for me ,1,30,7
i think we have to keep in mind that jennie was born in korea she only studied english as a foreign exchange student  so it s quite understandable for her to be nervous when speaking in english  ,1,195,35
yeah  ros  practically is the voice for the group outside of korea apart from thailand  she s also quite the vocal queen  so why she didn t get the first solo is ahead scratcher to me  it surprises me that jennie isn t really that great at expressing herself in english  but she does her best  lisa and jisoo are understandably similar to most idols when it comes to communicating outside korea  this past week seeing her talking really surprised me in a good way  ,1,465,82
des pa cito,1,11,3
 gt concert tours do this all the time  huh  til,1,48,8
axs is a legitimate ticket service used by several venues  just like ticketmaster  ticketfly  eventbrite  etc  its use it just dependent on the venue or tour  ,1,159,26
hmm i wouldn t say underrated  but i guess she  along with jisoo  are the lesser known members of the group internationally  however  she s got some truly loyal fans out there   ot4 will always stand out during concerts  always  no matter who your bias is  you will always cheer for ot4  plus her solo s coming after their mar apr cb so i m hoping she ll be more internationally recognized  oh and of course the american   europe tours i think she ll truly shine because she s just  so  witty and nice and comfortable in interviews  ,1,533,92
she is the unsung hero of blackpink  after watching her in the west is solidified it for me  they would not be able to function without her ,1,140,27
concert tours do this all the time  it s just a way of driving up sales  the cost of the album will already be worked into the price of the ticket  in my experience  there hasn t been an option to choose with or without it  it either came with it or didn t  idk how this will be  it s nothing to freak out or worry over  i was just posting this as assurance new blackpink music was indeed coming ,1,396,77
any news on eu tickets ,1,23,5
she s a christian  shouldn t be saying that  ,1,45,8
great write up    i can totally relate to the higher pitch voice when speaking in a language one is not as confident in  i ve never thought about it from a preemptive induction of sympathy pov though so i found that rather interesting  from personal experience i speak in a higher pitch than english in an attempt to sound more polite and friendly lol  really glad that rosie has an opportunity to shine  her accent  phew  ,1,423,76
the hamilton show is through ticketmaster  wonder if ticketmaster will have this bundle   ,1,90,14
use this company at your own risk  trustpilot score of 1  lots of reviews saying they got ripped off ,1,101,19
she is such a sweetheart  i hate the greater kpop community  ,1,61,11
wonder what their ticket allocation is ,1,39,6
so i m imagining that the ticket price will be a bit more expensive then  or maybe there are two versions of it   i don t know   maybe i m just wierd  it sounds too good to be true what s the catch   gt   lt  actually now that i think about it  the people who attend the concert will probably buy the ep anyway so this might not make a huge difference anyways   honestly i don t know what i m talking about  i m tired ,1,418,76
not long enough  i need more ,1,29,6
this is really clever as they will end up charting really high in america now,1,77,15
soft jisoo  ground breaking concept,1,35,5
even better then   ,1,19,4
i m so excited   can t wait for new bp music  ,1,46,11
ticketmaster has usually pretty crazy fees but is obviously a reliable  well established service  it s easy to get ahold of them and can solve problems fast plus the interface is just easier to navigate and seems to be able to handle lots of traffic at once  both the app and the website work well  i ve only used axs a few times  and while in my experience  the fees weren t as bad  but using the website was just not very user friendly  it s slow and has a pretty shitty queue system that takes forever to get through  i ve used the app once and it was okay  you probably won t have a choice when it comes to the venue you use  like for my show  fort worth  it s through axs  but i believe venues like the forum in la use ticketmaster  if there is a presale  definitely take advantage of it because there s been times i waited till general on sale for better tickets but either ended up with nothing or just very expensive tickets ,1,933,173
so cute,1,7,2
wow   that look,1,15,4
that s great ,1,13,2
in your opinion is it better to buy from axs or ticketmaster ,1,61,12
basically    we should expect the ep late march  early april  ,1,62,10
her eyes wow am i already in heaven  ,1,37,8
and [cute]  ,1,12,2
ros  s  oh damn   ,1,18,4
does anyone know if there are vip tickets for all na concerts ,1,62,12
they are just different ticketing services  and which one being used just depends on the venue  but i imagine this promotion will be available across every date no matter the service  since that s usually the case when it comes to other tours ,1,243,42
yes sorry for not putting the source but this is it   from the axs website   ,1,77,16
omg i have so many questions ,1,29,6
any difference between buying from axs and ticketmaster  ,1,57,8
ya i m suspicious  this is suspicious ,1,38,6
not op but i found the source   [ ,1,34,8
it was  not up on youtube yet though,1,36,8
was the forever young performance not broadcasted ,1,50,7
wait this is real  holy hell  ,1,30,6
it really does make me mad  just because she puts on a powerful front doesn t mean that she s rude  we all know she s a major softie   ,1,135,27
rose is so well spoken and relatable if that makes any sense  jennie was definitely shy when she s put on the spot  but she had her ad lib and one sentence moments  she ll be more comfortable if they get more opportunities like these  she was great on the colbert pop quiz  lisa and jisoo didn t get to speak much but they were so quirky with their body language  this was their first interview so i didn t expect them all to be in their comfort zone for their first interview  ,1,478,89
jisoo and lisa really didn t open their mouths outside of introducing themselves  oh well ,1,90,14
jisso and lisa really didn t open their mouths outside of introducing themselves  oh well ,1,90,14
he made a comment like the blinks were gonna grab a slice and i saw jisoo eyeing that pizza ,1,92,19
yeah  i m hoping is not just a  here s the dvd of the tour  buy the dvd   and we actually get something like blackpink house 2 0 i guess we ll find out eventually ,1,163,31
they re like a john  paul  george  and ringo  albeit in a kind of aloof and condescending way in this video  she has the same kind of expression i d imagine cercei would have if she had to interact with the teeming masses  ,1,223,41
while it is somewhat short  still a great interview  they presented themselves as very genuine and likeable  ros  carried as expected from the preview  joking with the hosts are just very confident  lisa with her little dance move  getting  strahan and sara  involved and while jisoo didn t really say anything outside of the introduction her charisma was just so positive  man i am looking forward to the next us interviews when they ll promote during their us tour  it will be great   ,1,487,82
sorry this is kinda random but am i crazy or does [she look a lot like nayeon here]  ,1,85,18
lol now i m picturing her blurting that out lying on the ground,1,63,12
i ve never seen this shot before  if this this a new concept image i m going to cry lol,1,87,18
 i m jisoo  i m ok  ,1,20,4
my heart would burst  it s all over at that point ,1,50,10
i m officially dead  ty jisoo,1,29,5
strahan grabbed that for himself  555,1,37,6
seeing her shine has been my favorite part of the whole us media tour for sure,1,78,16
i wanted to see them eat the pizza lol,1,38,9
oh jisoo  did it hurt when you fell from heaven ,1,48,10
too short for my taste but i ll take what i can get  i think ros  is really shining lately  she seems so confident and not nervous to talk at all  i m loving this confident queen ,1,179,35
so sweet,1,8,2
they have been having a camera following them around on tour and in the us  so we should be getting something soon   ,1,117,23
why can t we get blackpink house 2 0  the first one was before dddd  and so many things have happened  i think it s time for a second one ,1,138,27
    and now the fan is presumably dead  if jennie blew a kiss anywhere near me i d be done for   ,1,97,21
good interview  a little short but the girls did well and came across as so genuine  lt 3 ,1,90,17
that human sized teddy bear is so lucky ,1,40,8
i have no doubt that blackpink is going to be the first girl group with a song reaching a billion views  maybe even kpop group in general  they re already the only ones with 3 videos w  500 million views  i still remember when gee had the most amount of views for a kpop girl group  and bigbang had the most for boy groups  and now is blackpink and bts  i remember feeling so proud when they got to 300 million and now  300 million sounds like something that can easily be achievable  when we know is not that easy  but blinks somehow are so focused and dedicated that it truly seems like it  when i think of this era  dddd  i honestly can say that there was blackpink before dddd and after  they have reached heights i didn t though was going to be possible right now  maybe something for a year or two down the line  but no  they really showed that they are this generations snsd  in being the standard   we just need to get the physicals up  because their digitals are out of this world  they re their own brand  people use them as parameters of success  they really are the girl group  blackpink is truly the revolution  and i m readyyyyyyyyy ,1,1147,212
there was a seating map with the prices on it on the venue website for atlanta  floor was  269  lower level was  104   154  and  204  and upper level was  79 and  104 ,1,167,33
is the lenses that she is using the ones that they advertise  she is def rocking them ,1,86,17
i m pretty sure that she s going to be the most followed soon  jennie is going up as well  i think we may see both of them occupying the number one and two spots  i do think that lisa will continue to be number one  she seems to be more popular overseas   in any case  i would like to see all the girls in the first four spots  but that seems to be a tall order  but who knows  there s the comeback in march  and than ros  is going to have her solo  we may see a spike in their followers  also  the tour is giving them an oportunity to showcase themselves a little more  and more people are checking them out    with how everything is going  and coachella around the corner as well  they just may get there  ,1,708,138
i m going to watch this every time i cry over anything  my heart just exploded  lt 33333,1,88,16
i love canada  but sorry i m not canadian or going  i just wanted to say i love canada     ,1,91,19
imagine being jennie  waking up and already looking amazing    how can i be her  truly a goddess ,1,97,17
the food looks delicious  and they really seem to have the place for themselves  that s nice  ,1,94,16
she s truly an angel ,1,21,4
there is no way i would stop crying if she did that to me,1,57,14
she s so hot ,1,13,3
ugh wish i could have been there    i d have cried even more  to be honest    ,1,78,16
i almost looks like they have the entire restaurant to themselves,1,65,11
i learned this the hard way  for ticketmaster  go 20 minutes and keep refreshing  if you don t refresh you won t get into the  pre queue   ,1,139,24
she ll be  1 overall pretty soon  her daily followers gain far surpasses all of the ppl ahead of her plus there s a comeback soon  ,1,131,24
  love it ,1,10,3
she is unbelievably beautiful   ,1,32,5
jennie has done so many nice things like this and people still think she is mean   ,1,83,16
get to the website early  sometimes there is a virtual queue  ,1,62,11
this girl is a whole mood  ,1,27,6
thank you so much  ,1,19,4
on sale 2 20  this is from the link on ygs website  ,1,52,11
i came here just to say that  ,1,30,8
it s crazy to think they couldn t be drinking that wine when they debuted ,1,74,13
the highest for a korean artist right now is chanyeol at 17m  isn t it ,1,71,14
my tears of joy would flow like a waterfall   ,1,46,9
 cries a bit  jennie  don t cry  i love you   starts bawling ,1,61,11
she s the definition of uwu ,1,28,5
haha at first i thought it was the person taking that closeup screaming like that  and then i realized they were up in the rafters and it made the video much funnier for some reason  i assumed they had like a soundcheck pass or something ,1,238,45
  caption    thank you singapore for coming to our 1st concert  it was such a beautiful night   [  source  ]  ,1,110,17

any other detroit blinks going ,1,31,5
and the shell ,1,14,3
this usually happens when idols go on tours  as idols usually sings and dances especially those that are dance heavy they really burns alot of calories on stage  i hope the managers make sure they have enough rests and foods to last them the whole tour ,1,253,46
does anybody know if ticket tiers pricing will be posted in adv  much easier to plan ahead with friends than making a last min decision once the tickets are on sale  thanks  ,1,174,31
hey  just adding what i know from past experience  i can only speak for the hamilton  canada  location and im basing it on how the bts tickets sold out  price wise i would say you are looking at a  100 150 minimum and tickets will sell out in probably 10 minutes or less if in being honest  i assume less since kpop has grown significantly since bts came and blackpink has a pretty big following as well  knowing there are multiple locations in the us perhaps it won t sell out as fast but i d still aim to buy as soon as sale opens  ,1,534,102
i tried to get some for the berlin concert but like 20 min  later they were sold out  i didn t have any time right away so i didn t get a chance to see the prices ,1,163,35

that top right image is reigniting my jisoo vs ros  bias war  ,1,62,13
something about ros  just gives you that  neighbor next door  vibe  seems so chill and down to earth  ,1,102,18
she does not need to talk  her stage presence in every performance speaks for herself even the members know how much swag she s got  ,1,133,23
why     she don t talk anything on the show tho ,1,48,10
also stl and hoping to get tickets,1,34,7
we can only hope  it was really popular and that was before 4d was released ,1,76,15

it seems like for bp  whenever there is a music performance video is uploaded  most likely on youtube  the views  comments and then subscribe numbers skyrocketed  like abc7 news uploaded their dddd performance on gma  colbert s one  the forever young fancam on strahan and sara     they are crazy        most of the views are definitely from blinks  and i really can t think of how it is even possible  another so called milestone is that the total stream count of bp songs on spotify has now reached 1 billion times  i can conclude that blinks are really determined  and somewhat crazily determined  if that s the real case               ,1,639,104
dang she s catchig up to gd,1,27,6
composer  producer  lyricist  everything  leader of king of kpop named bigbang  an elder brother for the pinks  ,1,112,17
what a cutie pie  she looks taller in the bottom pic lmfaooooo ,1,63,12
really  i went to bts  yeah the venue is old and i would prefer toyota music factory if i had a choose but it was still a great experience and show  and at the end of the day that is all that matters  ,1,201,43
her followers will surpass the bp account itself soon ,1,54,9
probably blue but personally will be trying to get ga,1,53,10
in thai language  the number 5 is pronounced as  ha   so thai s write 5555 for hahahaha  or 55555555 for something really funny  ,1,129,22
what is 5555 ,1,13,3
is there a reason it s chosen  bts played in the same facility ,1,63,12
who is gd ,1,10,3
yes lets make a group  i m planning on getting a pink vip  ,1,59,12
bts played in the same facility so there must be a reason  i looked at some pictures and the seating arrangement seems like a good viewing experience for everyone ,1,163,29
are you telling me the fierce queen from the solo mv is that little cutie patootie high schooler in the bottom pic  ,1,116,22
haha nice    hope you have fun ,1,31,7
i m in stl but i m going  let s hope we can get the tickets before they sell out ,1,81,17
and she deserves every single one of them,1,41,8
omg i hope so  a bitch is broke ,1,32,8
prediction   skyrocketing  lisa is too loveable ,1,48,7
also i ve made a discord channel for us nj ny folk  in case you re interested  it s brand new so it may be a bit deserted to start    ,1,134,26
cool  i wanna hit up my first kcon this year hopefully  i ve made a discord channel for us nj ny folk  in case you re interested  it s brand new so it may be a bit deserted to start    ,1,185,36
which area you think has the best view price ,1,45,8
i ve made a discord channel for us nj ny folk  in case you re interested  it s brand new so it may be a bit deserted to start    ,1,129,25
haha same  hopefully nothing to crazy   here s the channel  freshly made so bare with me lol   ,1,95,16
i may be a dude  but that won t stop me from shouting  girls wanna have some fun  at the concert,1,96,20
cool  i just wanna know prices ,1,31,6
yeah i ll try to set one up right now ,1,38,9
you should set up a discoed 24m here  probably going solo so getting a group sounds great,1,89,17
sounds good ,1,12,2
damn get it girl ,1,17,4
36 m i ll be going  haven t been back to prudential since kcon 2017  not sure if wife is coming or not  depends on work ,1,120,23
same   i hope so too  i really can only afford nosebleed seats  lol,1,67,13
this is great info thank you ,1,29,6
someone on twitter emailed axs and they said tickets are  79  259  ,1,67,11
that s true  i can t go  but apart of me was excited it was in ft  worth as i m from there and most part of me feels they deserve a better spot,1,143,31
it s just old and run down  has poor organization and not really suitable for concerts ,1,87,15
yeah  hopefully we can get a channel under the blackpink server but if it s not possible  i ll pm you to work something out,1,123,23
i m so excited  i have a calendar reminder on the day the tix are available so i can hurry and buy them    hopefully i can afford it lol,1,136,28
i feel ya    hopefully  we can find a way to meet people  i ll update everyone on what i was able to find tho   ,1,112,24
i totally want to go  but i m scared to see what the price is lmao  also from bcs area so that s neat,1,101,22
i m really curious how their u s  appearances have affected their follower count,1,80,12
and gd is at 16 3m   ,1,21,6
what s wrong with the venue ,1,28,5
a variety show  look up we will channel you blackpink,1,53,10
i ll be there  i hope  read a lot of horror stories on twitter about the bts concert that was at the same venue last year  really wish they chose american airlines in dallas instead     lol  ,1,191,36
haha yeah  i noticed you said  group of dudes  and assumed you were a dude lol  figured i start a thread for the ladies in here instead of making a new post  ,1,158,32
i hope you will be able to make it    if so  let me know  ,1,58,15
ahh i see  well i gotta feel out how many responses and people i can find before trying to arrange much  i ll let you know ,1,123,25
i m definitely not a part of that group  18 m here haha but i hope you find your group and have a good time ,1,108,23
confirmed red is a colour for jennie  but her favourite colours are black and pink lol,1,86,15
i also called and they said to definitely use the website and take advantage of the axs waiting room for tickets vs going to the box office in person to purchase  he said while they do have some tickets set aside  if it s a fast selling event  those will go quickly and then you re just waiting on someone to fight the same online ticket lines like you would at home ,1,367,70
wonder if the girls have their valentines,1,41,7
kansas here wish i could go tho ,1,32,7
same here  hoping to get tickets    ,1,36,7
the venue for atlanta is in a suburb which is about a 45min 2hr drive  depending on traffic  from the airport  you ll definitely need to rent a car  as public transit is mostly non existent in the area  if you re going to stay near the venue  infinite energy arena  there are a lot of hotels restaurants grocery stores and the area is very safe ,1,345,60
i m hoping i ll be able to afford traveling from md to the newark show   25f here ,1,82,15
hey everyone  chicago blink here  i m definitely going to the chicago show and would love to meet up with someone or some of you guys because i am going by myself  sadly  i have no blink friends   ,1,197,39
are we listening to the same songs  teddy s beats and song writing are heavily influenced by american pop  and hip hop  source  i m an american that dislikes all other kpop besides bp  i ve tried  and i keep giving other groups a chance but i can t get into the music  also my brother   who listens to zero kpop  but likes trap  also thinks that their songs have an american trap esque style to them  especially ddu du ddu du   amp  x200b  also american music charts used to have more boy bands and girls groups before the music industry tanked  i think that bp could fill that void with their model looks  high budget music videos  and dope choreo ,1,649,111
i live in minnesota  but im really hoping to get tickets and go ,1,64,13
i want to have good seats if they don t have vip  if they have it i am going to that whether it s standing or not  i don t see any golden circle situations yet  but if i am getting a seat i want it to be as close as possible  but ill have to see the seats if you trying to coordinate something  ,1,295,62
cool  do you have any idea where you re gonna sit  i m trying to buys seats in the ring right around floor seats,1,112,22
it s views like this that made interscope believe that bp s appeal could translate well in the us  when you have a kpop group capable of yt views that even american artists cannot achieve then you know they are hella popular  ,1,226,40
nah all girl groups  i looked up little mix  fifth harmony  and spice girls and they don t  ,1,92,17
28 f from pa going sololololololo to this show  husband is dropping me off at the venue bc he has no interest in going haha  looking for other ladies over 21 to hang with   maybe meet up somewhere for a few drinks with first or something  or whatever ,1,251,48
im trying to go to this one and would be interested in a meet up maybe  ,1,72,16
came here to ask the same thing    but i m not taking my chances with them  i rather try to get retail value before resorting to scalpers ,1,138,26
i d help manage the atlanta one ,1,32,6
we will channel you  what s that  ,1,34,6
but they made their international debut in america  they re obviously trying to appeal to american audiences if they go on shows like gma and plan to attend one of the biggest us music festivals  ,1,196,34
hey  i m a 16 year old chicago blink and i ll probably go along with my twin sister  if you find a discord or groupchat hmu   ,1,126,26
hey man i m a chicago blink and i will most likely go  if i am going i ll let you know ,1,87,20
they all look so incredibly relaxed and cheery  especially jennie  this video makes me so happy  i love them so much  ,1,118,21
fyi  here is another post of someone looking to connect with atlanta blinks  [   amp  x200b ,1,92,15
btw  i will be down to create a server on discord for each concert venue if someone is willing to help me manage them  i m not the most tech saavy lol ,1,151,31
update feb 14  2019 the hot topic at eaton centre had two blackpink shirts  the pink one and the white one  pretty pricey as the shirt was around  38 before tax but at least i ll have bp merch when i  hopefully get tickets to  go to their concert in april   ,1,258,51
      you just made my day  ,1,28,6
i feel ya  i have the same issue  i don t really  know  anyone who like k pop  i have been trying to find a way to have blinks for specific areas connect with each other  for example  i m in chicago and i would love other blinks    i posted a question earlier today  hopefully something will come up  [   amp  x200b ,1,316,58
taking pics of the food  such girls  lol,1,40,8

thanks  i ll check it out ,1,26,5
it looks a lot like paul s on times square  136 w 42nd st  new york  ny 10036,1,77,17
holy shit flume and blackpink on the same day damnn,1,51,10
they are playing radio city music hall in nyc   i hear the acoustics there are amazing so really looking forward to it  ,1,120,23
i just checked the tour listing for them and the closest they get to me is dc or pa  i m in n c ,1,96,22
i m in manitowoc near green bay ugh that s too bad  ,1,52,10
where do you live  they are touring this spring  haven t seem them yet   yah  i was totally not expecting to see them ever  then boom  i would love to see portishead too ,1,170,32
i love rv  my 2nd fave after aoa  and perfume  but i m most jealous of the fact that you got to see massive attack  the closest i came to something like that was seeing portishead in miami beach back in 98 ,1,206,41
and pwf,1,7,2
i would ve have wanted to go far either  it was freezing that night   ,1,70,14
don t recognize it  could be pretty much anywhere ,1,50,8
they said they were staying near times square  so i d imagine they didn t travel far  ,1,86,15
i m just thinking there must be some delicious food to ros  s left,1,66,12
  it s not much to go on  but there you go   ,1,45,11
where is the photo  someone recognizing the place is pretty much the only shot ,1,79,14
yep  there s a lot  they posted a picture of themselves at the restaurant and they have a lot of fans  so i was just checking in case somebody knew ,1,148,29
if they don t say  and nobody saw them  there s basically no way to know  you know how many italian restaurants are in nyc  ,1,124,23
cross post is diabled here  and it s already posted here  ,1,58,10
i actually haven t watched the boombayah mv in forever so this was a nice reminder to make me watch it again and wow   honestly i thought i had seen it all but there were scenes that i had never noticed before haha,1,214,41
anyone recognize the location though  it looks like an abandoned theme park ,1,76,12
only kpop group in general,1,26,5
new york new york i wanna wake up in a cuty that doesn t sleep frank sinatra,1,76,15
source    for some reason this the bp reddit doesn t show up on my subscription list  so i was unable to cross post ,1,116,22
disagree  their current style is what got them here  i think they have the perfect balance of rap and pop and that s what makes them stand out  it would be disingenuous for them to change their sound so drastically just to fit in and i think it would backfire on them  for what it s worth  i am an ariana grande fan and i absolutely  hate  how she s changing her sound to be more hip hop trap oriented  and i am actually a huge  longtime fan of hip hop  but it sounds so insincere and ridiculous coming from her  7 rings is pure garbage  the reason i started liking her was her powerful vocals and ballads  this whole  yuh  nonsense and her fake baddy attitude is making me dislike her  and i m not the only one who thinks this  she s actually getting a lot of backlash for this  so  bp needs to stay true to themselves  not everyone is going to be into their sound  but that s okay  they are doing just fine and have quite an impressive western fanbase as it is  they don t need to change to suit everyone s tastes  the second i hear lisa saying  yuh  is the moment i will start to lose interest ,1,1097,204
yeah sadly they cut it    i was in the audience and ready to sing along but they skipped right to the final verse ,1,114,24
lalalalisa is such a cutie  lt 3,1,32,6

mainland chinese  of course     they are literally affecting hongkongers  lives every day  no need to explain further   amp  x200b  i should say south korean locals  i visited seoul before and my experience was not really good ,1,227,35
there are tickets for sale on stubhub and viagogo etc  before the official sale date  are those legit ,1,102,18
jisoo is so adorable ,1,21,4
ah i see  but it s odd you think south korean tourists are rude  they re a very respectful country  perhaps maybe you re thinking about mainland chinese tourists  perhaps i m generalizing but they get a bad rep for being rude ,1,226,38
actually i was highly prejudiced against k pop  and almost everything about korea  mainly south korea  north korea because of the political issues  before  mainly due to the soulless songs and lyrics  the atmosphere that encouraged plastic surgeries in the entertainment business  and the rudeness of korean tourists  etc   based on the news i read and my inherent impressions towards south korea during the past years  i didn t listen to much k pop before  only a bit of wonder girls  snsd and then psy   but after listened to dddd  i sort of changed my mind a little bit  and then it came solo  and i started to find more about the four members  after that i discovered this community  haha ,1,693,118
rhcp  two door  r3hab and blackpink in the same lineup  god i want to go  ,1,74,15
what were you before  lol,1,25,5
jennie in la  lt 3,1,18,4
yes  they have lots of potentials and can try many more music styles  but their local k pop characteristics are something which contribute to their huge success and should not be easily given up   amp  x200b  also  i believe quality  gt  quantity  but quantity is still needed  ,1,278,45
and because of your optimism  also from this reddit community   i believe i am now a blink lol  thanks ,1,103,19
2m views already  i believe this is now the most watched musical performance video on colbert s show ,1,101,16
prices look normal for a top tier kpop group  no offence to red velvet but they re a step below bp  concert organizers try to reach a state of equilibrium in how much they charge based on demand for an artist without scaring ppl away ,1,234,44

ye pretty much same thing lmao,1,30,6
it says  hottest   i agree  haha,1,32,6

too pretty  gosh ,1,17,3
i cried,1,7,2
look  all the links you posted either provided wrong or misleading information   and i already told you sometimes i just wished the media would stop mess up the terms  ambassador  and  pr ambassador   look  it s a bit hard to explain   but to be the chanel ambassador  you are much more than simply endorsing promoting chanel product   you need to be chanel  it gets much more personal than being just the endorser  the ambassador is the face of the brand  meaning   not only cosmetics or costume line  but all chanel products  and most importantly  you need to catch the eyes of karl lagerfield  jennie is the ambassador and model for chanel cosmetics line   not the chanel ambassador  this one can give you a pretty accurate image of how chanel choose their ambassador   never hasty to buy into any kind of partnership  chanel carefully and steadily cultivates its ambassadors  year after year  before signing zhou xun as the brand s ambassador for china in 2011  chanel had been collaborating with the actress and singer for five years  over this extended period of time  the brand was able to determine that zhou xun s qualities and image were indeed consistent with chanel s  and in order to make sure this would continue  as soon as the deal was sealed  chanel started to effectively influence all aspects of her professional life  from public appearances to having a hand in choosing her outfits  make up and hair styles   [  even zhou xun needed 5 years to officially become the ambassador   the face of chanel  gd has been seen wearing chanel for years  but only officially became the ambassador in 2016  jennie  on the other hand  has been announced as the face of the cosmetics line  and she has been consistently promoting chanel cosmetics products since then  but that doesn t make her the ambassador  not yet  it s still too early for her to become one  she hasn t appeared on chanel instagram nor website either   now tell me why the ambassador still hasn t make her appearance on the brand s sns yet   amp  x200b  jennie still has a long way to go  but she has to potential to become one  first  she will need to meet karl  let me tell you  the treatment between the face of chanel and other ambassadors is really different   amp  x200b   amp  x200b   amp  x200b ,1,2279,390
i want to squish the cheeks ,1,28,6
 gt  i just wanted to thank all the lovely people who gave me the best birthday i could ever ask for  i definitely feel very welcomed into  22  haha  one day i was sad i couldn t spend my birthday back at home with family  but here i find myself feeling like i spent a birthday like no other  i was congratulated by so many staff on the set of our first us tv appearance  followed by the adorable us fans who waited hours outside in the cold just to sing me a happy birthday song  and ofcoarse being able to spend a lovely dinner with the four members was a definite perk   all i m trying to say is that i am so grateful for yet another amazing birthday and that i ll always do my best to pay it all back  thank u   [source]  ,1,726,144
i flippin  wanna go so bad  but i m literally on vacation in the us when the tickets go on sale  probably gonna buy resale tickets  but they re gonna be so over priced      ,1,173,33

when i first found their mvs i thot jisoo and rose were the same person and jennie and lisa were the same person lmao,1,117,24
when i first saw them lisa was the only one i could tell apart lol,1,66,15
tbf i don t exercise much and my ribs are still visible  it s genetic  with that said i still think it d be ok for them to gain some weight  but as long as they re not unhealthy      ,1,183,36

blackpink s and brockhampton on the same day oh my lord  it d be hilarious if they were fans of each other and posted ig stories singing rapping their songs ,1,157,27
so cute  the setting looks like brooklyn lol,1,44,8
the western market is not just america  ,1,40,7
with all due respect  and with no offense intended  i couldn t disagree more  their sound and the fact they aren t like all the pop and hip hop dreck released in the us is what makes me love them  if be seriously let down if they changed to sound like modern us pop and hip hop,1,277,55
so  freaking  adorable  ,1,24,3
ah  i see  but still damn tiring if you ask me  hopefully they keep their strenghts up  ,1,88,17
i don t think there has been a definitive word on it  the organizers seem to be giving differen t answers ,1,106,19
lmao i m girl in the yellow   ,1,30,7
lisas bod goalssss,1,18,3
i think you and the op both have valid points  i don t like the idea of bp abruptly putting out a different sound  especially something they themselves may not be readily comfortable with  just to attract a particular audience  but it is a little worrying to think about how the general american audience might receive their current music because op is right that in american music timeline terms  their edm sound is a little bit outdated and trap very much seems to be the  meta  right now  personally  i think their current music style will do fine because yge s style for their groups is that indie   half asleep  method of singing which resonates with americans through similar sounding artists like lana del rey  halsey  lorde  etc  i don t expect bp s music to dominate the charts and radio over here but at least their music is much more consume able  for western audiences  than say the super bubble gum pop sound of groups like twice or apink  ,1,953,164
headliners are better that s for sure ,1,38,6
better lineup than coachella ,1,29,4
they arrived home yesterday  ,1,29,4
i actually think ddu du ddu du has a lot of hip hop elements in  as does boombayah  ,1,84,18
enjoy it   i m hoping that i can at least get tickets for the north america tour  la  it ll be full out war to get tickets,1,122,25
have fun  well  i think on the bright side  they will be back in singapore in a couple of years while developing themselves more as artists in between  so that s cool to me too ,1,177,34
didnt they arrive like an hour ago  holy hell that must be tiring,1,65,13
oof  back to back flights  ,1,27,5
disagree  they are perfect the way it is  the reason why blackpink is able to this popular internationally is because their  and yg in general  s music is somewhat americanized compared to other typical k pop groups  it s the reason why they are able to enter the american market in the first place  they ve got a perfect mix of westernized   korean sounds in their music ,1,372,64
my perspective of it is that they don t need to conform to what s current  i agree that i d love to see blackpink evolve musically over time  but i don t agree with the sentiment that they need to do it to conform to western standards  they re not releasing music to simply succeed in the western market  i just don t believe that was their goal as blackpink  they don t need to change what got them their in the first place  don t get me wrong  i expect blackpink to evolve musically over time but to do so in such an abrupt manner is unnatural and forced  you re simply ignoring your foundation and the audience that you ve attracted  this is why i strongly support their double title track releases  it lets fans have the best of both worlds  ,1,746,134
if only i could go   red hot chili peppers  bring me the horizon  babymetal  blackpink  and machine gun kelly are some of my favorite artists  sounds like an epic festival ,1,172,29
they are flying out to singapore not arriving ,1,46,8
they are going to be spending a lot of time on airplanes this year  i find it difficult to sleep well on planes  but i hope they can  so they can get some much needed rest ,1,172,36
i think they ll continue with the style that they have and not change it to fit a mold  i was watching a yt video by some american music producers that have produce some successful kpop songs and one of the questions was asked  why go to korea  they said in korea they are free to create unique sounds and music they have been wanting to do for while  but were unable to do in america  because here they are forced into certain sound  i like the idea of creative people being able to express the creativity without limits  therefore  i hope bp and teddy continue to make their own style of music  umg signed them based on their current music  so they must think there is a space for it here  ,1,692,131
awww   i was only able to get online  and the last addition of tickets  thats why my queue is 7xxx but i m happy for the sound check ,1,133,27
no they don t ,1,14,3
i envy you all tbh  took leave to buy  yet i failed to get 1 t t,1,64,16
yeah please dont buy tickets on those sites until past the official release day  pro tip  if youre tight on a budget  theres usually a lot of people who have to cancel last minute and will need to sell off their tickets at a loss on occasion  so you can wait it out if youre looking for a good deal  dont get scammed  just be careful ask for receipt and photo id and if its too good to be true then find another ticket  as always  never pay using paypal gift  ,1,460,90
you bought it off someone else  oh that s risky flying there and getting nothing in return ,1,91,16
wow the lineup is straight fire  so proud of the girls to be on that list ,1,74,16
probably flying out to singapore later tonight or early tmrw morning ,1,69,11
does anyone know if there s gonna be any vip packages for the na tour ,1,70,14

music is  vintage  by niki off her album zephyr  my most underrated album for last year  it s really dope  i was so happy when lisa shouted her out last year as well because she s been on my top breakout artists prior  ,1,219,41
omg they re so cute     and that transition from ros  to chaeng after rosie s hair flip lmao  wish the video was longer though  ,1,128,23
i know this isn t the same crowd  but when babymetal was on colbert  they had to fit their three dancers  an entire band  and and all their equipment on an even smaller stage  they were basically doing their choreography in the audience  jezebel doesn t know what cramped is ,1,275,48
okay hmu if you re able to    goodluck  ,1,40,8
i still haven t got a ticket tbh   meant to get mine tomorrow so fingers crossed it s all legitimate and i can see you there   ,1,127,25

lollapalooza lineup comes out in march so it d be announced before their coachella performance  ,1,96,14
i think it s definitely possible,1,32,5
it s actually kinda sad how hypocritical and close minded some of those ppl are in the comments  funny i went to kcon ny two years in a row and it s amazing to see people coming together from all races and ethnicity s to enjoy music  some people are so angry and judgmental for no reason ,1,288,54
ahh i see okay thanks ,1,22,4
tomorrow only and there will definitely be a queue before the merchandise stand opens ,1,86,14
same here  wish they would release it a week or two beforehand so people can know what to exactly save  if not exact price  just an estimate would be nice  ,1,156,30
question are they only available tomorrow or are they already open right now  im new to this whole concert thing,1,112,19
not sure how long there performance will be but they ll probably have to perform everyone of their songs to fill in the set list ,1,129,24
no problem    hoping official prices come out soon though  don t wanna be surprised on the day of d ,1,100,19
thank you so much   it has given me a rough idea at least ,1,58,13
jezebel was always a shit website  don t give them any web traffic ,1,67,12
wait so was jennie s rap cut for this performance   ,1,52,9
one size is extremely common in asia and for sweaters one size is typically a men s us m  since oversized sweaters is the style typically,1,137,25
pretty jacked up  i bought the lightstick in korea for 20 000 won which is around  18,1,85,16
i hope they do whistle  ,1,24,5
totally agree with this  dddd pwf whistle or even really are definitely the most western influenced and would ve been the best choices to introduce bp to the us  also agree that cute concepts wouldn t do well here  ,1,215,34
i wonder if it s possible to rule the us market without an all english album though  for now the kpop fans are still considered niche outside korea  would the average american buy an album that isn t in english  ,1,212,38
i love aiiyl  but i don t think it would fair well for mainstream western audiences  but who knows really  ,1,107,19
they re having a comeback in march so the amount of songs shouldn t be a problem for coachella ,1,95,17
from what i ve heard  it s really common in parts of asia  it s cheaper to only make one size  and on average they are smaller than over here in the west   amp  x200b ,1,167,31
well for atlanta the prices were up by accident  [here is a screenshot from another user]   so i m gonna assume they will be the same more or less for la  i m praying send off is no more than  400 ,1,197,39
i don t think those people selling actually have the tickets though    unless they got them before release somehow ,1,115,18
will definitely do so if i can take part  i think ticketmaster usually has presale for amex cardholders if i remember correctly   ,1,130,23
cute concepts probably won t do too well in america  pwf whistle would in my opinion be the best songs they could perform  that or one of their side tracks from square up ,1,171,31
wow they re practically giving it away at that price now,1,56,10
to be fair  its sgd  so its  only    82 usd,1,43,10
ikr i thought i was the only one,1,32,8

 is there a way to connect with other blinks for each city  i m in the discords server but there isn t a server for let s say  chicago blinks  i also don t see a sub or fb group where other blinks can connect    any tips  ,1,222,43
is there a way to connect with other blinks for each city  i m in the discords server but there isn t a server for let s say  chicago blinks  i also don t see a sub or fb group where other blinks can connect    any tips ,1,220,43
something small i just wanted to point out  i really love how they gave rose a little blanket to cover herself  it s super common in korea but not so much in america  props to the late show for being sensitive and accommodating    ,1,231,43
hahaha i love the chemistry between colbert and babtiste  this photo makes me happy   ,1,86,15
love my girls but the shirt designs are so ugly ,1,48,10
some people just can t get through the day without being outraged or playing the victim  pathetic  on the plus side  i couldn t take my eyes off lisa ,1,150,27
this cultural appropriation bullshit just needs to end  it s been going on since the beginning of trade  except now people gave it a fancy name so they could get fake angry over it   ,1,183,33
jennie and red  what a perfect combo ,1,37,7
i m sure many companies are looking at them thinking that maybe they could have the next big thing  but i believe in timing  so many acts had to try and fail for it to finally happen  i don t think it s luck that we finally have groups like bts or blackpink being able to do more than what other groups were able to  they have the blueprint from the failure of other groups  they know what they need to do  or at least  they know what not to do  which is a valuable information to have  it helps the fact that it s a perfect storm of having more english speakers  including people who were actually born outside of korea  in the case of ros    and having a sound that is a lot more acceptable in the western world  while still being something that koreans find it cool and interesting  striking the balance between being western friendly while still being something koreans would want to listen to often is incredible difficult and i m sure one of the reasons why we don t have that many groups trying  or should i say  succeeding  ,1,1032,189
it s about time they get some decent merch  the fact that towels are ranked higher on the list than their shirts says enough ,1,125,23
i m not gonna lie   i posted here a couple months ago that i didn t believe blackpink would be booking stadiums in the us  boy was i wrong  so proud of them  i ve spent all my spring 2019 concert budget on red velvet  perfume and massive attack  i m gonna need to blow up my cc for this i guess  if any of you blinks can t make this show bc you can t afford a hotel  dm me  i live pretty close  hoboken  and my wife and i have a guest room for 1  i m going to the show alone as well  bc my wife doesn t get it at all    ,1,520,109
dunno  but how you gonna sell clothing in  one size   smh ,1,58,11
it really feels like night and day  what we get from them in korea  versus what we are getting in the us  the difference between a company that knows how to market its artists  and how to take care of them  versus a company that is horrible managed  i mean  how can you have the talent that is blackpink  and not have a plan of action of what you need to do or what is necessary to make sure they become as big as they can  sometimes i feel like the girls are getting bigger despite yge being the mess that it is  when you look at other girl groups of somewhat similar calibre  twice  red velvet  and how much content they already have  it feels like a wasteland on this side  thank god the girls are amazingly talented and have great personalities that make people want to wait for them  any other group would have already been buried  they re so luck and don t even know it ,1,876,167
and i truly hope it stays this way  they re so many places that are really unfriendly to blackpink  that is nice to have our little piece of heaven here  makes it for a very pleasant experience  ,1,195,36
i think it all depends on how well recieved their coachella gig is going to be  i don t have any fear that they re going to knock it out of the park  they have what it takes  i have a feeling that coachella is going to be huge  and just the fact that  given the little amount of songs they have  they re still one of the biggest names in it  and the fact that they were handpicked by the ceo to perform in it  is only a matter of time before they are one of the headliners  i m hoping everything goes to plan  i want to see them everywhere  all the festivals  all the concerts  more countries  stadium tours    let s hope it all goes the way we want  and soon blackpink will be in everyone s area  or so we hope   ,1,714,139
i totally agree  although people seem to want to forget all of the dc movies ,1,77,15
i like fy  but staying true to the view counts  aiiyl night have been a good choice as well  especially since america got a little glimpse of it in a movie  ,1,157,31
and then some ,1,14,3
welcome to liberal left life y all who s not from usa or isn t aware of the insanity these ppl parrot for the sake of political correctness  amp  other actually non significant but over exagerrated issues  ,1,206,32
i ve only been to infinite energy for hockey events  but i ve always been happy with our seats  the nosebleeds don t feel as such  and i ve even commented with family that it s not all that worth it to buy more expensive seats  now   i don t know how that applies to concerts  but it feels a lot more intimate compared to other large atlanta venues such as state farm arena  formally phillips  or  if you re old like me  the georgia dome ,1,438,80
if there s a presale for your show  take it   a legit one  that is   i battled for a ticket on presale for london  but it s just as well i did because the show sold out general sale in less than a minute  ,1,205,42
uh what   where does bp appropriate black culture and in what way is dddd any racist   lmfao these people sound so helpless and dumb,1,132,24
oh shit  i hope i m allowed to take mine to london    ,1,54,11
they live together  what are they even doing calling and texting each other all the time   ,1,91,17
i hope they do korean with english rap  selfish reason   i just want to be able to sing along fluently  ,1,104,21
off topic but i hope they remix the end of boombayha for coachella  ,1,68,13
i thought this might be referring to the fact that jennie ended up bumped up against the step a couple of times  but whatever   ,1,128,25
 a little bit english  lisa is humble af considering her pronunciation was on point for that entire set of sentences ,1,117,20
dat frame rate,1,14,3
wow are these prices jacked up  i swear on korean sites they are maybe half the price of these listed ,1,102,20
1 sgd     0 74 usd,1,18,6
i think that the whole idea of what a person s ethnicity or nationality is will continue to shift in the future  for example  there are many asians living in america and we are american  there are indians who grow up in australia who are australian  if lisa is a k pop superstar then she should be considered korean  in my opinion  hopefully some day  korea will become more open minded and heterogenous in how they define  korean   and i think lisa s popularity is a great move toward that direction  ,1,502,87
this was really adorable  lt 3 cant wait to see them  their english is also sooo good  i am so proud ,1,101,20
and it s crazy cause her accent pronunciation is great ,1,55,8
agreed  no one takes jezebel seriously  they re always trying to make an issue over every little thing to the point that they ve lost credibility  i fully expected the jezebel crowd to take issue with the kpop industry  so this is not surprising or concerning  disregard  also  why isn t the cultural appropritation police calling out nicki minaj for appropriating and disrespecting asian culture  and profiting from it    ,1,423,67
love these people angry about apparent cultural appropriation from kpop groups while hyping up celebrities like ariana grande  they re so hypocritical  they don t have a valid reason to criticize kpop so they use cultural appropriation as a criticism but we all know they re jamming out to white american pop artists without a problem ,1,335,53
but nicki minaj can call herself  chun li  and appropriate asian culture for profit and that s okay    give me a break ,1,119,21
good idea  i think they go on sale local time not sure   i m right down the interstate from you in louisville so i ll probably do the same  go for the atl tickets and if those don t come through  go for the chicago tickets  ,1,224,42
what a worthless article  pure click bait ,1,42,7
what is that long sleeve shirt made of that made it  110  ,1,58,12
yah  i m not a fanboi trashing the site just because they gave blackpink a bad review  we shouldn t talk politics on this sub so i won t  just stay away from jezebel com,1,169,31
i read some comments saying that they can t understand such kind of  pop  music  and then some users just refute them     i mean  it s not like kpop has some ancient korean secret for better pop music  it s pop music  you either like it or you don t      i don t know what to tell you  honestly  there s not going to be fireworks or dragon costumes or dudes doing taekwondo in the background at a colbert show      amp  x200b          that s what kpop is  pop music in korean  if you can accept pop music in the west it s exactly the same kind of thing       amp  x200b  haha  this website made my day ,1,602,108
alright got it  ignore the website and move on thanks for telling me   ,1,71,14
will it be around the same price in europe too  ,1,48,10
totally agree with you  that s probably why yg said blackpink doesn t have the  mental strength  2ne1 did  cl knows how to carry herself  but bp members are still trying to come into their own  personally  i rarely watch interviews of artists i listen to  so their personality means almost nothing to me  i just want the music  i feel like bp can ride that kind of sentiment in at least part of the fandom  they just need to release more music ,1,444,81
if you do javascript w  react native you can have one codebase that works for both phone types it s very cool  ,1,111,21
agreed  i was surprised myself to see those comments from jezebel  but then i haven t visited that site for many years  very disappointed with the negativity but can t be bothered to comment back    ,1,199,34
i can t stand this website ,1,27,5
agreed  haha,1,12,2
jezebel is an old gawker site  and as such can be safely ignored   especially the commentors  it s almost worthless  what s really interesting is i think the root which has some relationship with gawker   gizmodo   univision seems to have some kind of major beef with jezebel  you can see it it the comments on the root all the time  i m guessing the  cultural appropriation  comments are coming from total morons at jezebel who have no sense of what that concept actually means  end rant  sorry i really hate jezebel com  and i m as liberal as they come    ,1,558,99
    the aesthetics of a   [  music video  ]     like the one for ddu du ddu du which includes members hanging off chandeliers and dancing in warehouse engulfed in flames don t necessarily translate to the small stage       amp  x200b  what was more interesting was the comments    a lot of naysayers and claims that they are appropriating and profiting from black culture  claims about south korean s  overt  racism  and general  not impressed  comments  i agree with the commenter who said    music is supposed to be something that brings people from all parts of the world together  it s something that unifies us  and spreads a lot more love than hate      amp  x200b ,1,671,103
i agree with you that fy is just alright     but i think we may be in a minority on that one  lots of people in comments have stated things like  fy was made for stage performances  or  fy is a side worthy   either way  its a perfectly fine song ,1,246,49
really wish they d let them perform some of their older songs  fy is an alright song but i don t think it s the best choice to debut bp to a western audience  after some of the reactions to their dddd performance  which i thought was a pretty solid song for western audiences   i m nervous how people will react to fy  i m just going to stay away from comment sections lol  ,1,374,69
this is why they are the revolution,1,35,7
a fantastic job  nonetheless  ,1,30,4
unfortunately i have no idea how to code for the iphone  only know android programming sorry   ,1,95,17
basically all of them but you need the right ingredients which most groups don t  even if you were a successful group you also need to be signed to an american record label  bp signed with the biggest record company and so all these promotions wouldn t be possible without the clout and connections umg has  ,1,308,54
i wonder how many companies in korea are taking a look at blackpink s incredible success in the us and thinking  i want my groups to be famous like them  ,1,154,29
thank you for making this  will there be a release for ios  ,1,60,12

it would be great if they let us know before hand  i swore to myself that after seeing hyuna i would not go to another k pop concert  it was nothing that she did  the venue itself was fine  but the people managing the event were totally inept  i m hoping it will be different this time ,1,286,55

i think i read somewhere the the general admission flooor tickets include a raffle for some sort of brief meet and greet ,1,121,22
i m thinking the  154 seats look to be the sweet spot  i agree with u paul4allseasons that these tix are pricey  i ve only been to one other k pop concert  i saw hyuna in nyc in 2017  i bought the top ticket which was over  200  but it did include a group photo  any idea of how long the show might be  at these prices i m hoping 2 hours or more ,1,346,69
he s pretty much wrong  she is a chanel ambassador  ,1,52,9
i m wyatt yelling everyone s names ,1,35,5
i m a concert promoter and usually when they only advertise a public onsale  especially livenation since they have the most copy and paste event descriptions  there s usually not any presages going on  however keeping an eye on first ontario s mailing list if they have one might be useful  ,1,291,48
so gma friday  awesome thanks  i almost forgot i have tivo   firing it up for this  i m guessing that the sound and picture quality from cable is going to be way better than from youtube  ,1,188,36

ah this was up before the youtube video  and yeah  that is completely true  people don t click links as much as they just press play on a video ,1,144,28
do the girls have any other schedules in the us now that the late show and gma  and technically their strahan and sara segment  have concluded  i was hoping they would attend nyfw but i guess that wouldn t be the case  if not  i hope the girls get to relax in nyc before flying out to singapore  ,1,296,57
oh man i m kind of nervous for the 20th  really want to be able to get tickets except the demand will probably be high    not sure how into bp our large korean community is  but i m sure the locals in the gta and surrounding areas will be trying to get tickets too  ,1,266,53
lol in the fancams they showed the girls walking out of the building to the car  stop  turnaround and walk back in  i was confused at first but this explains how they needed that shot of them  arriving     there s another fancam showing rosie going all the way inside the van and sitting down lmao  ,1,299,55
you can really see how different north american   western culture is compared to asia   south korea  some asian fans might be freaking out about all the hugging and cheek kissing but hey need to understand that s how things are on this side of the world   now  we don t always do this but it s not weird if it does happen   ,1,324,61
banned is a strong word i guess  they do allow it but you have to buy it there at the concert again,1,99,22
ikr  or gee soh like so many youtubers do lmao  i was pretty impressed that the host pretty much nailed all their names  not that jennie or lisa are hard  but you know what i mean    ,1,183,36
yeah a lot of people are complimenting rosie on how articulate and composed she is during these interviews  she s my bias and i m not used to seeing her receiving so much attention    ,1,184,33
god  they are so cute  ,1,23,5
why is it banned ,1,17,4
the video wasn t up on youtube yet when i posted this but on twitter  i find there is less engagement if ppl are forced to click links so i d rather embed it into the post ,1,172,35
do these views count towards the youtube video  if not  why not just post the original here ,1,92,17
i love when heard that they re speaking english  ,1,49,8
then where does it say she is a chanel ambassador  actually if you follow some other countries  showbiz  cbiz for example  you will quite see the difference between the pr ambassador and chanel ambassador  before getting the  chanel ambassador  title all the celebrities need a  trial period  when they will act as  pr ambassador  for chanel  which means  to constantly post chanel stuff on sns  to wear chanel in their daily life etc etc  this trial period can potentially last for years  and jennie herself is pretty amazing already to get the pr ambassador title when she s still so young into her debut  she has never got the chance to meet personally with karl lagerfield before  had dinner with him etc  so def she is not a chanel ambassador  gd is  take cbiz for example  while we have so many chanel pr ambassadors  there is only one ambassador  zhou xun  sometimes i just wish media will stop calling jennie  chanel muse    chanel ambassador  etc etc because it honestly ain t bringing any good for her    this is no hate  but anyone who knows about fashion world and ranking will knows jennie is not the muse and the ambassador  not yet ,1,1147,199
these are exciting times for them  i m so hyped ,1,48,9
s e l f c a r e p l a n n e r,1,29,15
til  thanks ,1,12,2
i love how supportive jennie is of jisoo speaking english      ,1,63,11
i literally had this argument with someone on another thread yesterday  lisa is definitely so much better at english than anyone knows  but she doubts herself so much  the other members  reaction when she said  a little bit of english  was great  because they knew she was just being shy  she clearly had no problems here  partially because she seemed more relaxed than usual  maybe because it was a game  ,1,406,70
loving the attention they re getting  it s well deserved  ,1,58,8
thais prefer to not display a skill unless they are perfectly confident and are certain they do not impose on their peers  it is a strong cultural trait known as graeng jai  that s why she normally lets the two do the talking ,1,226,42

actually she s not technically a chanel ambassador but  pr ambassador  a slightly lower rank than ambassador  gd for ex   just wonder how she deals with chanel cosmetics now that she already got hera,1,199,33
i heard of it ranging from  67  269  but i also saw another post where a vip payed around  550 to take a pic on stage and see them off,1,134,28

blackpink recorded their segment for the friday show today  friday is actually the pre recording for the avril lavigne episode ,1,127,20
yeah i m in st  louis  also deciding between the two  i think tickets go on sale at separate times  i may go for atlanta and if i dont get that then go for chicago   ,1,166,35
same  5 6 hours from chicago and atlanta so i have to decide which city i want to give my travel costs to  luckily  my car is awesome with gas so getting there shouldn t be a problem     ,1,187,37
i paid 60 for taylor swift   i thought anything more was ridiculous   but blackpink  i have to  plus i live 6hrs from chicago so travel cost added to  it s going to be my vacation this year  ,1,191,36
it s amazing i m considering almost 300 bucks for blackpink  most of the shows i go to range from 20 90 bucks a ticket  i won t even consider a couple of hundred for gaga but blackpink  i m all in  ,1,198,37
i plan to go to that show  it s atlanta or chicago for me  it depends which tix i get my hands on first  atlanta is the preferable choice  ,1,139,28
they re all so cute  lisa speaking english  ahh,1,47,8
seriously it s only 6 seconds and i m being attacked already ,1,61,10
jennie owns red ,1,16,3
 gt  sure jisoo and jennie look a little thicc compared to lisa and rose but i don t know why  they have a higher body fat    yg also seems like one of the normal companies  i doubt they have strict diet  they probably just hold them up to a standard of not gaining too much ,1,275,54
i like to think that jisoo is like   finally  i can just chill    she is usually the mvp with korean interviews talk show segments ,1,131,23
love this,1,9,2
she s always known english and i would say semi fluent  she s just shy  people always assume she s not because of her shyness but you have to remember as well when they first debuted she would never speak in korean  lisa was afraid of making a mistake and said her korean wasn t that great  then later we find out she s super fluent  her issue is always her own self doubt  ,1,374,68
i totally agree  lt 3 and yet  jisoo is so awesome  amp  so funny that she still made her mark  i loved that she voted for herself for the food questions  lol and her  wassup   bit  love her humor  amp  confidence ,1,214,40
doesn t have to be both at the same time  any repeat appearances at colbert is fine especially during the us tour when they are stateside ,1,138,25
if this continues  rose s gonna steal biases left and right  lol,1,64,11
im curious about this too,1,25,5
i know how you feel  the negative comments bum me out too  but i try not to take them to heart  it is hard to imagine people not instantly falling in love with them  but realistically  kpop is still very niche in the us and very much misunderstood by the general public  it s going to take time  the girls will have more opportunities in the future to win people over   ,1,370,71
damnnn rose looks so good   ,1,28,5
congrats girls     even forgetting about the music side of it and just being totally about the money  american broadcasting companies would be incredibly dumb not to have blackpink  amp  other kpop groups on their shows more often  i was talking to my gf the other day about what a waste it was for bts to be at the grammys and not perform  i dont think american companies really understand how large these fanbases are ,1,420,75
i speak 5 asian languages fluently  just wanna say    when we don t purposefully speak in a higher pitch  it just somehow switches on and it s kinda weird turning it off mid conversation  lisa speaking in a deeper voice in the bp house or on vlive is relatable because she s close with the rest of the members  me  my siblings and even my parents they ll speak in a higher tone when we talk to people we don t see often  but if we re talking amongst each other  we turn the high pitched voice off and use our  home  voice  asians are weird,1,539,100
perhaps this time the views come from more non blinks ,1,54,9
i think this should dispel any assumptions that people have about her not being a fluent speaker  from the bits and pieces we ve gotten over the years  her pronunciation and accent have been perfectly fine  she s just shy ,1,222,38
don t believe those sites unless blackpink officially releases the ticket prices or it comes out on ticket master  those sites will rip you off ,1,144,24
viagogo com but we re not sure how reliable it is ,1,50,9
lisa says she only speaks a little english  then continues the rest of the interview in english    ,1,99,18
ros  to lisa  gt you re always eating fried chicken  lisa is a woman of culture ,1,80,14
english lisa    hopefully we can get some more from jisoo soon,1,62,12
jisoo being excited and saying her own name was adorable,1,56,10
theres some up on stubhub too  i wouldn t believe it  i m just hoping to get some pricing info for the show  i wanna know if i can afford ,1,138,28
this is the best thing i have ever seen  i wish it was easier for jisoo to be more included in all this american promo   ,1,121,26
they re adorable  ,1,18,2
where did she get that info,1,27,6
lol jennie was so nervous  when the host asked  why is the us ready for blackpink   her mic picked up her little  oh my god      xd the host probably heard her and that s why she laughed  rosie with the smooth save though     ,1,226,43
they re so adorable     lisa is such a cutie,1,44,9
lol they re all so cute  and rosie and lisa exposing each other  xd lisa  i always have to call you  rosie  you always eat fried chicken  fried chicken    hope we get more environments where it s this relaxed  you can see how much more comfortable lisa is here  ,1,262,47
hands down the most english  it s almost like i m watching a completely different person  i couldn t stop grinning the entire 3 minutes holy moly this video is pure gold for western blinks  ,1,190,33
considering that most musical acts at colbert s barely reach 100k lifetime views  i think this is definitely a milestone for bp ,1,128,21
she is probably self conscious about it  being in a native english speaking country she probably doesn t want to make any mistakes ,1,131,22
so lisa obviously can handle english very well  she s just not confident about it probably because jennie and ros  are more advanced at it  she got the right words out and built sentences with no hesitation throughout the whole thing  ,1,235,40
don t get me wrong  i love me some lisa aegyo too  i guess what i am saying is i love all of lisa   ,1,100,24
i really need this info  my sister is saying  300 for nosebleed seats  newark ,1,78,14
back in 2016  i bet none of the members of bp thought they d be doing a whirlwind promotional tour in the united states  much less being asked to perform at the coachella  ,1,172,32
lisa s english accent  lt 3,1,27,4
i think she purposefully makes it higher in her korean speeches and korean variety  probably directives she got during training  her korean voice is usually the deepest of the group in vlives and bp house,1,204,35
lisa s voice is like honey    when lisa speaks in english her voice is so much deeper  and it makes me feel some kind of way     ,1,129,27
is there anyone she doesn t know  ,1,34,6
i m pretty confident this is the most english lisa has spoken at one time on camera  hopefully even more in the strahan and sara interview on friday ,1,149,27
i mean different places and circumstance and different girls can shine  that is the nice part about blackpink as well  they all have their own strengths  for these english interviews ros  will be the one who is most comfortable  i don t think people forget that tbh  but that s part of what makes her shine here which is awesome to see  ,1,337,60
yea a lot of people were saying rose should be considered the group leader for her boldness in the interview but they forget that she s just comfortable in this western setting but back home she s usually one to take the backseat in variety shows interviews like you said ,1,272,47
this was so cuteee  haha,1,24,5
finally  i ve been waiting for this ,1,36,6
that s fair  it was just curious to me  makes sense tho,1,55,11
ros  is shining so hard in these and it makes me happy  d on korean variety she usually has the harder time  it makes perfect sense ofc  talking in your 2nd language is just different almost no matter how fluent you are  anyway  great interview and a good start to the us promotions   ,1,285,54
i was sad there wasn t going to be an interview but now i m satisfied    ,1,73,15
i m north of atlanta and really want to go  ,1,44,9
well it is not officially announced  it is just yg telling us what the plans are ,1,81,16
lisa speaking english woohoo      ,1,34,4
lmao at all the salty old people commenting on facebook about how blackpink sucks because they couldn t understand what they were singing  like probably because you don t speak korean  lol,1,188,30
her smile tho  ,1,15,4
what s with the periodic screams in the background lmao ,1,56,9
 with their hit new song  da doo da doo ,1,40,9
caption  thank you  goodmorningamerica for having us    we had so much fun        blackpink       on  abc  good_morning_america  gma  us  tv_show_performance  yg [source]  ,1,172,25
caption  one of the pleasant things about working around the world is seeing your friends on a day off   [source]  ,1,115,21
technically no  since those sites promise delivery of the tickets by the event date  not immediately  basically the person you are buying from hasn t bought them yet  but they are going to try to when they go on sale on ticketmaster  that being said  don t trust those sites like your life depends on it if you can score them from ticketmaster  you ll never know if they are going to work until you are at the door on the day of the concert  not saying they can t be legitimate  but the only way to be sure is to buy them from the 1st party seller ,1,548,104
this  exactly  it s not just that not everyone loved the performance    although that s disappointing  amp  i wish everyone had loved blackpink as much as we do    it s how  mean  and nasty people were  the comments about their bodies and appearances  the comments so adamantly arguing they suck  amp  have no talent  i read one jerk say they re  bad role models   lol clearly that person knows nothing about them  i m thankful i didn t read any racism comments because that s even worse    it makes me ashamed to be an american reading comments like that  i want our girls to feel welcome  amp  respected here even more than i want everyone to be new blinks  but hopefully they won t read much of that garbage  like another comment pointed out  they seem to be getting a lot of love on instagram  amp  twitter  so i hope they see the positive reactions    and it sounds like they had fun with the hosts  amp  audiences at both shows  hopefully that was all a positive  welcoming experience   ,1,993,175
i love the girls   ,1,19,5
this is my favorite comment  amp  it makes me feel so much better  lt 3 you d think i would be prepped to expect nasty online comments by now  but somehow these girls are so awesome that i just assumed more people would immediately fall in love with them like i did last summer when i first learned about them  but you re so right    anyone that out of touch  amp  cruel  amp  rude  amp  dismissive  all the people dissing k pop based on one song while admitting they know nothing about it in the same sentence   can suck it  indeed  if people don t want to put in the effort to try something new  it s their loss ,1,614,112
they performed impressively  funny how the announcers struggled with the title of the song ,1,91,14
she s like  just smile and nod  smile and nod  it will pass    haha,1,67,13
the most expensive ticket for rv was like  199  pretty big difference from  280  dont get me wrong  i ll 100  pay whatever   i m just surprised and kind of hoping the venue removed the pricing because it was wrong  also  k con is a bit different   either way its gonna be awesome and i cant wait ,1,296,55
without an interview and barely an introduction i feel like non asian and or non kpop people are just gonna see this and go wtf  people in the other threads were talking about how colbert is better than gma because the audience is younger  but in my eyes gma went over way better and probably actually got americans interested in black pink  the camera work was better  there was blinks there  and the interview established that they can communicate with fans which is very important ,1,484,82
lol  rose and jennie bringing up the sara and michael sticks when the latter two started dancing,1,96,17
anyone know of there are tickets that on sale before general public  like amex does sometimes or certain fan clubs get early access ,1,132,23
they did so good   ,1,19,5
omg i m so proud of theeeeeem   ,1,32,7
rose looks gorgeous in that dress omg,1,37,7
that s actually a perfect comparison  haha,1,42,6
back in the day  it used to be  live to tape   ,1,47,11
anyone know what price range will be  ,1,38,7
when jennie said  just for fun   her face actually turned into that of a 3 year old baby,1,88,18
oh you know just rose speaking english on an american show  lol she really seems the most comfortable so far with interviews  i can t even imagine jennie being nervous but looks like the girls are having fun and enjoying what s only the beginning of a great us tour  also strahan doing the body roll at the end was great ,1,321,59
oh  i see  makes more sense than selling tickets to be an audience member on a commercial tv show  thanks for the info ,1,119,23
with most us talk shows like this you have to apply for a ticket  think of it sort of as an open casting call  the tickets are free but you have to be selected  and for 1iota  the ticketing site for gma  stephen colbert  james corden etc  you have a higher chance of receiving tickets if you fill out your profile with demographic info ,1,336,64
wait    they were selling tickets to be in the audience of a tv show  is that a regular thing on american tv shows  or was this a special occasion ,1,147,29
he s basically america s hiding now  haha ,1,42,6
lol  i was only joking about his record sack against on favre,1,61,12
if you told me that there would be a day where michael strahan and blackpink would be in the same photo like this  i wouldn t believe you  one destroys qbs  the other destroys comebacks  amazing  ,1,196,35
for being as big as he was  he was also fast and had good closing speed    ,1,75,16
nope  no reason  at the time of posting  tickets weren t up for sale on ticketmaster  only axs ,1,95,17
thank god  the conversion would ve been even more deadly lol,1,60,10
so we shouldn t buy it from ticketmaster  is there a reason ,1,60,11
cad same venue,1,14,3
general admission is just standing room only on the floor  so that s why people line up early so they can be closer to the barricade  it seems with vip though you get early entry onto the floor which just means you and whoever else purchased the package can access the floor before regular doors open  that way you can be in the front without having to wait in line to get in or get there early and stuff ,1,405,78
i m a little confused  ticketmaster and axs says the sale is on feb 20th but other sites like stubhub or seatgeek say you can buy tickets now  are those scams or something  ,1,173,32
so much so  they just flopped onto the ground ,1,46,9
i live in lawrenceville  right next to the infinite energy arena  i am definitely going  i also don t have many kpop friends  ,1,126,22
usd or cad  ,1,12,3
like i couldnt imagine a universe where michael strahan and blackpink would know eachother    ,1,94,14
count me in for atlanta  i ll probably fly in for the weekend so if anyone is down to grab a hotel together or knows of a good place to stay hmu  i m 19 m ,1,155,33
yeah  at the end of the day people are going to like what they like and i get that  i m comfortable with the fact that for a large portion of the usa  bp kpop just will never be their cup of tea  the comments i had a problem with were things like  go back where they came from    they look like prostitutes   and others attacking their appearance and nationality   and those mainly came from the baby boomer  crowd  but  that s facebook for you      which is why young folks are fleeing it in droves  luckily  twitter and ig are significantly more relevant in terms of social media presence  and the reactions on those platforms were overwhelmingly positive  and at the end of the day  money talks   as long as the interest in bp continues to generate money  social media hits  viewership  viral songs videos posts  etc  i don t think the big shots in hollywood care if any portion of the nation doesn t ever like them  i think if they have a really strong  well planned comeback  especially if they collab with a big western artist at some point  some more people will come around to them   we just need to be patient and keep our expectations realistic  and of course  we blinks must continue to be supportive by tuning in  liking  sharing  listening  and spreading positivity about them  ,1,1291,228
the face of that cardboard cutout scared many qbs back in his nfl days  he was like a sack master  haha ,1,104,21
what being photogenic is all about  lt 3,1,40,7
during that time me and my friend are gunna be past midterms and just waiting for university offers to come in  i ll see you in hamilton he he he  ,1,147,29
  90s baby  she pumps up the jam   ,1,35,8
they played kiss and make up a lot in the uk too  not sure who dua lipa is signed to  but it would be a good idea for yg to reach out to whoever produced the song and ask them to work with blackpink  ,1,200,44
sadly no rap verse   ,1,21,5
i sometimes forget that strahan is an nfl hall of famer was a feared defensive opponent on the field  he s like a gentle giant now  haha ,1,137,26
killing it       ,1,17,3
that s right ,1,13,2
i may juss be superfanning right now but i coulda sworn blackpink was in new york prior to this performance bcuz i distinctly remember them being in williamsburg   i would know cuz i was living in bushwick at the time which isn t far at all  weren t they here for a fashion show    ,1,282,52
i don t think most people believe she s fluent  but she clearly knows enough to take part in an english interview  in the strahan interview when she answered a question she practically whispered it so i think it s clearly just nerves  there are all kinds of clips on twitter from after the strahan show of her speaking to the hosts and staff in english just fine  i m guessing she s nervous and not confident in her english even though it is sufficient,1,452,80
jisoo is like  why am i still here just to suffer    lol,1,56,12
it s possible  was just curious ,1,32,5
idk if it s allowed to say here but ros  has to start eating  she looks borderline anorexic  i know idols have to be skinny  but this seems too far  but maybe i don t know what i m talking about ,1,195,38
i think they didn t know that yg already told us about the album  maybe they didn t hear the news,1,97,19
sounds fair ,1,12,2
 gt  dude   hit   smacked them all with a kiss,1,46,9
agree to disagree  ,1,19,3
no i wouldn t consider her native either  my mention of native speakers was a compliment of rose saying even native speakers can t speak confidently like that in that type of situation  i know this isn t a fair comparison  although if you want to be a superstar then maybe it is fair and excuses aren t good enough  but if you look at cl in interviews she just oozes charisma and confidence  she is also not a native speaker  but all that aside  if you want to make it big in america you have to have the confidence that you are a star  if you don t then stand next to lisa and jisoo and let rose do the talking  we re making excuses because we re fans but let s be honest  we re not the market for interviews like this  ,1,721,135
well the only thing i could find about vip for the tour was in manila  referring to send off  stand behind barriers and they walk out of the concert and say hi to fans  kind of like red carpet  and soundcheck  not sure  sounds like you get to see the warm up    that sounds like it s different than whatever the other guy was referring to in the other thread  as it was cheaper too ,1,382,73
i m guilty of having repeated that clip over 20x in one sitting previously just for her cute little thai accent lol  but she s 100  reading off of lines in that  ,1,162,30
  i found it  aside from a little hesitancy  i think this is absolutely fine  ,1,78,14
i m pretty sure it s just nerves  i heard an interview on an instagram thing the other day  but it was just audio and she was talking about making the songs or something  i don t even know what it was  but she was absolutely fine  when she s around jennie and ros  she seems to start doubting herself  and asks them if she s saying the right thing  i should also point out here that i m not a crazy ass lisa stan trying to defend her  my ultimate bias is jennie    but i do think i ve heard her speak enough on various videos that she could easily get by in english if she would stop being so doubtful  ,1,603,116
stephen colbert,1,15,2
it s worth noting that jennie really knows how to work a korean audience  it s not surprising that she s the most popular variety show guest among the bp members  she knows what to do with korean hosts and how to respond to jokes in her own witty way  rose however isn t as comfortable in those situations  i think that just shows that jennie is just more comfortable interacting in korean while rose is more familiar doing things in english ,1,442,78
with her proportions  she can wear anything and it will genuinely look good  ,1,77,13
you know it    ,1,15,3
how do the standing work  i ve never understood difference between general  admission and premium,1,97,14
i ve literally watched all of those interviews   and at most she ll say a sentence or two and then let rose or jennie take over explaining  like i said  her pronunciation is near flawless so people mistake her for being fluent but she s just not quite there yet  ,1,263,48
what does vip do ,1,17,4
4 5 hour drive to toronto  here i come      ,1,44,8
i called twice and the first time i got no answer after waiting 30 minutes  second time around i got an answer but no information regarding ticket prices ,1,154,28
no  she s not as fluent as she s gotten in korean  but there are interviews out there where she speaks english absolutely fine  it s definitely 85  shyness  ,1,157,26
 gt dude hit them all you watch your words there fella grrr ,1,60,11
i wouldn t consider jennie a  native  english speaker  she grew up in korea in her early years and had to learn english later  that is a huge disadvantage when it comes to speaking in front of an audience when you have to rely on  muscle memory  while forming sentences in a confident way that you know the audience expects  i ve done a fair share of speaking in front of large audiences  and although i grew up in the u s  speaking english  it s not easy projecting fluency and thoughtfulness on the spot like that  i ve heard jennie speak a lot in interviews and i always noticed she doesn t have the mastery of the english language that someone growing up in the us aus uk would  ,1,683,122
i m looking forward to the proper footage  on all these videos the girls are fully drowned out by the fans      ,1,112,21
they definitely are  i think we just aren t used to seeing them in a western setting ,1,85,16
feel so bad for jennie  she was trying so hard to take some of the interview burden off of rose but she was just too nervous to really say anything substantial  rose though  oh my goodness    carrying this segment by being able to not only answer questions well but managed to joke around and flow with the conversations  so proud of her  to be expected of our aussie native though  also poor jisoo t t it s ok jisoo we all understand your position lol  ,1,454,83
there isnt a lot of stuff jisoo cant pull off ,1,46,10
u humpingjack  your comments are always full of positivity and optimism  ,1,73,10
also going to newark  trying to link up with some blinks   also not your typical kpop fan at all lol ,1,101,21
heh  i m a  slightly  older american that loves bp  i think people just like what they re used to  just like anywhere else  there are way too many musical genres in the us to count  and trust me  different people groups here hate on different musical genres all the time  we americans are completely spoiled when it comes to music because there is soooo much music produced and released here  and so people feel entitled to hate on music that doesn t fit their tastes  it sounds stupid  but that s just what happens  i don t know that the coachella audience will be all that open minded  even the young people tend to be pretty cynical when it comes to the type of music they like  unless bp s set is filled with blinks  i m not so sure they ll get a positive response  i m just hoping that it ll be filled with drunk people who are looking for a fun time  and blinks too  that s the best case scenario     amp  x200b ,1,918,165
hmm i m not so sure  jennie speaks english all the time  rosie was exuding confidence that most native speakers wouldn t have in that situation  i know it s a super short interview but rosie came off as a star and jennie as a shy teenager caught on camera for the first time  i m not trying to hate on jennie fwiw  i m just saying it as i see it ,1,346,67
yes  they did perform  this is the link   ,1,42,8
hell yes it s weird  that s why we re gonna do it right  seriously it s not weird  i m getting two lightsticks ,1,111,19
they killed it  ,1,16,3
i m in the same boat  maybe i ll see you there  lol  ,1,53,11
lisa is definitely not as fluent as everyone thinks she is  the few times she does speak  her pronunciation is very on point so all the blinks think she s a practically flawless english speaker  just shy  but it s pretty evident she doesn t have nearly as firm a grasp on english as she does korea  lisa didn t attend an international school  like sorn of clc who is truly fluent and confident in english  so her exposure to english was most likely from american media and her swiss stepfather  ,1,495,87
yeah i just wanna make sure  like my friends already make fun of me for liking kpop so getting a lightsick i guess is the least of my worries lol,1,145,30
lol i fucking love colbert  ,1,28,5
i guarantee you it s not the audience they re nervous about  it s the english interactions  rose is confident as she was born and raised in aus nz but jennie only studied in nz for a couple of years  and factor in the fact that these girls have been in south korea for the past 6 7 years with barely the chance to really practice their english  ,1,345,63
i love this  i just don t wanna be outta place ya know,1,54,12
just like you mate  i bought the big lightstick as well as the little keychain one  it s definitely not made for 24 year old straight guys but i m still gonna represent for the girls and wave it around during their concert       ,1,229,42
it s not weird at all  if anyone makes fun of you bop them on the head with it ,1,79,18
yeah i was worried about that  however i think the rap parts helped because you could clearly hear the power in their voices during the raps ,1,141,26
man i m with you  they look scary skinny  unhealthy skinny  ,1,60,10
lmfaooooo some of their jokes are more r rated than graham nortons,1,66,11
it looks like vip section is not in the ga standing area  do you guys think vip will be standing or sitting  ,1,109,22
i see  thank you all  i am getting to know what americans think about k pop or even music now ,1,94,19
jennie is naturally skinny and lisa looks muscular in a good way  i am a little worried about rose and jisoo but still  some people are just naturally skinny  i m as skinny as them and i eat way too much  just work out 3 times a week to offset it  maybe i m wrong  if anyone has before after photos then i could see if they ve had drastic weight loss ,1,351,68
i was in that section for bts and the tickets were around 250 after fees and tax  ,1,82,17
yep  fashion is cyclical and apparently skinny jeans aren t  in  anymore but baggy  wide pants are lol  ,1,104,17
yess finally rosie posie s time to shine  they looked so comfortable in this interview  i hope jisoo don t feel so alone there ,1,127,22
thank you sm  ,1,14,3
how we tho  someone should make a gc or something ,1,50,10
they usually give her street style clothes  which currently is going through a 90 s revival  ,1,93,15
yes  see [this]  ,1,17,3
i might get tickets for atlanta and stop by on my way to florida  i ve never heard good things about prudential center so   unless they add a dc show  or even a virginia show  atlanta is my choice so far ,1,204,40
i love watching the graham norton show very much  yet i doubt that bp could quickly and beautifully respond to graham norton s questions lol  but still getting onto the graham norton show would be absolutely great ,1,214,36
so is lisa,1,10,3
i have lived to see lisa [body roll]   on us tv  now i have something to tell my children ,1,90,19
i don t think so  and it s decent pricing for k pop concerts  iirc  k con and big bang were similar in pricing ,1,111,20
i love bp  but these comments were pretty much expected  us is extremely diverse in terms of musical tastes  and bp is never going to be able to scoop up the vast majority of them  yg s strategy is to simply target the ones that have an affinity towards kpop  and there are plenty that will tune in  given the population of asians and young people here  however  i do worry a little bit for them  and i hope the hate racism bp inevitably gets on the boards don t reach them or phase them in any way  ,1,500,95
hmm maybe they took it down  [here s a screenshot]   i took last night ,1,71,13
i m confused  are they not allowed to talk about the album coming out end of march time  i guess it s to protect yg if they can t deliver by then,1,145,29
that s our jichu,1,16,3
gosh i love their outfits  jisoos dress is so cute and unique  jennie s outfit is stylish and very gossip girl  ros s outfit is very ros   mini dresses are so cute  i love them and she pulls them off so well  lisa s outfit is my favorite  i actually like the baggy pants  maybe it s because her outfit looks like something i normally wear  high waisted baggy pants and a crop top   anyway  i love their outfits and would wear every thing the girls are wearing in this picture  ,1,477,87
man   they looked great but the lip sync was terrible,1,53,11
live south of atl but i m coming up  would love to be a part of festivities  ,1,77,16
i saw someone mentioning that black vip in europe was  543  pink was like  270 or something though which wasn t that bad ,1,121,22
idk if i have bad depth perception but i seriously thought that guy at the beginning with the giant clear box was about to drop that right over jennie and sweep her away lol,1,173,34
american s aren t used to seeing artists perform with loud backtracks  especially if you re watching them perform live  i think that s going to be the biggest hurdle for kpop artists coming over  they ll be purely judged by vocal talent alone  especially with shows like the voice being as popular as they are  at least  that s my take  anyways  bp isn t going to please everyone  the important thing is the haters don t drown out the real fans out there  ,1,456,77
it s not cute  if that s high fashion  no ,1,42,8
bp would have to channel their   black   side on the show ,1,58,11
where did yu get this information about vip  is it here on subreddit  ,1,70,13
i think it was also partially because of the volume of the blinks  so far there s no official video of forever young  as far as i can tell they did it for the later show with the interview  but the fan videos of it are almost inaudible because of the fans  i reckon the backing track is cranked up to drown out the fans  ,1,321,64
omg jennie was so nervous i just want to hug her,1,48,11
yaaaay  it was already fun watching the preview and there s a longer version coming    my heart   plus it looks like they recorded forever young for the later show  ,1,165,29
ouch  i m not sure how much the general american audience is going to like kpop after watching this  they have a hard time with performers who sing overtop the vocals of their own songs  and sometimes lip sync   just look at ashlee simpson ,1,240,43
no way  dude hit them all  i only don t see rose getting any love  but only because that was pre video recording  you can see in the first second he is pulling away from lisa and then off screen does like two moves with jisoo  i don t want to get all technical because now i feel like a creep  he did it presumably to all of them ,1,330,66
it s probably because blackpink is still  new   when i say new i mean new to people in the us who don t listen to kpop  give it time  blackpink will rise in popularity and maybe next time we ll get a longer interview ,1,217,41
to be honest  i was disappointed at how loud the backing track was on gma  i could still hear their voices  but just barely  one of the reasons i enjoyed the colbert performance was because the backing track was low so their voices really stood out   and they sounded great  so i don t understand why they cranked the backing track up so loudly for gma  i guess just because it was a live performance vs colbert was pretaped  but still  ,1,437,81
bts went on there  but i see what you mean  doesn t necessarily have to be r rated  maybe on  this morning  then with holly and phillip  ,1,137,25
i watch the preview for the strahan and sara show  if someone can post it  lisa finally speaks and her first word is hotdog  lol ,1,129,25
it s on jam fm for month now  only reason i sometimes listen to the radio xp,1,76,16
he only kissed jennie    ,1,25,5
what are they  i couldn t find anything lol,1,43,8
graham norton seems a little too r rated for them though  not sure yg would want to associate them with that image just yet ,1,124,23
bts had been to unicef  and performed at the bbmas  there was a lot on their radar compared to a simple us tour ,1,112,23
hopefully they get onto the graham norton show when they come to the uk  ,1,73,14
this is hilarious lmao ,1,23,4
not to raise an issue  but aren t jennie and rose pretty westernized ,1,69,12
i personally dislike the matchy outfit thing that k groups do so this is right up my alley  also it s not that the stylists don t realize lisa looks so out of place  that s most likely their intention  ,1,202,36
michael strahan with the temple kiss hug combo power move  that lucky son of a ,1,79,13
           ,1,11,4
oh no michael strahan doing the body roll   ,1,44,9
atlien here  100  going  my wallet is going hate me even though i warned him this would happen eventually  i need info on the vip stuff soon  because it s sounding like  500   so much for going to the stray kids concert in ny the next week lol ,1,244,47
jisoo  went  off   ,1,19,4
uk top range vip was  417  so whether or not they ll be roughly the same or reflect the currency difference is debatable    the other rough ticket prices do look pretty similar though  mine were  85 each for seated tickets  but watch out for the fees because i had to pay an extra  25 or something  ,1,299,55
on fri 15th,1,11,3
yes  this is only a preview ,1,28,6
so is there going to be a longer version of this later  then  ,1,62,13
this is exactly the kind of interview i am longing for     i hope jisoo said something too,1,90,18
so jealous of those hugs     ,1,29,6
the girls look amazing as usual ,1,32,6
did they actually perform  the clip doesn t show it  ,1,53,9
lisa finally said something  this looks like it will be a fun interview ,1,72,13
they weren t lipsyncing  you could clearly hear their voices over the backing track  i don t think people are really used to backing tracks being used that way though  particularly in kpop they keep the vocals fairly loud so that if the girls want to stop for a breath or something  the song will keep going  but they were still really audible over the top  ,1,358,64
it s also posted on the show s [youtube]  ,1,42,7
lisa spoke english before she spoke korean  it s less that she s learning and more that she s just shy of speaking it in front of people  ,1,138,25
happy to know that ty  ,1,23,6
jennie got so shy   ,1,20,5
this is amazing  but i hope jisoo gets some attention on her in the full thing  ,1,80,16
source  [ ,1,10,2
lol did someone say  where s the pizza  ,1,40,7
honestly tho lmao ,1,18,3
rosie seemed very confident and eloquent to me  jennie    not so much    honestly pretty surprised  i know it s a huge audience but they ve been doing things in front of big audiences for quite some time now ,1,208,36
the target demographic for good morning america is old retired folks who are out of touch  that generation in america is very narrow minded  for that reason  gma probably was not the best platform for a kpop group trying to make a first impression in the us  some of the comments are disgusting and rude  but not unexpected given the average gma viewer  notice the negative comments are mostly old people   coachella on the other hand is targeted towards a younger  more hip  more open minded crowd   i m certain bp s reception at coachella will be much more positive ,1,568,99
maybe it s just her body type  i know people like who are that thin  ,1,69,14
in fact the  bodyshaming  comments are kind of expected  especially reddit users in this community haha  asians generally glorify skinnier bodies  at least in hong kong lol   and i am quite surprised by those reactions too,1,222,36
i regret opening that link   so many disrespectful comments  makes me glad i don t have fb  ,1,92,16
ugh  i wish i hadn t looked  some of those comments are downright cruel    but all the negative comments are from super old people who are out of touch anyway  so it doesn t concern me too much  not everybody in america is going to be receptive to bp kpop in general  especially the older generation  and that s ok  i applaud our girls for being so couragous and bringing their best  all those rude old people can suck it  ,1,423,77
forever young fancam  [source]  ,1,32,4
damn i just saw it wow these reactions r kind of more negative than i expected  i mean of course i expected alot of backlash and negativity but damn  also were they really lipsyncing  i thought they had a backup track and sang with it  also i know that body standards r diff in every country  but why is everyone bodyshaming them  like is not america always talking about body positivity and how every type and size of body is beautiful  i get that they thought bp was being starved to death  but is not it rude to make assumptions without an actual proof  damn now i dont know what to expect from coachella,1,607,114
i m live in charlotte so i ll be flying in lol  right  i saw that  idk why most of the concerts are mid week  it s so odd  ,1,123,26
lord i wish they d shut up about that  this performance was strong ,1,67,12
im 100  going ,1,14,3
the general public  basically those who watch gma regularly i think  [facebook source]   usually they say  autotune    talentless    too skinny    lip sync    something like that  of course many blinks also commented there  but you can notice those negative comments as many users reacted to them ,1,297,45
jisoo s hips tho  her body outline really is amazing  but all of them have pretty bodies,1,88,16
are they in madame tussaude s ,1,30,5
most american tv appearances for music groups only get 1 song at the end of the show  snl is the only one i can think of that usually does 2 and it splits them up  ,1,164,35
jisoo reminds me of v here  not shipping them chill  while the interview is literally happening and being recorded in front of a whole audience  they r both in their own worlds and just being the weirdly adorable cuties they r ,1,227,41
it definitely seems like rose and jisoo dropped like 10 pounds between blackpink house and square up promotions  i think they both look a little too thin but jennie and lisa look okay  i just hope it s their choice to be that thin and not being pushed by yg  ,1,259,49
ms chichu and a little black dress r the iconic duo im telling yall,1,67,14
life s good he wen t from being the all time in single season sacks to spending time with blackpink which is a pretty good way to go,1,132,25
these four cutie pies r soooo adorable ughhh  amp  x200b ,1,57,9
they re so cute  you can tell everyone was enamored   ,1,54,10
really   from the general public or from the kpop community or blinks ,1,70,13
i m sorry  chichoo  i had to ask ,1,33,7
i really really don t want to drive to atl because it s awful    but i guess i ll just suffer through it for the pay off  i really wish they were doing this tour during the summer  doing it around the time of finals is kind of bad planning on the organizers  parts  also  they aren t doing any of these tours near enough communities of asian americans  they should have at least 2 concerts in california  ,1,405,73
thank you  this is what i was thinking fearing ,1,47,8
there are lots of mixed reviews on facebook  i really hope they could do good eventually ,1,89,16
anyone can gain lose weight  it s just difficult because the amount of food we think we need to add subtract is way less than the actual effective figures  so when we try to eat more or less  there s little to no change  what is really needed to kick the change off is exaggerated additions subtractions to food intake ,1,319,55
yep  weight management is really just simple math  you gain weight if you get more calories than you lose  and lose if it s the opposite ,1,137,25
i love how they blended so well with the western and their customs ,1,67,13
yea the problem is they re doing it on a weekday in tx and i m taking my teen  so i prefer she loses only one school day instead of two    never been to atlanta before so that should be quite the experience lol  do you live there  i d appreciate any recommendations ,1,266,51
i watched it  they were so good  as always  what legends ,1,57,11
i cant wait  they are going to be so close to me in chicago  got my light stick ready  ,1,87,20
if you re in mexico wouldn t it be more ideal for you to go to the one in texas then    unless you juss rather the arena in atl for your preference  either way i m down  ,1,170,35
let s be real here  nobody is gonna agree with you haha  but it s definitely true they are forced to be skinny slim it s the reality there no denying  i know this is a different company  but wendy from red velvet    during red flavor days she was so skinny and her face got so skinny it was extremely obvious  it was almost dangerously skinny  people were outraged like why are they starving her  they can tell from rookie to red flavor something happened  and during peekaboo and bad boy she gained weight and looked great  her face didn t look like she had the life sucked out of it  there was literally a video of wendy eating ice cream and her manager was looking at her  off camera  kinda telling her she should be eating that  and the girl from girls generation said to the manager  let her eat       don t tell me these companies have ethics and value people over money  they do what gets them money  sure jisoo and jennie look a little thicc compared to lisa and rose but i don t why  everything is done to these girls from hair  clothing  body size things they say  etc for a reason  it s not like they go around telling us  because that would make them seem like the enemy  sure on blackpink house they showed rose eating left and right  but they could ve wanted you to see that she eats so nobody would make all these accusations that they starve her or make her diet 24 7  again there is a reason for everything  i love these girls and their personality and they re beautiful   but don t go around saying they have the choice to do this and that  ,1,1559,285
even the host   stephen like ellen just go along the ride for extra ads money and aren t too enthusiastic about korean group  ,1,126,23
how so ,1,7,2
i m in mexico and want to go  depends if i can get tickets ofc  i just hope it doesn t sell out too quickly   if it s a fairly big venue i guess it should be ok do you think  i agree on the group ,1,196,43
this pic is how i feel about this post it s perfect,1,51,11
i think i remember that one hahaha  they do have big appetites ,1,63,12
will do,1,7,2
i think jennie in general is shy  but her performance is always the opposite  it s kind of a nice surprise  i d like to hear from lisa and jisoo  but i know they re still learning  it s too much pressure to talk on national television  so i hope they don t get pressured to do so  ,1,281,53
fast metabolism is a myth  they simply eat enough calories to sustain themselves  they don t overeat  ,1,102,16
indeed  they haven t been sick ever  i think  which is good  ,1,61,11
probably just nervous  we d also been standing out in the cold   eventually snow for like 3 4 hours at that point   ,1,116,22
dude  i m here waiting for season 2  yes  i know they have big appetites  i m just just suggesting that maybe it isn t to hard to imagine the look conscious management to still be putting them on restrictive diets  if that s not the case  then i m glad  maybe i should ve been more specific  i m more concerned with lisa and rose  ,1,331,58
i love how lisa s fashion always seems like it s straight from the year 2001,1,76,14
i m just so overwhelmed haha  so many emotions at once  i m so proud of them  they ve done so well this trip  gah nervous jen jen  someone give her a hug  american blinks made them feel welcomed  that s what i was hoping for  ,1,226,42
the girls were asked on one of the idol shows if they dieted before a comeback and the said yes  when asked how many meals a day they were down to they said 3    with snacks ,1,174,36
yes jisoo does look to be in a healthy weight  it could be that they re all naturally thin  in which case that s good  as long as they re eating fine  and when i say this i mean they re not being put on crazy diets  then all is well ,1,233,47
keep telling yourself your opinion is valid ,1,44,7
  having a valid opinion and question is wrong  wanting to discuss something that may be important is wrong  ,1,109,19
thanks  i m not counting out the fact that lisa s always been thin  that makes sense ,1,85,15
but can i say how happy i am for bp  this exposure  experience  and just how awesome they are doing ,1,100,20
thanks for this  don t get me wrong  i m not hating on skinny people  i m not telling anyone to do anything with their bodies except to strive to achieve the healthiest they can be  ,1,182,33
i just hope whatever they are eating has the proper nutrition they need to perform and stay healthy  once the north american and euro part of the tour kicks off they got work to do ,1,181,35
i m not saying there s anything wrong with being naturally skinny  if that s how your body really is  i m not saying they re not beautiful  that s exactly why i wanted to discuss this  to see what people think about the situation  to share their opinions ,1,255,43
they split the interview up  they have another one for  sara  amp  strahan  which is the afternoon hour of gma  ,1,112,20
do you even black pink house    the girls are quite short in height but they still look proportionate  how can you think jennie needs to eat more when she s got the most marshmallow cheeks  have you seen jisoo s legs lately they re thicc er  ,1,242,42
exactly this  i think she looks great,1,37,7
they performed on the second floor so we could only watch from the big screen outside of gma  and yeah  everyone who had a  general admission  ticket was turned away except for those few people who were lucky enough to do the quiz segment  ,1,240,44
they ll get better over time with more interviews  their nervousness makes them look genuine and endearing  ,1,108,16
we can care about multiple things  lmao,1,39,7
couldn t you see through the window  so you re sayin u got a ticket but wasn t allowed in  ,1,91,17
it was so surreal seeing them on my tv instead of my computer or phone screen lol  i m glad they are getting world recognition  i just worry that the american demographic will be too critical of them tbh  still  i m so happy they re out of the dungeon  ,1,253,47
this is not a north american tour it is a us tour ,1,50,12
good catch  i m usually watching rose so i didn t even catch it  i m glad she didn t  she would ve been super embarrassed  the fans wouldn t have made a big deal about it though    ,1,181,33
lisa used to have more meat on her when they debuted but ros  has always been very skinny  i do wish they would both gain a few pounds  mainly because it looks like you can do doubleshots out of their collarbones if they were laying down  i honestly think jisoo and jennie are perfect  jisoo is my thic queen ,1,309,59
yes  this friday  15th ,1,23,4
i m happy for the girls and they did great today   it was also fun to meet blinks at the event  i was pretty disappointed by how the ticketing was handled though  only people with priority tickets got in  the people who were chosen for the quiz were at the front of the ga line  they let about 20 of us do the shot where you see blackpink  arriving  at the pink carpet so it was really cool to see them up close for a few minutes but i still wish i d been able to see them perform  they oversold by probably about 50 tickets so a lot of people stood out in the cold for nothing  some didn t even get to go into the pink carpet thing ,1,633,127
hopefully they were not to embarrassed by the hugging  you know what koreans are like for manner hands ,1,103,18
they were visibly nervous  but still a great north american debut for them between this and the late show  i am so hyped to see them in concert ,1,144,28
you re getting down voted but you re probably right  most of his audience are older  and probably aren t interested in black pink no matter how well they perform  ,1,163,27
you already lose the race because you re gonna be online the second it goes on sale  need to be there the millisecond it goes on sale    ,1,137,27
damn jennie,1,11,2
do they not eat normally  do we know how or what they eat  we don t exactly  we only have assumptions  so far  lisa and rose do not look unhealthy to me despite being skinny  jenny is thick and sexy  jisoo looks fine ,1,217,42
then they come to the netherlands and its so expensive  ,1,56,10
y all downvoting this comment when they have a point and aren t even attacking anyone  everyone else went for a more feminine vibe while lisa went for a more girl crush  which is fine but the colors throw it off in terms of group harmony  ,1,239,44
i agree  she pulls the outfit off amazingly  buy she also looks like she might just be a backup dancer  they should have at least matched colors  i understand they were going for that hip hop feel,1,196,37
whats wrong with you,1,20,4
can t sit there,1,15,3
as a person who has been as thin as they are my whole life i can guarantee you they eat lol they just have very fast metabolisms on top of the fact that they re constantly performing practicing which makes them burn more calories  ,1,231,42
they only performed dddd,1,24,4
it probably has to do with yg limiting the questions they can ask the girls and wanting the  interview  to stay on the topic of their tour,1,138,27
my wife is as skinny as lisa and eats constantly  some people are like that  ,1,77,15
you could ve gotten your point across without coming across as inflammatory statement  what you said is highly subjective  let s just leave it at that  ,1,152,24
thanks to blackpink that blinks watch the whole news and even learn about storms coming to ny  a truck accident etc ,1,116,21
i really hope they do the girls justice with a nice interview for their friday show which is probably taping today i d imagine  ,1,128,23
jisoo almost tripped at the 3 04 mark  fortunately she was able to keep her balance,1,83,15
she had her mind right set on that stage lol such a cutie pie,1,61,14
that quiz for the golden ticket tho    were they really blinks or just super nervous  people sometimes have their mind go blank under pressure  haha  feel kind of bad for them  ,1,177,31
i wanted to hear lisoo at least say a single world but oh welp jennie and rosie s exotic accents and cute and nervous laughs make up for it ,1,140,28
she had to avoid getting crushed beneath those balloons ,1,56,9
poor jennie lol she s like internally in panic mode xd,1,54,10
well it s been a political talk show for the past three years so at this point i think it s pretty set in stone  ,1,113,23
now this was a little unfair  when bts goes on they have a 5 minute sit down interview  and bts only has one english speaker  i am a fan of gma and most of the performers interviews are longer than 5 minutes  ,1,209,41
yes  she was too nervous  i think she forgot to mention some important details about the tour lol,1,97,18
newark for me as well ,1,22,5
i don t know if i m even in my right mind or not but the dude looks like a cardboard cutout   ,1,94,20
we get an awesome performance and all you guys seem to care about is how you don t like lisa s outfit  smh,1,106,21
no but  i neeeeeed to know ,1,27,6
performance [link]  ,1,20,2
i don t think it looks bad or anything  she looks great  but the colours and theme don t fit the other 3 outfits  honestly  for outsiders it might look like she isn t even in the same group x ,1,192,37
yes  it was live  gma just uploaded the interview on youtube [ ,1,63,12
it was all live yes,1,19,5
is it live ,1,11,3
thank god she didn t say rojay lmao,1,35,7
the interview is too short for me    and they can t even sit down to take this interview,1,88,17
what is the grey  ,1,18,4
jennie super nervous lol  rosie so used to speaking for the group she s always composed ,1,88,15
the interview session is way too short     ,1,43,7
am i the only one who actually likes lisa s outfit  it makes her stand out so much and highlights her tomboyish style ,1,118,22
i m planning on going but it all depends on my exam schedule and transit   ,1,75,15
unfortunatelly they always do that,1,34,5
they are slaying again,1,22,4
doesn t matter what you look like  black pink is the revolution,1,63,11
if i ve learned one thing this week    on other social media platforms  i have zero kpop and jpop friends  ,1,107,19
bts played the same arena  maybe acc is full and or they re still feeling out the market by going  smaller  with hamilton ,1,122,21
lisa s outfit is so out of place compared to the rest       who dressed them today,1,82,16
saw bigbang there  i am ready for blackpink ,1,44,8
i dunno what jisoo is wearing but damn she pulled it off really well,1,68,14
lisa s pants  how does she constantly pull everything off like that damn,1,72,12
reverse blacked ,1,16,2
as soon as i saw this last night i booked a hotel room   it may be a 5 1 2 hour drive from where i am but that s okay ,1,118,29
too true,1,8,2
jisoo just walking straight ahead  ,1,35,6
also a dude here   and not your typical looking either  they just finished their concert here on our country last week  and i was not able to attend because tickets were sold out fast  and also im a fairly new fan at the time of ticket selling  became their fan just this october  and i thought  i m not blink enough to attend  so i didnt really made any effort to look for tix until last week of january came and i couldnt find any more legit sellers  biggest regret so far lmao  i d say go for it  what ever it takes  don t hesitate  my friend told me its super worth it ,1,573,111
i know  she s always been skinniest but lately i ve had the same worries  for someone who loves to eat it certainly doesn t show   jisoo and jennie both have the perfect weight in my opinion  jisoo especially looked sexy as hell in this performance ,1,249,43
oooph they were so nervous  jisoo and jennie both looked like they were going to throw up  it might have just been bad timing with the camera getting them and cutting away too fast  vocals on point though ,1,205,38
i have work at 7am the next day  and i ll be coming in from nyc as well  i ve also been anticipating their concert ever since they announced a world tour so i ve been budgeting for them  bc yes their tickets will be expensive  but everything is going to be so worth it  it s a once in a lifetime opportunity and i have no doubt in my mind that i m going to have an amazing time  they rarely come here  i m also ecstatic that they rented a huge venue bc they are going to 100  sell out  i prefer msg as well  but as long as bp are coming to the tri state area  i am not complaining  ,1,582,117
oof  and you know stans are gonna stand outside for hours to get near the stage in ga  for those of us who cant take 2 days off work  ga may be untenable compared to the lowest rows of the bowl  will wait to see chicago s seating chart ,1,236,48
if red velvet can sell out in toronto in 5 minutes i think blackpink will be able to sellout in hamilton  ,1,106,21
when any venue is at least like 500 miles from your house ,1,58,12
where can i watch the show  now  i passed out too early   ,1,58,13
rose looking a bit on the dangerous side of thin lately d ,1,58,12
when s the next time you ll get to see bp  you can always retake a class,1,72,15
i m trying to decide if i want to go to chicago vs atlanta  ,1,60,13
one of their best d4 performance i could say,1,44,9
which date are you going to  i m in the same situation but i m going to shows 98  of the time alone   amp  x200b ,1,113,22
i jumped on here to check for a live vid of last night  i watched it live  i saw your post and thought i d have to watch the gma performance after the fact  i forgot i work from home today  i don t care what they sing on gma but i do hope they pick one other song   d,1,267,58
with lower supply and the same demand it is true that prices go up  especially if you have to buy tickets from scalpers  however  it costs a  lot more money to have a concert in an arena than in a small concert hall  renting the venue  tech  staging  staff  insurance  everything costs way more  the face value ticket prices can be cheaper  but not drastically  the kcon ny 2018 tickets were 50 100 150 for one night of a two night arena show  the redmare tickets are 69 89 129 169 199  so more  but not drastically more  relatively speaking  i m used to going to metal shows with  20 or less general admission even when the band comes all the way from europe to a really small place  that s what a concert should be  something you can just go to on a whim for a good time  like a movie  and not be too upset if it s lame  the thing is at a metal show you don t really need to see very much  just gotta hear  at a kpop show there is dancing to watch  being close to the front suddenly matters  even the cheapest seat in a theatre you can usually see the stage pretty well  that cheap seat in the arena  you may as well just go home and watch fan cams since you ll be looking at a video screen the whole time anyway ,1,1215,230
at such an insane price  it had best include something crazy like backstage passes ,1,83,14
i was waiting for them to come on   i passed out around 12 22   i have to be up at 7am  if only i could have lasted another 8 mins  ,1,132,31
black vip in berlin is like 534  so probably more then  500  pink vip was 364  tho ,1,83,17
any idea where i can watch the whole thing  or did they only do a single performance ,1,85,17
for europe the vip tickets took longer to sell out  as they are significantly more expensive  black vip went up to 535  and last i looked for the berlin show everything   but   vip was sold out,1,193,36
they all look happy at the end but look at the smile on jennie shes so happy  great job girls now you re about to kill it again on gma  ,1,136,29
our rich queens,1,15,3
i think it s one of the best live performances i ve seen yet  perfect way to bring the new generation of female kpop to the us  i hope they start a trend of more talent coming here  more than just k con ,1,203,40
are there any fan meetups for this show ,1,40,8
i wish boston    ,1,17,3
maybe just anti s but yeah  it s the most obviously live performance i ve seen  and one of the best ,1,100,18
don t even think about not going  i can t even tell you how many awesome experiences i ve missed out in because i was worried about going alone  especially with concerts  once the music starts everyone is just a huge crowd  the most fun i ve had at a music festival was when my friends left me because they weren t interested in the artist that was playing  ,1,358,64
i m going the manchester show and been thinking the same but just thought fuck it it s probably a couple more years before any of the other groups i like do a world tour and who knows if and when blackpink will be back in my area   thanks to everyone s reassuring reply s to this too btw     ,1,292,57
weid time to say this considering how clearly you could hear them  the playback was much lower there than during their dddd promotion in korea last year  ,1,154,27
would you consider lisa as korean not kpop artist   but a korean celebrity person  please explain your yes or no  ,1,114,18
there ll be an ep album and new solo song before then  thank you  next excuses ,1,79,15
the slayage begins  ,1,20,3
no worries   ,1,13,3
do they each get colbert souvenir mug  ,1,39,7
diversity hire  black and male  ,1,32,5
she didn t wear this for the performance  wonder what it was for ,1,65,12
stephen colbert is the 5th member of blackpink confirmed,1,56,9
colbert political audience probably switch channel during bp performance  wonder what s the viewer rating for bp ,1,113,16
toxic youtube comments saying they lipsynced     ,1,49,7
a prominent kpop artist who doesn t like loud noises  that s hilarious  that s like a scuba diver with thalassophobia ,1,118,18
how certain are we that they re really over and it s not just some cover up  ,1,77,15
thought it was elon not gonna lie,1,33,7
75  blackpink   let s all wear skirts and not tell lisa   great performance by all of them  ,1,92,16
hahahah  i should ve put up a warning  jennie was like   hit you with that   and i think she hit you with that   ddu,1,116,23
exactly  you are very fast  i uploaded it again lol,1,51,10
with subtitles ,1,15,2
i did not expect that holy dhiimj,1,33,7
i m a bot  bleep  blop  jk     ,1,31,8
wow  you posted this 2 minutes after the actual video was uploaded  i applaud your dedication ,1,94,16
you were fast getting it up ,1,28,6
amazing  proud of them ,1,23,4
i m crossing my fingers for no higher than  500,1,47,9
just wanted to give another thanks to stephen colbert sunbaenim for hosting our girls  really great performance  can t imagine how many new fans they ve gained tonight and will gain after gma tomorrow morning ,1,209,33
just want to say thank you to stephen colbert sunbaenim for hosting our girls  the performance was great  can t wait for gma tomorrow morning   ,1,144,24
190212 because their performance was aired at around 12 30am est  even though the show began at 11 35pm est  us tv debut     check gma next  and have a nice day blinks ,1,168,32
i m guessing  350 400 range for the higher tier vip packages ,1,61,10
damn  269 for general admission    that is insane  i wonder what vip will be,1,76,14
caption  we really enjoyed the show tonight   colbertlateshow how was it everyone  thank you ny for the warm welcome and thank you so much blinks for coming out to support us despite the cold weather  ,1,201,35
look at what lisa and jennie are holding  i think we do get an interview ,1,73,15
okay you already know when they play solo we be doing her dance right lol,1,73,15
hi ill go with u im a guy too who doesnt look like your typical kpop fan but i love bp   p,1,90,22
thank you  i plan on calling axs tomorrow and see if i can get any scoop for that event  i ll drop by and let you know what i find ,1,131,29
that s the one i m planning on going to but the event isn t listed on their website yet  ,1,89,17
are you able to find chicago prices  ,1,37,7
my baby looking extra wonderful for their performance  ,1,55,8
dude  once you enter a kpop concert  whatever you look like doesnt matter  it feels so great to be with other kpop fans because no one will judge you whether you look like or not look like a typical kpop fan  no such thing even exists  so dont worry about it  being with fellow kpop fans is like breaking your shell and just scream your inner kpop out  ,1,353,68
found this on infinite energy centers website ,1,46,7
look at eu prices for barcelona  london  and manchester for estimates ,1,70,11
anyone know estimated prices ,1,29,4
an even more epic crossover than avengers or jl,1,47,9
dont twist my words  i said they re not the strongest  which is true  or do you believe they re better than lets say bts  exo or mamamoo  being objective about their level of performance isn t hate  but reality ,1,211,37
does powerhouse sell tickets ,1,29,4
more than winners for sure  i ve heard the price is outrageously high but still not going to stop me for going haha,1,115,22
hate is going to come no matter who you are  especially in us music scene where discrimination runs rampant  i do take issue with your insistence that bp is poor at live performance  are we watching the same group  to me this just sounds like hate  ironic coming from someone who don t like bp hate  ,1,300,55
feb 20 at 4pm for general public,1,32,7
i m reallyhoping soo   ,1,23,3
maybe they ll announce more dates later ,1,40,6
i see  just wait for the official youtube thing  i believe the views will be crazily skyrocketing again lol,1,107,19
her hair flip as she prepared to spit fire  it had me dead ,1,59,13
anyone know where i can stream this ,1,36,7
they did very well on colbert live singing ,1,43,8
american broadcast probably not allowed  they re more strict on that kind of stuff ,1,83,13
yes    would like to ask you why too  ,1,38,8
i think this reddit post got removed b c of piracy rule   i don t see it on the frontpage ,1,90,17
yeah my dude it s weird at first with all the screaming girls  not gonna lie  but once the show starts you get used to it  saw winner by myself in chi  go for it  ,1,163,34
anyone is going from wisconsin  try to find a ride here    ,1,59,12
[  this includes colbert s introduction ,1,40,5
yeah   fellow leafs fan   ,1,26,5
colbert doesn t do musical interviews  i think gma will interview them  i hope ,1,79,13
nah kpop companies just plan super last minute while western artists book venues months even a year in advance    there s only so few arenas out there and the acc in toronto has sports playoffs going on around that time    for most of the dates  either it s on a weekday or the location isn t great  this reflects how the tour planning wasn t the greatest    trust me if they could they would play toronto  it s just so much easier especially since they will be staying there  ,1,477,84
i agree  they looked so tired  they need a better balanced schedule  ,1,69,12
i felt their outfits were maybe not the best choice  their coordination was all over the place  if they used the outfits they wore to their dddd comeback stage it would have left a better overall impression  ,1,208,37
well  we ll come visit you again next week   ,1,45,9
hope next time the girls will be invited for a performance and an interview ,1,76,14
well  at least we can all agree on one thing    blackpink      ,1,63,12
they are    they re going to hamilton  ontario  ,1,48,8
isn t hamilton in ontario  ,1,27,4
i m a guy and have been to a bunch of concerts by myself  including some pop ones  not kpop though  as soon as the music starts and people are jumping  no one cares about the people around you  you should definitely go ,1,219,42
me and my sister from ottawa are going still haven t decided on the method of transportation  might take the train or friend s car if they decide to go ,1,152,28
i haven t watched a late show in a looong time  but music guests rarely ever got interviewed  ,1,94,17
the girls were on fire and jisoo   just   wow  she s trying to kill us all ,1,75,13
i think this show had an extra dose of it because john oliver was the guest and that s his main role  ,1,102,21
that was awesome  jennie with that energy ,1,42,7
exactly     ,1,12,2
they did so good    i really hope theyre able to get more opportunities for us tv appearances after this ,1,105,20
they re protecting them at all costs finally   ,1,47,8
i m sorry but they seemed so    unenergetic tonight  especially jennie  she looked bored and didn t seem to much effort ,1,120,19
ok jennie s rap had me shook she really delivered ,1,50,9
check out [ colbertlateshow]   it s pretty much a blackpink stan account now ,1,77,11
awesome  let s get the tickets first  as my roommate just told me ,1,66,12
not the late show is not a political talk show  the colbert report is the political show he was on  late night with david letterman was not nearly as political as it is now ,1,173,34
colbert must be enjoying their performance very much ,1,53,8
nice to find some nhl fans in here  even if i dislike both teams    go leafs go ,1,80,18
u humpingjack  you da mvp  ,1,27,5
as someone in a very similar situation to you  do it  i went to a c e alone and had a great time ,1,97,21
6 dates doesn t have me that confident that the prices will be reasonable but i m going to do everything in my power to go to that atl or chicago date  ,1,152,30
\ blackpinkonlssc now trending no 1 on twitter worldwide  it feels so surreal ,1,78,11
holy crap  thats pricey  do the floor tix include a meet and greet ,1,67,13
as a flyers fan  i m not as excited about the first part of that    ,1,68,15
february 20th,1,13,2
they go so hard  they control time   ,1,37,8
i d like to  i just went to see red velvet alone and it wasn t as fun by myself  so i don t wanna do it again for blackpink  ,1,125,27
i felt the opposite  i felt like they sang more parts that they usually leave the backing track  plus  they actually turned up their mics so you could hear them  ,1,162,30
any word on when they go on sale  ,1,34,8
there dancing was so powerful the song felt sped up,1,51,10
a lot of people did  but they never interview the music guest on the late show  the will get interviewed tomorrow morning on gma    ,1,132,25
bts s only canada dates were 3 days in hamilton  i m starting to wonder if korea just thinks hamilton is the capital of canada,1,126,23
yeah you re right lol  looks like he s in the clear,1,51,10
jisoo proving her visual title  haha  ,1,38,6
ah    the pens beat the flyers  and bp had a phenomenal first us performance  what a great night  ,1,98,18
seriously  they even sang the parts they usually leave to the backing track  everyone was spot on the whole time  ,1,114,21
no pacific north west      no vancouver love ,1,45,8
it would look so beautiful ,1,27,5
i think he shook her hand first,1,31,7
conan bias here ,1,16,3
ros  s stage presence was phenomenal  the way she sang danced and looked into the camera with those eyes      ,1,110,19
i was underwhelmed with the crazy amount of lip syncing especially with the chorus  but i guess it s due to the limitation of a talk show stage ,1,144,27
was i the only one under the impression that they were also gonna be interviewed ,1,81,15
they sounded so freaking good ,1,30,5
he shook all of their hands except jisoo i hope people don t give him slack for that haha,1,89,18
um wow  that was absolutely phenomenal  i am speechless  they nailed it  so glad i stayed up for this  ,1,103,19
i feel like the space they had was too small for them haha  great job though ,1,77,16
very good ,1,10,2
remember  this will likely be up on the late show youtube channel after  go there and stream it and share it so we can get it to the trending page   ,1,149,31
wow that was one of their best live performances,1,48,9
i wish square up really existed on vinyl  ,1,42,9
am i the only one who had chills the whole time  very surreal moment  so happy for the girls they smashed it,1,108,22
cool  now it s just the waiting part for everything lol,1,55,10
fuck yeah,1,9,2
they did so good    ,1,20,4
they absolutely killed it,1,25,4
ya haha gonna have to go from ottawa,1,36,8
holy shit they are killing jt     ,1,34,6
i m from ottawa and have no one to go with  please inbox me if you re interested or know anyone who might be in travelling to hamilton  ,1,136,26
just perform,1,12,2
are they going to interview or just perform ,1,44,8
 gestures broadly at the state of our politics ,1,47,8
dont worry about looking like a  typical kpop fan   my husband is a really tall  long hair  gauged ears  tattooed guy in a death metal band  i got him into blackpink  and he s planning to attend the show with me  he definitely doesnt look like a kpop fan and he doesnt care  you shouldnt either and go and have fun     ,1,319,61
nope  me and one of my friends from dfw hahaha,1,46,10
it may be that i am very tired  but this feels very surreal ,1,60,13
perfect lmao  we stan l8 nite ,1,30,6
lol that s so funny  i m happy for you  is she tagging along anyway or you just going solo  maybe i ll try and find the courage to ask lol,1,138,28
omg it s almost happening guys,1,30,5
what i need now is for all 8 of the current daily late night type show hosts  fallon  kimmel  colbert  corden  meyers  o brien  noah and daly  to form a boy group  call them l8 nite ,1,182,35
how much do y all think tickets will be  i really want to gear up for hit my wallet will take    ,1,97,21
anyone from ottawa planning to go to hamilton  i have no one to go with    ,1,75,16
no wonder  i was on ticketmaster like 5 minutes of the announcement and couldn t find any time slots for the forum,1,114,21
so i m going to red velvet on friday  sunmi in march  and now hopefully this in april  this is getting far too expensive ,1,121,23
this was so me in the beginning when i got into blackpink and when i watched all the music videos i was confused on who is who  i literally thought jisoo and ros  were twins  because of how much they visually looked alike ,1,222,43
you and i are almost in the exact boat  it s surreal hahaha  but i talked it out with her and i m going  i d say give it a shot ,1,128,28
hahahah john and stephen talking about being in the k pop band  xd ,1,67,12
its listed on the website for the venue,1,39,8
honestly  if i can t land tickets at face value  pretty sure im going to just end up paying resale anyway,1,105,20
i only recently got into bp  and my wife wasn t very interested in it when i tried to show her the songs  she s not the jealous type  i just don t think she d understand why i m a fan  and might think it s something more than just me enjoying the music and performance  i ll probably always just rely on this subreddit and youtube lol,1,334,62
i m going to both red velvet and sunmi by myself  and more than likely bp  and you would never think that i was a kpop fan just by looking at me  i m a little wary  but there is no way i am going to miss some of my favorite artists  just be happy and in the moment seeing them ,1,277,59
graduating this semester  atlanta concert is a couple days before  d,1,68,11
how do you know  ,1,17,5
what kind of shit is that  not a real blink if you have shit you need to do alright,1,83,19
what are speculation for ticket prices  ,1,40,6
got my ticket today  so glad i made the trek up to nyc even though i was still on the waitlist  i m so freakin excited  ,1,120,26
we got an atlanta date    willing to spend sooo much money on these,1,67,13
and even then  it s usually jokes  not like it s cnn ,1,53,10
atlanta prices are  80  270,1,27,4
hopefully once the chase center is finished they can come to sf next year  but amazing nonetheless and they re in my area  either way flight  hotel  and tickets would be suicide on the wallet  lol,1,196,35
sorry to hear  not to rub in your face or anything but my days off from work is thursday friday  i m so freaking hyped     taking that weds off hopefully if i get a ticket  ,1,173,34
any idea of ticket prices  specifically in the 107 and 123 section near the stage ,1,82,15
just got this email from powerhouse    anyone else got it too  [ ,1,65,12
that s the premise of the show    it s a political talk show ,1,61,11
wow    they just said that 55 years ago tonight the beatles played their first usa show at this same venue   ,1,109,21
well it seems feb 20 at 4 pm pst time ,1,38,10
maybe they release it a day or few before feb 20 is when most of the na tickets go on sale  also  vip pricing too it seems ,1,123,27
of course they re not gonna be 1st up   made popcorn and everything       ,1,74,13
prob towards the end if not at the very end  ,1,45,10
never thought i d see the day to see john oliver  amp  bp on the same show  what a time to be alive  ,1,101,22
does anyone know what time the musical guests usually go on  too much politics  ,1,80,14
do all shows have to be this political  ugh  this is why i don t watch tv anymore   ,1,84,17
thanks for that rant and that fake concern  i can count the ppl one 1 hand that cares  also a smaller arena would have nicer seats and thus charge even more  ,1,158,31
[\ blackpinkonlssc is now trending worldwide]  ,1,47,5
why can t you go    ,1,20,5
 atlanta blinks make some noise    ,1,35,5
    ily ,1,8,2
aww  i would cross the pacific ocean for her,1,44,9
where does it show when the tickets go on sale  sorry  having trouble finding ,1,78,14
waiting for a teply too,1,23,5
i m planning on doing la  ,1,26,5
right after finals  atlanta here i comeeeee,1,43,7
can we have ruby jane with a new hair colour,1,44,10
thanks for the link ,1,20,4
fucking same  i was half expecting a show in sf hell even washington but la it is  gotta make that long ass drive,1,113,23
toronto   ,1,10,2
can t gatekeep me  i ll be all up in your area  at least as long as that area is not newark on a wednesday night ,1,113,24
that s a big mood right there  debating whether i should go due to that situation haha ,1,87,16
dude here  also possibly going alone  let s definitely link up if we re all   going    solo   no pun intended    sike  ,1,119,19
if you are making excuses to not go  then you aren t a blink  that s more tickets for the real blinks who want to go  ,1,118,24
let korea and japan have twice   where bp is going no other kpop gg have been to before  they ll be so insanely popular that interscope would want to take over from yg from now on  ,1,181,35
hell yeah brother  the only thing is finding seats together  ,1,61,11
i need blackpink to meet my ult bias of ten years john oliver  also what a sentence that is ,1,92,19
damn  la for me  ,1,17,4
they look great ,1,16,3
thank you  will update  ,1,24,4
any la people here want to form a group ,1,40,9
but it is true  i love the girls but lets be objective  they re not the strongest live performers and their music isn t the only reason we re fans  we know they re funny  sweet and caring girls  but the general public doesn t care about that and i m worried for them  if you go over to  and look up any thread about blackpink  there s so much hating going on its ridiculous    some people are calling them a waste of resources  they called their sure thing cover a bad karaoke  etc  i do believe they re hyped a bit too much now  it doesn t correspond with their talent  they re good  but not a top kpop group in terms of live performances and i really don t want them to receive anymore hate ,1,693,126
i would be very surprised if the concert has actual cheap tickets available ,1,76,13
based on their ig updates  there should be only a performance ,1,62,11
forreal man its bp its legendary,1,32,6
if i do end up getting tickets we should all link,1,49,11
i so wish i could go    but these cities are nowhere near me  and even if i did have the extra funds to travel  i can t pull it off on a wednesday  next time  blackpink  lt 3 they ll be back      ,1,196,41
smaller venue would make the tickets even more expensive,1,56,9
ay i m also a dude looking for some pals to roll up with,1,56,13
good luck       ,1,16,3
such a big arena  i ll be surprised if it completely sells out  the close up and vip tickets will sell out instantly  though ,1,125,23
i won t sweetie  ,1,17,4
i m in the there      if i get to tickets ,1,42,10
more tickets for the rest of us   ,1,34,8
i want curly hair jisoo back  ,1,30,6
bro i m in the same boat as you  i might as my sister if she wants to come but i ll go alone if i have to ,1,106,26
so happy for them and all of us blinks ,1,39,9
check twitter  i saw people sharing streaming links earlier  ,1,61,9
they re looking at differen t cameras it looks like lol ,1,56,9
good luck getting tickets  atlanta is about 3 hrs from me and i wish i could go but i wasn t expecting this so i doubt i d get to this time  i can only hope the tour does so well they come back next year ,1,204,44
i know  but essentially bp is still a k pop group    you know they have many haters in asia  especially south korea and japan lol i wish they can be successful everywhere around the world,1,187,34
you re right thanks    i hope i get tickets ,1,44,9
i agree this is all so surreal  i wasn t expecting this at all  i ve been watching stephen since his daily show days and i remember his  feud  with rain  i m so glad the girls had fun and it s almost time to watch them ,1,219,43
looks like i m moving my vacation at work a month later  ,1,57,11
south korean music market is too small if you want to grow  it s better business decision expand to other bigger markets ,1,121,21
looks like they go on sale on the 20th,1,38,9
what city are you thinking about going to  same here  we should roll through together  ,1,87,15
bless this venue for ticket pricing info  hopefully it s the same for the other venues ,1,87,15
looks like axs  not ticketmaster  on sale 20 feb  [rosemont]   ,1,63,11
skip dude,1,9,2
i wanna know too,1,16,4
anyone know where i can stream this  ,1,37,7
you da real mvp,1,15,4
on such a highly packed concert schedule  i am now having a strong sense that yg are going to abandon bp in the south korean domestic market     they are now so overworked  the 2019 schedule is in a stark contrast with the 2016 2018 one    ,1,240,43
yes it s excellent  all the big stars perform here  ,1,52,9
red velvet is in the same nj venue  and it sold out instantly  so don t let your guard down  be on standby and buy it as soon as it s on sale  otherwise the scalpers will post it at 3x the price  ,1,196,41
20 feb  axs  not ticketmaster  [inglewood]   ,1,45,7
anyone know when the los angeles show tickets go on sale  cant seem to find the show page on ticketmaster  ,1,107,20
poor lisa  ,1,11,3
fuck blackpink are in hamilton when i go to japan  ,1,51,10
do it    forget about what a  typical  fan looks like  anyone can love music   i ve never been to a k pop concert period  but last year i went to a concert alone for lea michele  amp  darren criss  i was a bit nervous too but you know what  i had the time of my life  it was a ball  such a beautiful show  and i would be so sad if i had missed it just because my husband didn t really want to go with me   he was willing  but wasn t super interested in the music  and honestly  i got a way better view by spending the money on a better seat instead of two far back seats for someone who didn t really want to be there   imho  once the show starts  you re not talking to anyone anyway and no one is paying attention to you  they re watching the show  so it won t matter you re alone or who you are  just go  amp  have fun     lt 3,1,829,164
lisa looks almost unprepared for this shot  but jisoo isn t even looking at the camera lol,1,90,16
i m so pissed that this is on a wednesday   it s so strange that this isn t even listed on the prudential center website yet  hopefully ticket info is released soon ,1,165,30
this show is a big nope for me  ticket is going to cost a lot of money  but blackpink doesn t really have a lot of songs  i like them  but that show can t be very long  doesn t seem worth it compare to red velvet  this weekend   who have a ton of material  8pm on a wednesday in newark  i would have to leave work and rush to newark on the train  then i would have to go all the way back to nyc late at night  way too inconvenient  would be more doable on a weekend  big arena show  tickets that are close will cost a fortune  affordable tickets will be so far away as to not even be worth going  smaller venue would be better  winner played at the hulu theater at msg  why couldn t they go there  hope anyone who goes has fun  but i m gonna sit this one out ,1,759,152
can anyone recommend any good hotels or places to stay near newark  i ve never been to new jersey before  i m gonna have to travel from boston ,1,143,26
is the venue good  my friend is loathing newark  i m tempted to make the trip down to atlanta on my way to fl  ,1,111,23
it s for the purposes of the show  late night shows air at night  but they are recorded earlier in the day  it s more convenient for the crew  the guests and a studio audience to record it during the daytime but show it on tv at night  so  when they performed it  it was live for the audience and the camera  but now when we see it on tv  it s the recording of the earlier live performance ,1,390,75
from my end  i only see hamilton s ticket sale date showing  los angeles is not even on the ticketmaster yet  perhaps we have to wait a little bit longer  ,1,155,29
wait what  they are gonna be in atl ,1,36,8
atlanta im freaking iut sjdjejej,1,32,5
hahaha that s a cute caption    i love him  such a funny  smart guy ,1,68,14
right during finals week  gt \_ lt   amp  x200b  blackpink gt college degree  amp  x200b  see y all in hamilton,1,111,13
tickets when ,1,13,2
i would have to go about 10 miles  ,1,35,8
eu they had 4 ticket max i think ,1,33,8
pretty much its if you own a car you go  i was really excited because i was almost certain it was going to be in toronto  and hoping prices weren t too high,1,156,32

well because i m so young  everyone assumes that i just like to look at good looking korean guys  when obviously it s so much more than that  most people here found them when they were going through rough times but  again  because i haven t really been alive for as long  i ve never truly  struggled   however  i feel that i ve really grown as a person because of them  they inspire me to work harder and have shown me that hard work really does pay off  i ve become much more open minded and understanding of other people  they re kind  humble  genuine  talented  hardworking  and they re honestly my role models  when i say i want to be like them  i definitely don t want to be an idol  but i want to be able to inspire others and to positively impact everyone around me the way they do  i look up to them  the same way young athletes would look up to another athlete  and i feel like nobody takes me seriously when i try to explain  people act like i would be the type of fan to get angry if they ever dated  but i would support whatever relationship they got into  part of it is the whole  12 year old fans  kind of mindset  even older armys look down on the younger fans because they think we re insensitive but we all like bangtan for the same reasons  and to put it simply  they make us happy  but i never actually say this out loud and just reply with   i enjoy their music    ,0,1385,258

i ve never seen a seating chart with prices    let us know if you find it  short answer  about  220 to  300 depending on section  night  and probably city  long answer  below  also  btw  i m selling my extra tickets for metlife sunday 5 19  sec 117 row 19  amp  sec 139 row 26  face value   221  amp   262  dm me  anyone  if interested   i have been puzzled by  face value  for tickets as well  i have tickets for both nights in nj  amp  pricing seems to be different for each night  i have sec 139 ticket that cost  303 for saturday  amp  same section  lower row   for  262 on sunday  tm also seems to have their own rubric for what s desirable  which doesn t mesh with my thinking  and charges more  i prefer to be close to the extended stage  so i can see both stages head on  tm seems to value sections closer to the main stage  where i feel you re looking at the boys  backs a lot when they are on extended stage   so my tickets near the extended stage  sec 116 117  cost  221 but section 139  btw the two stages  is higher  my floor ticket  just got yesterday  so excited   from tm was  262  so hopefully that gives you some idea  i think probably each venue  amp  each night are different  the  303 is the highest i ve seen  i think  for face value   amp  x200b ,0,1269,232

that was a really well constructed survey  are you showing off a bit   am teasing you in the nice way      one note  there s a question about what we do as individuals followed immediately by a question about the larger implications of what we do as individuals     which might invite a very few people to put  and even judge  their actions in context and a different light  people tend to give answers that make themselves look good  even in anonymous surveys  so a very few people might go back to revisit some of their earlier answers  it s a small thing but  if you consider and discuss it in your paper     the self aware student usually gets the better grade  many other notes  very well worded questions     short  simple  easy to read     easy to understand     easy to answer     but still substantial and open ended questions  very hard to do this right so     nice work  also     good layout  and an excellent length too     not exhausting but still thorough and complete and satisfying for the survey taker  most importantly  i think you gave it to the right people     anyway  lots of room for a good grade with much that will be learned  thank you for posting this  like everyone else here  i really enjoyed doing it and am eager to know what you find out    ,0,1273,232

people develop expectations very quickly after watching the cb trailer  because their albums tend to be diverse  i doubt we ll get a full album that is entirely hip hop focused  based on their previous ones  i think they ll stick with a pop influence and the usual rap   ballad tracks  bts tends to stick with a common theme throughout their albums  not a genre ,0,362,63
tbh when i first watched the trailer  i thought  oh now we re going hiphop   i kinda solidified that idea already in my head  but when the concept photos dropped i    don t know anymore  i personally like their genre hopping  my taste ranges from loud songs  fire  not today  to chill ones  rain  i like it   so far i am really satisfied as a fan and even if this album will not stick to hiphop  a genre i don t kinda like that much   it s fine for me  i can t say the same for those planning to  re stan  after they heard persona because they are really expecting that bts will be returning to their old sound this time around  and to be more honest it s the title track i m nervous about  this time i m hoping it s hiphop and sounds nothing like idol or dna  bts rapline is very strong so i m expecting they ll let them shine in the title track this time around  and i personally think they re not sacrificing their quality or sound ever since they blew up  man  dna fake love and idol  especially  were never gp friendly songs  they just do what they want to do  just hope they won t sacrifice their songs  quality for the sake of the narrative they re pushing though ,0,1171,211
namjoon   athena because she was the goddess of wisdom and was a capable leader she was also associated with strategic warfare military strategy  and i assume was quite logical and able to withstand hardships as she was called  promachos     she who fights in front   and i tie that into how namjoon represent the group very well and takes all attacks for the team she was also said to be very keen and sharp of eye as well as skillful  athena was praised for her compassion and generosity   embodied wisdom and rational thought  athena could be a fierce and ruthless warrior too  rm the fierce rapper  she was also the goddess of inspiration  civilization  as well as law and justice  namjoon is very creative and has a lot of inspirations and he is in my opinion very aware of civilization s nature and of what is right and wrong always striving to be a better persona and learn from his mistakes  athena has become an international symbol of wisdom  the arts  and classical learning and namjoon is very intelligent wise well educated and artistic maybe demeter too with his love for nature and for being the goddess of growth organic in her case and spiritual and personal in namjoon s   amp  x200b  jimin   aphrodite because she was the goddess of beauty  love and desire sexuality  jimin is very beautiful and elegant graceful   very caring and loving with people and can be very shameless and sexy at times  oozing sex appeal aphrodite was also rumoured to be quite tempestuous and we know jimin has a temper and can be very scary when angered aphrodite was also described to have a very sweet and pleasing voice like honey and jimin has such a sweet singing voice but can be quite soft spoken too aphrodite was also said to have had many lovers and jmin can be pretty flirty and tactile with anyone aphrodite was also the goddess of passion and we know how passionate and hard working jimin is  in laconia  aphrodite was worshipped as a warrior goddess and jimin used to do both taekwondo and kendo one of aphrodite s most common literary epithets is philommeid s which means  smile loving  as she was often depicted as not with a smile on her face but also loving seeing others smile jimin has a lovely smile and he loves people smiling she was also said to be very seductive and to hold grudges we have also seen how sensual jimin can be and know of his little accidents and the others have said that he can hold grudges   amp  x200b  hoseok   hestia because she was the goddess of the hearth   home   domesticity and family  i think hobi is one of the members that keeps the band together and united taking care of them and understanding their needs he is the energy of the group like how the heart provides energy to the home he also has a great bond with his family and he has mentioned that they keep him going he can be really domestic with the members and is a very warm person hestia is described as a kind  forgiving and discreet goddess with a passive non confrontational nature  and i think hat applies to hobi too on the other hand  hestia was also very much protective and could get quite fierce like hobi  generally she was not given much characterization and description in mythology so i also tie that into how the members have said hobi is very adaptable and how mysterious he can seem like a closed book but that he is the energy and warmth of the team hestia was essentially the flame the energy source and while she was mild mannered she was immensely respected and treated well even admired that respect might have been because the flame can be volatile too and angering it can only cause damage  i think that counts for hobi as well   amp  x200b  taehyung   a combination of apollo and dionysus   first of all   apollo was the god of music   poetry and art and taehyung has been showing and increasing level of interest in both music and art and has started delving deeper into both he was also the god of healing light and the sun and we all know how sunny and warm taehyung can be and how healing his presence can be as stated by jimin because of his purity  as the protector of young  apollo was concerned with the health of children and we know taehyung s affinity with children and he was also the protector of herds and flocks and taehyung has an affinity with animals as well as for dionysus he was the god of theater and we know how theatrical taehyung can be with his amazing expressions and acting he was also the god of ritual madness and ecstasy and was often called eleutherios  meaning  the liberator   because his wine  music  and ecstatic dance freed his followers from self conscious fear and care  and subvert the oppressive restraints   in that way he represented freedom and we all know how free spirited taehyung can be and how sometimes he could be the opposite of self conscious he was also described as possessing an androgynous beauty and i feel that for taehyung as well   amp  x200b  yoongi   a combination of hyphaestus and hades  first   hyphaestus was the god of carpenters   craftsmen and artisans  yoongi has said multiple times how interested he has always been in making things   taking them apart and building them and how interested he is in furniture and electronics hephaestus was also the patron god of the arts and we know how much yoongi loves music hephaestus was the god of fire too yoongi s rap is fire nothing more to say passionate and burning hephaestus like yoongi was also crafty and quite smart and although he seemed fierce and angry   he was a kind and peace loving god   like yoongi as for hades   he was the god of night and dreams and we know how much yoongi loves both sleeping and staying up at night hades was also the god of wealth and riches and we know how yoongi often said his greed was a shackle and how wealthy he is now compared to how he grew up  hades was depicted as stern and unyielding  unmoved by things and that was how yoongi was initially seen like hades might have also loved music as he was so moved by orpheus song that he allowed him to take eurydike back to the land of the living   amp  x200b  seokjin   a combination of eros and the roman god janus first of all   eros was the god of love and was depicted as extremely handsome jin is very very handsome and very caring and loving eros was also depicted as mischievous and meddling in the affairs of gods and mortals caused bonds of love to form and drama to unfold  jin can be very mischievious and playful and can cause a lot of drama but he is also very supportive as for janus  he was the roman god of beginnings  gates  transitions  time  duality  doorways  passages  and ending   i tie that to the fact that jin started from the beginning with no experience whatsoever bu taking advantage of a passage a doorway an opportunity that was given to him through very hard work and time he transitioned to the level he is now and there is no ending to his improvement as of yet  janus symbolized change and transitions such as the progress of past to future  from one condition to another  from one vision to another  and young people s growth to adulthood but also all the states in between those i tie that into jin progressing so so much and still possessing a vision for even more progress i also consider jun to be quite mature but to also be carefree and playful   so like janus represented the middle ground between youth and adulthood  jin does too janus was also depicted as having two faces and representing duality and i also think that jin also has a dual nature   amp  x200b  jungkook   hermes  because he is the god of sports and athletes and we all know how athletic jungkook is and how much he loves all kinds of sports  in the  iliad   hermes was called  the bringer of good luck    guide and guardian   and  excellent in all the tricks  we all know how lucky jungkook is and can be and how excellent he is at everything and i tied the guide adjective as him leading the choreos and being center quite often hermes was also described as quite the trickster as well   mostly for his own satisfaction or to benefit others and i think jungkook fits that as well he can be quite the trickster at times   often loving teasing the other members for his satisfaction or for their benefit to cheer them up he can also be quite funny and crafty to make both them or us laugh  hermes was also described as having a mastery of persuasion and special pleading   i tie that to jungkook having bambi eyes and the members not being able to say no to him armys too  hermes is also the patron and protector of travelers  herdsmen  thieves  orators and wit  literature and poets  athletics and sports  invention and trade as such his interests were considered to be varied and widespread just like jungkook jungkook is interested and wants to try so many things   amp  x200b ,0,8836,1531

i m going to the bangkok concert on saturday  it will be my 17th time seeing them live since i started this life style change in 2017  living in korea has made me very lucky in this regard  i ve also traveled to macao  taiwan  and singapore to see them  i m going to gwangju to see them  i m nervous about muster lottery but i remind myself  despite that outcome  i m very fortunate in my army life  i had a rough week at work because of insecure  toxic co workers i thought were friends who hurt me  i ve caused no harm to anyone  i was minding my own business and happily living my own life  and for some reason that was scary and threatening to them  luckily i m too wise to get caught up and dragged down with them so i m just distancing myself from the negativity but this week     i am  so deeply grateful  i have the boys to make me smile  to follow to new countries experiences  and to support for comeback  some people never gave themselves permission to just be happy in life  so instead of seeing all the reasons to be happy and enjoy life  they create problems from those dark whispers in their minds  i feel bad for them  i hope they can learn to overcome that part of themselves  and see that happiness is always there  until then  i m just going to continue doing my thing  loving myself  and seeing the abundance of happiness around me  ,0,1353,246

i do like using the sports analogy to explain how why i watch people play video games on twitch youtube  live tournaments  etc  however  not everyone who i try to explain bts to  is into sports  so i end up having to use other analogies for things that they are passionate about  which can be difficult  bts is my favorite  marvel superhero team   comic book series  the avengers    plus they look good and send positive and empathetic vibes with the power of their music ,0,472,83

well i watched meteor garden because netflix kept recommending it  and despite the fluffy  dramatic story it was a fun watch and i googled the show on why its so hot on netflix  found out that its made from a famous manga which has been made several times before and its korean version  boys over flowers  kept cropping up in all the articles  so i watched some scenes of boys over flowers on netflix to see what the hype is about and got the second lead syndrome  the second lead in it has a much bigger sadder and self sacrificial role   so then i looked up that actor and turned out he was part of a very famous 2nd gen kpop group  so i watched a couple of videos of his singles and group and i was like woah kpop was doing such amazing videos in 2005    also i love videos with great choreo  etc  as i am used to that in bollywood  love dancing myself and was sick of hollywood videos  i didn t look any further though because i knew it could get addicting and i don t have time but youtube knows how to pull you in  one day  it automatically played bts charlie puth collab and their rainism cover and then i had to check out bts  rest is history  haha,0,1156,221

i think it really depends on what people mean with  bts are returning to their roots  or whatever  when does that begin  or end  because hyyh is somewhat  old  but sounds nothing like 2 cool 4 skool and has more of a soft sound to some songs  at the end of the day  none of their albums have been entirely one genre if you listen to all the tracks  so i think it d be foolish to assume they d do that now ,0,405,81

well  i won t expecting this album follow heavily hip hop though it is their main genre though the intro is rm  he is the rapper   so of course he s rap  the different is how he rap compared with before   they always diverse in their music never sticking on one genre alone  so this time probably the same  and no  i m not going to be disappointed  well they are 7 people  of course they want to try new genre  each of their album has different vibe following their concept and never the same  come one this kind of discussion happen everytime time they release an album  though it is alright to have an expectation because everyone has their own preference  will they able satisfy everyone  definitely not  but this is their beauty right  so i m just curious about what kind of sound they are going to offer this time because in my opinion they always improve musically ,0,871,156
i wish i could find the video that really did it for me but i can t seem to find it now    anyway  pressing on trigger points is one aspect of releasing muscles  however  there s another aspect where you provide resistance to your facial muscles  almost like they re having to  lift weights   the weights in this instance is your fingers  like i can take lay my hand palm toward my face  with the index finger lining up right along my brow bone  i lift my brow  the skin and muscles  up towards my hairline  while lifting  use your brow muscles and try to furrow your brow like you re squinting  it may hurt a bit but it shouldn t be too bad  more like hitting a pressure point which is a good hurt  keep pressing and furrowing for 30 seconds to a minute  30 secs are good for your first few times  and release  the eyebrow you just released will now look higher than your unreleased eyebrow  well  at least mine does  i do this type of resistance training with all my facial muscles and it really does make a difference especially if you re consistant ,0,1053,192

i agree  it s normal for huge acts to have a few spare tickets  and it s a pretty small number compared to capacity  and getting tickets the day they go on sale is a bloody nightmare  not least because the servers just can t handle us   i got my tickets for bkk day 2 only because the website crashed and scared off most armys for a while  otherwise i d never have had a shot ,0,376,72

i d be as disappointed as i ve been since yf i suppose    i think i rode the pop wave of bangtan okay i guess  after 2016 i came to grips with it  but last year  with tear and ddaeng and now this year with persona  i think they re pivoting back toward their earlier sound  i guess we won t know until the album drops but i don t foresee this album being full of pop music  just bc of all the hints they d dropped  bringing back orul82 at the gayos last year and then the whole armypedia thing i think is their way of gearing fans back that way  reminding them of old songs from bangtan and older sounds that they re about to bring back so new pop based fans won t be shocked by the change  but that s just my take on it  i was right about persona being a joon intro based on these clues so i m feeling about 80  confident that the album is probably going to be a hiphop heavy mix  kind of like hyyh pt 1 or 2 was  they re never going to go full dark  amp  wild on us again until rapline drops an official subunit though  i also wonder if we may get a cypher on this album but i know that s probably the most farfetched lol,0,1122,219

the answer is simple for me  bts make me happy  that s all that matters and that s all my family needs to know  they ve rolled their eyes and scoffed every time i mention bts but it s all just teasing  when i told them i was going to la for the rose concert  they didn t say anything negative  i m an adult  i live by myself  i pay my own way  i m not pestering anyone with my adoration and admiration of bts  i m just happy  everyone around me has remarked about how positive and happy and  glowing  i am lately  and bts is the reason  ,0,537,102

i think most fans who know to expect the unexpected with bts won t be upset disappointed as long as the music is good  i m one of those hoping for more hip hop but i m also expecting it won t be a full hip hop album  my first comeback was tear and i had no predictions for what that album would be like and man  was i pleasantly surprised ,0,339,66

honestly i don t see the point having the teaser different to the song lol  half the time i actually prefer the sound of the teaser over the actual release  aka idol   i felt so cheated back then haha  i just wish they d release a full studio version of the teaser version somewhere   ,0,285,53
am i the only one who realized that they increased the number of seats in each location  but reduced the number of locations  i know that a lot of it is just plain logistics  but it makes me a little sad because there are so many armys who can t go either because they aren t close by or because of financial pressures  i personally can t fly down to la in the middle of finals week  whereas the oakland show i went to was close by  but i ended up paying more than 2x of what bighit was selling ,0,495,97
i agree with you but i think your first sentence only applies to ot7 albums  the mixtapes are really consistent and while by itself there isn t anything wrong with genre concept hopping throughout an album  i think that the cohesiveness of all of the mixtapes is a big factor as to why they re enjoyable listens from start to finish   gt  so i think fans have to take all of the thought that s taken into consideration when you re an idol group and adjust expectations accordingly  this is also very true  after the comeback trailer dropped i let myself run wild with ideas for persona before i realised that an idol group probably wouldn t do half of those things  especially one with such a diverse fandom in terms of music taste and feelings  there are things bts does  musically or otherwise  that i actually don t care for but i put up with it because they are a kpop group and it s popular within the industry  and besides it doesn t matter too much if i m generally happy with the music  if it helps though so what wasn t exactly joon s favourite track from tear either if i m remembering the vlive correctly lmao  ,0,1122,197

sometimes  not in depth explanations are better  why not mention that both their music and the group itself make you happy  if they really want to know more  they might ask what precisely makes you happy  and you can ellaborate  if they don t and just start judging you and the way you get some of your happiness  don t waste your breath trying to explain   unless that s really important to you that they understand you   maybe they ll be more open to a conversation later  or maybe they never will get that the source of joy and happiness is different for everyone    as long as you re not wasting away your life because of your love for bangtan  i don t see what s wrong with it ,0,682,122

it s not that i don t talk about them or even that i haven t told them some of the reasons  but they hear what they want to hear and see what they want to see  my dad  who has always been ridiculously supportive of my interests  even did it  he s the type who if i told him i was into pens  he d start asking me about pen tip sizes and the merits of my favorite ink  so imagine my surprise when i m telling him about them and he bulldozes right over it and goes into a spiel about manufactured boy bands  unable to hear anything i said  then he suddenly segued into how he s into german rap now  ,0,596,118
this is exactly what i experienced in the loveyourself comebacks so now i m just training my brain to not have any expectations  i don t want to get carried away in the foretelling as it underwhelms my acceptance to what the actual result is  i refused to have expectations with ly tear and that album blew me away    honestly   yes a thousand times yes   i would love for something more hip hop and r amp b sounding coming from bts only cuz that s what i m into now  but i have no idea what the music trends are nowadays  maybe my tastes are outdated compared to the direction and preference of the creative team involved with bts  music  plus  with their styling for persona  it looks pretty and soft  again   i wish they would be more daring edgy with their haircuts but i don t know why it s always the perennial coconut with demure  accidental to 10  reveal  forehead  i can t anymore  i ll just be that bish who is done with their hair    hope some save their downvotes     our individuality allows us to have differing preferences    i m just not hoping for anything and will just wait and see  p s   i ll be the first to lose my wig and bust a left tit if dat shit be fo real tho  ,0,1189,218

i think that s just the consumerist side of buying albums in general  say 75  of songs are ones that you really love listening to non stop  but the 25  are your hard passes doesn t fit your taste in music  even ly  her  which is overall a good  cohesive album thematically  stops me from listening to it all the way because i always skip best of me  i just don t like it enough to listen all the way it i have the option to skip  that mentality is the reason why streaming services have now become the dominant way to listen to music  it s all about the ability to personalize  there s no question that bts has never made a song half assedly  but i agree that a return to their hip hop r amp b roots one day is one hell of a treat  and now that they have the western markets tapping in on their every move  the genres more familiar to them  like rock and hip hop  would better coincide with their tastes in music ,0,913,169

hmm    not really  because they end up incorporating the teaser in an award show performance or a studio version in a repackage  like young forever   sometimes their teasers are just the bridge  either the instrumental or the vocal  like dna s second teaser  bst  fake love or even idol  even though the instrumental was different   either way  i get hyped to listen to new music lol  ,0,385,64
i think it really builds a lot of suspense just giving us little pieces  and then the payoff hearing how it all fits together  i think the only time i was ever disappointed was idol not having traditional instruments  but then we got finally got the payoff with the mma perf  which i pray every day they ll release that version on soundcloud for festa or something   but aside from idol and blood sweat  amp  tears  their teasers pretty strictly use musical phrases that are identical to how they are in the final version  they just have certain parts  or all  of the instrumental stripped back  i wouldn t really consider that misleading  and i don t even really qualify it as being stylistically different  but it is difficult to anticipate how the final version will sound  personally  i really love hearing the little snippets of bare vocals like we got in the fake love and spring day teasers  they kind of do the same thing with the visuals too  where the cuts that they use aren t necessarily the same ones that are in the final mv  or in the case of the fake love first teaser  basically a prequel stand alone mini short film   which i just think is kind of fun  and since the teasers are only released like  a few days before the actual mv album  and i don t think many people base their preorder decisions solely on how the teaser sounds  i don t find it a problem in that regard  tl dr  perfectly fine to have a teaser that uses a clip directly from the song  but i don t think it generates the same kind of tense anticipation  can definitely be a double edged sword  but i wouldn t change it  i m in for the wild ride ,0,1630,293

for me the hyyh series  hyyh pt 1 is so pretty with the cherry blossoms  the photo with them laying in the grass in a circle is still one of my all time faveorite group pics  hyyh pt 2 was my first comeback as a fan and they fucked me up so hard  like mint yoongi was a revalation  i still have his and hobi s posters on my wall  i loved the group pic of them all on the cliff too  it s so lovely  i love the overall nature forest theme so much  and young forever is so cool  it s probably my favorite overall  i remember when these dropped there was absolutely zero warning they were planning a comeback so it was a total shock  blonde jin completely fucked the entire fandom lol  like seriously  he was so fucking hot we all died  i especially love the night photos  it s just all so pretty tt  with that said i also love ynwa s bus stop pics  that s some of my favorite overall styling  as well as tear y and answer e  the o photos are so cool  like fairies  i clearly have a taste for simplistic and nature themed shots  ,0,1025,198
i ve had to come to accept that whatever genre i want from bts will never be consistently followed through  they don t exactly have entire artistic freedom because their performances have to be taken into consideration  as well as for delivering to a wide spectrum audience  namjoon kind of mentioned this when talking about the track so what  one that i detest   it s truly on the album because it s geared towards the live atmosphere it would create for their coming tour  so i think fans have to take all of the thought that s taken into consideration when you re an idol group and adjust expectations accordingly  ,0,618,103

i don t think there s really going to be an issue for the stadiums  the amount isn t really obvious in a stadium  and the wings tour was  sold out   but when ticketmaster released a bunch of tickets the night before  i noticed the front seated area was almost completely empty and it was still a great concert lol   i think the main issue in the us is that most people don t live that close to the venue  just as an example  for chicago  obviously there are a lot of people who go from chicago  but there are a good portion of people who go there that aren t from that area as well  for people who aren t from that area  they have to deal with hotels  planes  etc  and most people who pay  that  much to get there want good seats  i e  floor soundcheck close 100 levels   additionally  only people who live near chicago can really suddenly plan their trip to chicago when sites like ticketmaster release a bunch of good seats the day before   most people don t like putting such a huge money investment into hotels and planes when they don t even have the guarantee of getting a ticket  regardless  most army who are in the loop with army stuff generally wait until pretty close to the concert date to buy tickets because after all the times we ve been dragged for a loop most of us have learned haha ,0,1301,236

i really like the lyrics of this song  i m a sucker for a theme concept album  and this track definitely fits amongst its brothers and sisters on the hyhh album  another thing i like about this song is that sonically it is very unique  while listening to it  i was trying to place what genre i would categorize the song end  and i had a hard time with that  which in retrospect is a good thing  because it makes the song unique  7 10,0,433,82
you will  never  please people who make expectations on an album sound before the album is released  i m predicting that even if it was an core hiphop album  which they haven t done since 2014  people would still try and find ways to be faux music critic disappointed  tear songs could easily fit into of bts  older discography but you still get people calling the grunge inspired trap beat in fake love  edm   ,0,411,72
 i dont think they will be just hip hop  they will flow with the genres like they used to be  i think most fans are familiar with this  disappointment always have  but you have to criticize for what it is and not for what you expected to be  i m pretty hyped  i can t avoid this feeling but i just want that this album be as good or better than the previous albuns   amp  x200b ,0,378,72

yes i was upset many times  but i m still here  lmao  the two most upsetting instances for me was run and idol  i was mildly annoyed with blood sweat and tears  for run i was upset for 2 5 years  idol  3 months  for blood sweat and tears i was annoyed for 2 hours  i do not know why bighit do this but after so many comebacks i get the vibe that bh likes to keep you guessing  they are the reason for twelvephobia  they hate it when you can predict what they going to do next  well at this point now they already have set habits like comeback timing  tour drops etc  but they like to play games with fans in any way they could  bighit get a kick out of surprising fans  that just my take  ,0,689,137
i m still not recovered from the betrayal that was not including 134340 in answer    i think their albums tend to start more cohesive in themes genres than when they end  thinking about it  wings pops up in my head as an album that starts pretty experimental but somewhat coherent thematically and then after the solos it becomes a lot more different  love yourself her also starts as pure pop and following the theme of her closely and then after the skit changes in tone  same change of thematic cohesiveness could be seen in tear as well  makes sense since they always try to include as much diversity in each album  even if that makes them not follow the themes as closely as they could  i m very curious to see how persona will be structured ,0,747,133
the short answer is no  the answer might be different if this is those fans first bts comeback  but if it s not then you got nothing to worry about  the album genre was never based on the comeback trailer  that song was always done based on the style of the person who sing rap it  serendipity was based on jimins voice and his references  same with tae s singularity and everyone else  i know people like to speculate for fun but to be upset  disappointed  this is the first time i heard that  ,0,495,91

i made a similar post in the concert thread  but i guess i ll chime in  the numbers look as they do for a couple reasons i can think of  the sunday shows are primarily the ones with a lot of tickets still available  most people likely have to take an additional day off  monday  from work whereas for saturday they don t  also  the sunday shows were announced a week later after most fans bought tickets for saturday  it s pretty expensive to attend both shows  if you re aiming for good seats  this is especially true if you re traveling from out of state country because you need to account for an additional days hotel stay  most fans who are local to the venues are likely going to buy secondary tickets closer to the concert date because they ll get it cheaper and since they re nearby they do not need to plan for travel  if you go through the buy sell posts  you ll notice most people are trying to sell sunday tickets and buy saturday tickets  a friday saturday concert works so much better for a lot of people compared to a sunday show   especially when it s still school finals season  lastly  if you were to take the amount of tickets sold for the sunday show and stuffed those people into a venue like prudential in newark  it d be sold out  stadiums host 2 to 3 times the amount of people than a traditional indoor venue  ,0,1335,237

i find that i don t need to explain too much to people who are fans of other things  if they start asking me why i like listening to a bunch of korean kids  i ask them why they speak klingon and the conversation pretty much dies right there  it s the non fans that i have more trouble with  i need to be strategic with them  when i feel that i must talk about bts to non fans  i tend talk about bts as phenomenon rather than bts as cute musicians that i obsess about  for example  i mention the fact that bts is part of a broader korean cultural phenomenon known as the hallyu wave  which is itself part of a fascinating effort on the part of the korean government to promote its culture as an export industry and boost its own tourism industry  i also talk about issues such as    the idol music system in korea and how bts managed to flourish in spite of domination of the market by larger companies  though this is changing     the strong relationship that kpop groups develop with their fans and how bts in particular has fostered this relationship    the immense global reach of the fanbase and how incredibly organized it is    the numerous ways in which bighit is capitalizing on the bts brand  amp  x200b  i don t talk about their music much   my friends and family have different tastes  i also do not talk about how adorable yoongi looks when he s sleeping  how cute jimin looked in bunny ears in the latest run bts  or what namjoon said in his latest vlive or log  i rely on this subreddit to get all emotional about that stuff  ,0,1540,286

i agree that all of this contributed to their pondering disbandment  i just hope that like you say  even if there comes a point where they aren t breaking these records or getting invited on international shows  that they will always have a loyal fanbase as the years go by  even if that means only half of the current army  i hope they never reach a point where they feel unloved  unappreciated  or like has beens ,0,415,74
because they want to give you an element of surprise  the ambiguity gives you anticipation and i like that  it makes me more excited for the actual song and from that more peole would be waiting for the actual mv to drop  i like how unexpected it is so it doesn t bother me that it sounds completely different ,0,310,58
done  all the best ,0,19,4
i m glad their teasers are ambiguous  like film trailers  i would think they are only meant to give you a sense of the genre  tone  hooking visuals  story direction  etc   not the entire plot  which is what playing the hook feels like to me  whether or not others feel  cheated   i don t think so  i mean  can you fall in love with a short teaser so much that you really dislike the outcome of the whole  those motifs can come from anywhere in the song  perhaps they think it gives a different feel than the visuals suggested  the most disappointment i remember of this kind was people s reaction when park jiyeon released  1 min 1 second   i thought it was a bop but the trailer seemed to elevate people s expectations too much and they found the actual song underwhelming ,0,774,139

i have no expectations  and i m looking forward to whatever new music comes out  i also think it s healthy to not let other people s opinions influence your own enjoyment of the music   i know some people were disappointed in dna s sound  and while it s not my favorite  i bop to it to no end whenever i put on love yourself  her  point being that when you re as big as bts  it s good not to think too much about what other people think about your music  i d rather they branch out creatively in whatever suits them  a hip hop heavy album would be interesting  but it s not something i d be heartbroken over if it doesn t happen  perhaps i m biased though  because many of my favorite songs are from hyyh and the love yourself series  which cover a wide range of genres ,0,770,140

okay so  as a musician who writes arrangements often  there are  so many ways to arrange the same song   usually the melody suits tons of different genres  keys  and tempos  next  it seems like bighit works by having multiple producers produce a track and then comparing to see which one is best  instead of everyone making one track together  bighit has many talented producers and they re each biased by their musical preferences  the result is that you ll probably get multiple versions remixes of the same song that sound  awesome   but if you release multiple versions on paid websites  it ll seem like you re indecisive  so what do they do  instead of scrapping everyone else s work  they release one version as the  teaser   if people don t like the teaser  no problem  the title track sounds very different  if they love the teaser  then they re more likely to check out the song  which helps publicity anyway  ,0,919,152

bts likes to genre hop and try out new sounds so i don t expect a 100  hiphop album  love yourself wasn t 100  pop  hiphop  rnb  100  anything  it was a lot of different  creative songs that when played back to back weren t consistently sonically cohesive  but lyrically the theme was present in the entire ly series  to me  the concept of  persona  has the potential for a plethora of different topics  and with those topics come varying sounds and genres played with by bts to best fit what emotions and feelings they re trying to express personally and evoke in listeners  i feel like bts fans will understand whatever direction the boys decide to take  if anything  i would like to think that fans would appreciate the album even more should it experiment with differing sounds  which could be experimenting with hiphop genres  or genre hopping completely   a lot of fans admire bangtan s willingness to defy the conventions of the kpop soundscape in the name of their own passion for music  and from the comeback trailer  it s clear that they don t plan on  selling out  or resorting to making music solely for the mainstream  which i know has been a concern of some in the past   in  persona  rm s lyrics have passion  conviction  honesty  that s one of their selling points that keeps fans dedicated whether bts decides to release an album like ly her or an album like dark and wild  i know this isn t a very cohesive comment and i m kind of all over the place  but to sum it up i would say that the integrity and authenticity of bts  music  so long as it s present in the execution and lyrics  outweighs the importance of the overall genre direction that the boys decide to take with each series album  ,0,1711,293

i trust that no matter what genre s  they put out  the production will be top notch  i m a huge fan of rock hip hop and persona was literally the embodiment of all my favorite music  but if they go with a different direction for the rest of the album  i ll still be happy  the majority of love yourself  tear sounded happy or poppy despite supposedly being a  depressing  album  134340  love maze  magic shop  anpanman  airplane pt  2  so what  the only songs that really matched the audible theme of tear was the intro  outro  title track and the truth untold  even through the tone of the songs were more poppy  the lyrics and meaning spoke for the concept  i have a feeling that map of the soul  persona will be the same way  most of the album being poppy other genres with a few of the tracks being more hiphop based  but all of them will have the  discovering and accepting all facets of yourself  meaning  title track wise  just like with fake love sounding both pop and emo  we ll probably get a song that has definite hip hop vibes but with a pop spin  big hit is really good at providing a genre for everyone no matter their taste  it s why army is so diverse  we have diehard hip hop heads that go bonkers over tracks like outro  tear  ddaeng and the cyphers  we got r amp b and soul fans that salivate over singularity  the truth untold and stigma  and of course the pop crowd that appreciate the hype tracks like dna  so what and interlude  wings i think whatever they come out with will be amazing   ,0,1513,277

i mean  some people will be upset about anything  but i doubt the majority of people would  is there that much expectation for it to be super hip hop heavy  i ve honestly been assuming it will be pretty diverse stylistically  the only thing that would personally be disappointing for me is if it was nearly all ballads since i only like a few ballads  and they take a long time to grow on me  and i have to be in the right mood to listen   but i think we can assume that s not the case given the trailer ,0,504,98

i personally think their albums are always good  the ly series sold the most albums  but i did still see a few people who were disappointed in the overall sonic theme of the series  i also know many people thought  her  wasn t strong  though i believe it is  no matter how high the sales may be  i think some people will still be unhappy  like with ly   but i also think bts always produces quality work  and that their fanbase has only grown during the time of their newer sounds  which means bts clearly doesn t have to rely mostly on hip hop to succeed  whatever people s disappointments may be  i think the music itself will be strong enough  no matter the genre  that most people will be pleased and find multiple songs to enjoy  the value i do see in incorporating more of their older sound is that it will feel like an emotional reward for long time or hardcore fans who are attached to the entirety of the bts discography and who want bts  older style to now receive more public attention and recognition ,0,1013,183
yesterday i actually met up with a dearest friend and confessed to him about liking bangtan  mostly because the restaurant we were in was playing save me   as many  i found bts at a very low point in life  and their music and talent  and the way i can relate to them helped me gain some strength and still helping me move forward in life  i honestly didn t know that i had a good handful of ig friends who like them  but now i do  and it makes me feel closer to them ,0,467,93

i think every single comeback people always develop expectations about the album too hastily after watching the comeback trailer  i remember when singularity dropped a lot of people were like  ohhhh i bet the album is going to be very rnb  chill and genuine  ahhh   the truth is their albums tend to be diverse and they rarely have a common genre of music through all the songs  i personally reallyyyyyy doubt that we will have an album or even just a main track that is completely hip hop based  i think they will remain with their tracks having the mostly pop influence that has been common as of recently  with the usual rap ballad    tracks as b sides  but i would be excited to be wrong lmao  ,0,698,126
i am not expecting this album to be hip hop heavy at all  bts are always changing and with every album we get a new sound  of course  there is always a classic bangtan style song in every album  but i am not to sure why people think this will be a definite return to their roots  the comeback trailers intros have always been a bit different from the tone of the whole album in my opinion  but i am sure despite what route they go  it will be great  organic even   ,0,465,90

i used to have a lot of shame about liking kpop or jpop  but now i just don t really care anymore  i guess that comes with age  27     i have my bts sticker on the back of my car  and my boss and co worker  who is now a casual fan of bts bc of me  know about my love for them  i m not like screaming it from the mountain tops  but i don t mind making it known  if someone asks  i ll tell them  a lot of times  yes it s met with a weird reaction  but if they continue to be weird about it and say that the boys look like  girls  and the same old shit that i ve been hearing for like a decade  i just chalk it up to ignorance  it s 2019 people  i met a girl at a kpop concert for another group who  in her very bitter head space  told me that if she were me  she would be embarrassed to have anything public  like a bumper sticker  that showed she liked bts because she would not want to be associated with army  i can admit a select few in this fandom are a lil off their rocker  but jesus christ  seriously  since then i have made a point to be even more shameless  partly out of spite bc i m petty  but also because i m proud to like bts  they have some so far since i ve become a fan so like the true mama bear i am  i ll take about my boys any chance i get  when prompted anyway      ,0,1287,263

may be they ll reach beyonce status where they can make music together while they are in their 40s and still be no  1  i remember them talking that they rose so fast they were worried they would lose everything so fast  they even considered disbanding last year before their contract renewal   i think it might have been in part because the pressure to be perfect break records be 1st probably is a heavy burden to bear  sometimes people say its also good to retire when you are at the top then to get pushed out to retirement  i wish i could see into the future for them  but right now i just want them to enjoy the ride and trust that as long as they keep making music they will have fans who love and listen to their music  ,0,727,138

they are talented and work hard for what they want and most importantly they believed in themselves and their vision when no one else did  they share their struggles with us which makes us connect with them because after all  they are human and they have flaws and they have made mistakes but so has everyone else  they aren t perfect and it s good knowing that  their music has really impacted me as a person  i discovered them when i was going through a really tough time and no artists was doing what they are doing now  it goes beyond their looks  their music transcends language and their story truly inspires  ,0,616,110

i m not sure why the teasers sometimes differ so much from the actual song  my guess is that they make so many versions and they pick one final version  but the other versions are too good to never see the light of day so they use that as the teaser version  it doesn t bother me that much  i end up liking the song anyways  but the first time i experienced this discrepancy i felt so cheated  it s okay though  they included the alternate version in their album  ,0,464,87

i m not too interested in mv teasers  i find that although they might increase hype in the moment they also negatively affect my actual mv watching experience  i usually skip the non bts ones especially if they give away too much about the song  the hook chorus in particular   it feels so anticlimatic to me  so personally i appreciate that bh tries to make the teasers different from the way that part actually sounds in the song ,0,432,75

i second this  stadium venues are a whole different beast in the us and so these numbers look bad but when you think in total to the whole venue it s not awful as it seems  there d be sporadically unfilled seats but even that s not too noticeable in stadiums  bts have been gaining a lot of exposure and converting die hard fans is their thing  so as ticket prices get lower  the numbers will go down  nj s second date is the only concerning one but since it s a coastal city it should be okay in the long run  it s good to be proactive about letting people know they re on sale but don t stress too much ,0,605,114

 gt the period between the selling of tickets and the date of the actual concert kinda seems very short it s kind of the norm for them actually  i don t know why they do it but they do it  longer period doesn t seem to help because most fans will snatch up seats right away  if you talking about the public    i mean bts don t really advertise their tour either  so i m not sure if longer period would help since promoters rarely promote bts tour,0,446,82

based loosely on percy jackson by rick riordan beause i learened greek mythology more from his books than in school  lol    namjoon   son of athena for sure  i know you said to avoid cliche but i can t think of any other  cabin   reference to percy jackson  more apt to place namjoon than in the athena cabin  he breathes book and wisdom  also competitive    seokjin   son of poseidon  he is good in underwater swimming  water boarding  snow boarding  and likes fishing too  his easy going but serious and reliable in times of need personality also reminds me of percy  from the book     yoongi   son of hephaestus  he likes technology and likes fixing and building things  especially those that require the use of hands    hoseok   son of apollo  not because of the sunshine thing but because hobi is very versatile like how apollo is a god of almost everthing else  music  art  poetry  etc    jimin   son of hermes  he likes to update us via twitter and fancafe  and likes sharing bts photos of bts  ha    can be abit of a trickster too    taehyung   son of aphrodite  he has this sensual  striking kind of handsomeness like on how he strikes poses during shoots and projects on camera  he also gives me the impression that he gives importance to  aesthetics     jungkook   son of zeus or hades  honestly  going back to riordan s percy jackson series  jk reminds me of nico d angelo  son of hades  for some reason  maybe because nico is somewhat of an emo looking kid but is actually a total softie  but if we talk about what the gods are commonly known for  i feel like jk fits more to be a son of zeus because of the physical display of power ,0,1647,302

yes  that s what i love so much about them  they always continue to grow  innovate and experiment and do things they like rather than stay confined to a single style or genre  they are true innovators and artists  i think sometimes as army we are too hard on ourselves  with not be being able to keep the title track in the charts  i feel we re trying to measure success in a traditional sense  when bts have always achieved their success in anything but traditional paths  we got 2b spotify streams last year for their entire discography  we do really cherish their entire albums  rather than a single track  i m sure that really warms joon s heart too  knowing we truly appreciate and love their entire albums in this streaming era ,0,734,129

the amount of times i fought with people on that sub    lol like  when bts started booking all the us tv shows late 2017  basically  amas period  the comments were so passive aggressive and skeptical  they were saying that because wg snsd failed what makes bts think they can succeed   blah blah blah  and now everyone s arguing 2nd gen paved the way  massive eye roll ,0,369,63
i don t really talk about my hobbies if i m not asked because i don t really know if the other person is interested in the conversation  but when i am asked you bet i m always trying to promote bts  and kpop in general  to everyone  the older i got  the better i realised that i don t need  friends  who only mock my interests  people who want to spend their free time shaming others about things they like are pathetic  even if they do it  for fun   ,0,451,85
they are much quieter because no one can make a dispute about their achievement  it is a fact and published in credible media outlet and institution  and their hype and popularity is proven with their massive sales  the impact is visible  but i do believe any controversy about bts will make them comment faster than a bullet  always find a chance and fault about them  right now no one can do that since bts member never do anything morally wrong yet   and i do hope it stays that way ,0,486,88

yea i think that has got to do with waiting to see first how the demand was like before proceeding to add a second day  haha  if the first day shows didn t sell as fast as they did i m sure they wouldn t have add a 2nd day  i know what you mean though  it does make things more tedious in terms of transportation  thankfully i only booked my air tickets and hotels after managing to secure the tix i needed  but i do feel bad for those who booked theirs ahead of time   ,0,470,94

this makes me frustrated because i panicked and bought some bad nosebleeds at fv for the first day of nj after not being able to get the tickets i wanted    but i m extremely worried about not being able to sell mine off at fv after seeing all the under fv tickets selling on resellers so i gave up on trying to sell them at all   wish i would ve had the sense to think ahead  a lot of people correctly predicted the second days added but i was too focused in the moment  ,0,472,93

imo so much has gone downhill since ynwa  creativity wise  music which is the most important is still good but i m not sure why broke bh in 2015 16 had better ideas and execution  mvs  concept pics  styling  than now when they are rich    i think what they need is new people  amp  fresh ideas ,0,294,54
yep  look up  facial massages  and  facial exercises  on youtube  you look like an idiot doing them but they do help  figuring out where your trigger points are on your face  which will be different for everyone  helps release your facial muscles and makes your face more youthful and relaxed  for instance i have trigger points right around the base of my inner eyebrows  i have to roll my thumb along that bone until i find them  once i ve released them  my eyebrows relax and go up about a few cms  makes me go from slightly tense looking to happy and relaxed  i also have some right in the grove at the base of my cheeks  i guess it s a sinus trigger point   and one on the right notch along my jaw  near my ear   not only do i feel better after digging into those areas  but the corners of my mouth lift naturally  definitely worth a try if you haven t done it before ,0,873,163

aww is it always the same  that kinda    sucks    i just personally think this tour in particular is really not that properly planned out  the period between the selling of tickets and the date of the actual concert kinda seems very short  imo   and i agree that at this time around as a fan you really need to set aside a certain budget  it sucks for financially struggling fans  like me  but well that s life  speaking of  the ticketing experience for the wings tour was a fucking bloodbath in my country hahahahahha,0,518,92

ugh thank god that made me feel a lot better  yeah this tour was planned very poorly  they didn t even let the fans have enough time to save money and plan things if ever they are coming from far places  there s no setlist even  tho i know we re expecting a new album so new songs  i also agree with the tour bundles  imagine how much that can help the boys in bb charting  ughhhhhh ,0,383,74

 gt  they should give enough time for the fans to save money and purchase tickets  not all can shell out money that fast but u see  the concerts are months away  fans still have time to save up money to try and get tickets if they are really aiming for them  also  tbh tour announcements are always kinda sudden  this ain t the first time it s happening  fans should know by now that they need to set aside a certain budget  well  nothing will be as bad as wings tour announcement in 2016  us ticketing went on sale literally during the period where everyone had already spent their budget on christmas shopping  gt _ lt ,0,621,112
wow  just checked out stromae and i instantly understood why you recommended him  ,0,82,13
thank u for this    it s kinda reassuring that everything will be fine in the end  still  bighit should never do this sudden tour announcement again  they should give enough time for the fans to save money and purchase tickets  not all can shell out money that fast    ,0,269,48
was this really necessary  ,0,27,5
actually there s a lot of regular fans selling tickets too  we have the same situation for paris  a lot of people bought tickets for the first concert and then tried to get better tickets for the second one and ended up with too many  i m in a ton of group chats where other armys tried to sell their tickets for face value right after they bought them  i myself am trying to get rid of my paris ticket because i ended up with a better seat a few hours after i bought the first one  many people assumed selling unwanted tickets at face value would be as easy as last year and probably didn t think twice when buying additional tickets    ,0,638,120
actually  there are only 1k 2k resale tickets left for wembley and france  i don t know why it s like that for the us dates  but i agree  bighit s strategy for this tour is a huge mess  they didn t even do tour bundles for their us shows    what a waste   ,0,256,49
seokjin did say  money  in that oz interview and as rjs  parent   you betcha he d shear him for 24k bars   ,0,107,21
10 20 percent  i guess  is that a lot or pretty normal for artists performing in stadiums ,0,90,16
this actually isn t as bad as it could be  as bad as i ve seen some other concerts  a good amount of fans got tickets since these stadiums are like 50k capacity  the rose bowl shows especially are like a little over 10  only  i m confident a lot of these tickets will sell closer to the date  and even if they don t all go  it shouldn t be noticeable to the boys and that s what matters ,0,387,74
this is so cool ,0,16,4
i felt that seal approval for buying v4   ,0,42,9

i do think its gonna sold out  because similar thing happen when i tried to buy bts tickets in singapore from resell websites  that time its still more than 1month left from concert date and thousands of tickets still not sold out  however  i checked again during last or 2 week before concert dates  its selling super fast  i noticed that army are like to buy it last minute  maybe they are waiting for tickets that they want go lower  ,0,437,80
ohmygod that s a lot     0\_0 so it s not really  sold out  per se  not from the us but i hope they do not perform on a half  empty stadium    i personally think that a one day show is enough for each stop  except brazil  but scalpers got way too greedy this time around  kinda gave bighit the thinking that adding a second show is better to accomodate the  demand  i think the situation is the same for their wembley dates  here s to hoping that days before the concert these tickets will be sold  hoping their comeback at snl and possible performance\  at billboard will draw in new fans  eyeeeeee bighit s strategy for this speak yourself tour is a mess ,0,657,120
so like 10 percent got to scalpers huh  is that a decent guesstimate  ,0,70,13

i got a new job one month ago and i have a coleague sitting next to me that likes music a lot  he even sends me songs in the chat  but i don t know  he is the type of person that likes philosophy and doesn t listen to the songs on the radio  i kinda wanted to show off bts to him  but i try not to  i wanted to bring it up in a conversation about music   he also listened to cypher pt 4 cause i was a dumbass and unplugged my earphones and all my coleagues heard the song   but with his  superior  taste of music  i find it a bit hard to talk about bts  since you know the usual misconceptions  yesterday he asked me if they have plastic surgery i guess he tried to look them up online   and when i told he that they are going to release an album and told him that they got inspired from carl jung  he said   why would a korean group get inspired from jung  i don t believe it   i told him that the reason why i like them is because they have a message behind their music  not just random lyrics and he agreed that that s what he is looking for when listening to music  but sigh    he seems to have too many misconceptions and i don t really enjoy trying to explain people why i like bts or to try to show people that they are different  i think i m just going to enjoy them by myself  but the truth is  i didn t even tell my parents that i like bts  i said that i like a korean group and that i will go to their concert  but i didn t want to show myself as the fangirl i am  i guess it s kind of my problem  but at least i have friends who are themselves fans of korean groups and they understand me ,0,1601,323

thats really not true and its one of the things about the fan base that i find really extraneous  there is no rule that every single thing bts release is symbolic  90  of the fan theories nowadays are big straw grasps because there isnt anything actually that symbolic in bts  work  in the past  like during wings era and with things involving the hyyh universe it makes sense but beyond that its not necessary to expect every single thing to be symbolic imo,0,458,83

aww that s so sweet that your dad wants to go with you go the rosebowl  and it s awesome to hear that your husband is also army  also i forgot to mention that even though i am comfortable enough to chat about bts with friends and family  i am a bit self conscious in public  like i have a tata keychain that i wanted to wear to the burn the stage movie  but even then i took it off  i am also in my 30s so i think that i m self conscious about my age  even though i know i shouldn t be  i really hope that you find fellow armys in your office  ,0,544,111

i like to keep mine more private  i was pretty confident until i tried to get some of my friends into k pop  i got shot down and they gave me the usual stuff like   but you can t understand it    and giving me funny looks  most of the time i wouldn t be affected by this but i was because they were the best of the best friends to me so after that i kept my k pop vibes under the rug  i have tried getting some of my other friends into k pop after that and some success and i also managed to get one of the friends that was making fun of it into it  i am still pretty quiet about k pop but because of that when i finally get to talk about im pretty enthusiastic about it and reddit was a life saver to me   it s pretty hard to keep something you love quiet   and its amazing to see how many armys there are on reddit  it s great fun to talk with you guys ,0,855,175

it s a running joke on this sub but there could be a nugget of truth to it   nothing too specific  but there are many discussion and theory posts that in hindsight have lots of coincidental overlaps with bts concepts or activities  we know that bts bighit are aware of fan communities  i think it was in the burn the stage movie where mr  bang talked about american fans reactions at billboard  also back when bts were still accepting fan gifts the  annual census was turned into a book and sent to them  along with other projects like for members  birthdays  so they know this sub exists  haha i like to think they are watching us,0,631,115

i literally didn t tell anyone about my interest in bts other than random people on the internet people who wouldn t be in my life for  months   a few people close to me know now  and i d be willing to tell people  but i don t really talk about the extent of my fangirling and my love for them  i m just   embarrassed about it  and it s so different from my other interests that i don t really feel like it represents me or know how to deal with it  my main interests in the past have been largely book focused  and it s really different for me to be watching a lot of videos now and have little to no content for my interest that s not technology based  instead of reading a book for the main activity  i watch videos  read stuff online  or listen to music   this is in addition to the fact that i m used to having violent feelings about book characters  where they aren t real and completely obsessing over them can be a little odd but isn t really a problem  instead of real people who i don t actually personally know  where i feel like i need to be more cautious and i m also not really sure what would be acceptable to the people around me who aren t surrounded by bts fandom  for instance  i don t know if my family would take issue with my calling one of the members  my tiny baby boy  so i wouldn t use that kind of language around them  whereas i will call book characters  my tiny baby boy  with absolutely no hesitation  i m also kind of scared of being stigmatized for my interest by some people  and i really don t want to look like the kind of person that they d assume i was  i m just kind of overall embarrassed about it  so i don t really talk about them that much ,0,1683,310

i m fascinated by v  he reminds me of my dad a lot  and of myself at times  although he s much more innocent and untainted than me  but i identify with his eccentricity and inability to pass as normal  but being liked for it   untainted  was a word jimin used to describe him which i found so beautiful  i think in the last year though he a been the most burdened by fame and things like grief and sorrow out of them all  the way he broke down during that award show speech  it reminded me a lot of seeing bieber struggle publicly and openly admit to experiencing a dark night of the soul  v is a free spirit and cannot have his emotions or feelings stifled  i think one of the reasons he enjoys acting is because it s one of the times he doesn t stutter or stumble on his words  i remember an interview where they were asked about the differences between korean and american talk shows and he mentioned that in america there s fewer hierarchies based on factors like age and seniority  i feel like this is something he d really appreciate  being the kind of informal guy who loves to randomly scream and walks off camera mid interview to pee  i hope his beautiful  unique spirit is never diminished by the trials of life and fame  ,0,1232,226

youtube channel that does [kpop explained by a korean]   their [ddaeng explained]   video blew up  ,0,99,15
rm is extremely well spoken in korean and i feel like a lot of his eloquence is unfortunately lost in translation or when he speaks in english  he comes across as very confident  well read  and thoughtful  v is the complete opposite  haha  especially in formal settings  i always hold my breath when he comes up to the mic cause when he says something  wrong   you can tell he beats himself up about it  i think it s more nerves than anything but he does have a tendency to use odd words or phrases to get his point across  there s a reason korean fans have even come up with a term for the way he speaks  taetae language   when he s just with his group mates  he sounds much more natural and carefree  suga is very direct and blunt  jimin   just the way he talks is so fucking cute it hurts  especially when he s doing vlives  but a more impish  bullish personality comes through when he s not simply catering to fans and just having fun with the guys  jungkook just sounds like the maknae   which makes the nunas  like me  see him perpetually as a kid  haha  he also has a very faint lisp that comes out every once in a while  i don t know whether it s real or he just does it to sound cuter but if it s the latter it s working  jhope is also kinda like suga in that he s pretty direct and to the point with his words but whereas suga is monotone and deadpan  jhope is the exact opposite  he s very cheery  very bright  full of energy  jin is kinda whiny and immature but obviously in a playful manner  he likes to keep things light and not too serious  but he is very polite and respectful when not with the boys  when he s mcing  on variety  etc   i feel like a lot of this can be conveyed even without understanding korean but that s my impression of the way they speak off the top of my head ,0,1798,334

the attic ceiling in version 3 reminds me more of jung s dream house and how it functions as a symbol for the human psyche or soul  each story in the symbolic house corresponds to a level in the psyche and in this metaphor  the top floor and most superficial layer represents the persona  the personas depicted here though are ones that are consuming and inflexible  like you said  their body language conveys a certain artifice  it s as if they have evolved personalities that are all personas and this is no further accentuated in version 4 where they find themselves weighed down in the campiest accessories and colors and patterns  posing like classic antiquity figures  their literal demographic opposites  young  alive  and  asian vs  old  dead  and western   taking a step back  we can also find evidence of the supersession of the specific personas in the decreasing number of individual photos  we start with 22  then go to 5  2  then 1 from version 1 to 4  the mood of the concept photos also follow the same trend  version 1 starts off the most playful  version 2 we get a tonal shift in the main panel of the individual photo and group photo  et cetera  ,0,1166,204

i love the pink  one of them looks very flamingo and the other a bit uncomfortably like scrubbed flesh  still  that pink is going to look good next to the ly albums on my shelf especially since they look like the same dimensions  if we get pastel purple and blue for shadow and ego  i m not complaining in the slightest  i thought we d get something a little different  but it honestly makes sense  i remember they got extra support or something to pull off fulfillment printing the packaging for ly answer   so whatever deal they worked out  it probably was better to stick with  this is probably more economical in design since they have over 2 5mil orders to print  and hey maybe the cover is going to line up ly era and shadow ego like a treasure map of the soul with a bit x marking the spot lol,0,800,147

 gt last time with answer  none of the concept pictures even hinted at idol  their look for it  concept and song iirc  so i don t think these new concept pictures mean they won t have a more hip hop style title track  lol actually the fact that the cb trailer was that way is what makes me think we ll be deprived of a hip hop title track  that s what i m thinking as well  since the intro is a callback to the previous album  that s it  the job is already done  this is how they all went  intro   statement  title track  different sound  i don t think the rest of the album will call back to the earlier bangtan sound  i m surprised how many people think so tbh   i d love to be wrong though  ,0,694,131

i personally think that it precisely because of wing era  people notice bts member individual strength and how they are complimenting each other as a group  this is one of the reason they growing this far and become this big ,0,225,40
for me almost nobody knows  i don t have any friends irl and people i talk to online mostly aren t into kpop actively dislike it as a music genre  even my family doesn t know mostly because i think them not knowing doesn t really matter to me or to them  if someone would ask me if i like bts kpop in general i probably would tell them depending on who it is but i certainly wouldn t start off conversations with  do you know bts  ,0,431,80
this is the most brazenly fangirlish a company has been over bts,0,64,12
true  there will be endless complain after this especially when the title track came out  sometime people forget the strength of bts is not lie only on their title title but the whole album  but this is what make them special right  as long as you like most of the song  i don t see any problem   preference of everyone will never be the same  i m just enjoying the ride  ,0,372,68

well  no one can satisfy everyone at this point   everyone has their own taste  not everyone is the same  comparison with past album will be endless so does their music  it happen in all their comeback  it will be endless discussion   because it happen everytime they make a comeback  some like it while some not but it does not change the part that bts team work hard for this album  just like rm said  they are 7different people with 7 different taste  preference while looking at 7 different direction  but they are complimenting each other to make bts come this far  just enjoy the ride and look forward what bts will offer this time with their music  i personally think their concept photo is a great transition from ly series  not to drastic but with flow ,0,762,134

if you like \[pretty much anything by bts\]  you will like \[pretty much anything by stromae\] dear me  all i want is a stromae   bts collab  to everyone who has never checked out stromae in general do it  he doesn t have a huge number of songs  but he has great  socially conscious lyrics  french  and unique instrumentals  but i guess if i am going to play this right  i will try to pick a few songs out specifically  [ave cesaria]   little unconventional here  but i am going to compare this to idol for some of the instrumental choices   but french [batard]   sounds a bit like boyz with fun to me  [quand c est ]   music video is as artistic as fake love  okay  introducing people to new music is one of my favorite things  so this may get too long  i apologize  but i hope someone finds a new artist or song out of this  i am going to change things up for the  i don t listen to kpop besides bts  people and not include other kpop tracks  but that doesn t mean you can t check out the other suggestions by other people on this list    [it s a man s world]   by james brown this track was sampled in agust d  so why not get to know the original track  dope  [la pluie]   by orelson ft  stromae  french   chosen for those sick saxophone lines that come in the chorus like the horn line in dope  cypher series give it to me [everybody dies]    explicit  by logic  another rapper bragging about coming from nothing to something  but logic has a similar philosophical base that bts has and similar experiences with anxiety and depression autumn leaves  or just tae s soulful tone and you wish he sang about happy things  [twist]   by nathan sykes  this is a little more upbeat and popish  it s like if pop and soul had a baby  love is not over [craving]   by matt woods soft vocals that kind of feel like they are reaching out for something rain outro  do you think it makes sense  [blind man]   by xavier omar  smooth 90s r amp b vibes  run [home ft  walk the moon]   by morgxn  the chorus just gives me run vibes  the repeating notes in the chorus just do it  this one has more of a bass feel than run  but i like it  epiphany [thursday]   by jess glynne  beautiful vocals and all about learning to love yourself  paradise  airplane pt 2 [valentino]   by years and years and mnek  similar guitar to airplane pt 2  and includes mnek  who helped write paradise young forever  you never walk alone [jag ar fri]   by jon henrik fjallgren  swedish   manages to be sweeping  epic  and emotional at the same time ddaeng daydream  weird combo  i know  [barbie]   by static and ben el  hebrew   uses traditional sounds for something more modern  not the greatest lyrics  but super catchy and upbeat  whew  that s enough  crossing my fingers for future bts music that sounds anything like all of my old school motown or funk playlists  i tried to force them in here  but just couldn t find enough similarities to slip them in   ,0,2921,508

i wouldn t just drop it as a line of conversation out of nowhere  but on the topic of music most definitely  i admire and respect them just as well as any of the artists in my album collection  quality music is quality music  and any judgement that someone else might have built on a preconception of bts is on them  if they aren t interested in knowing why i respect bts  no big deal  it s ok not to share the same interests as everyone else and if that style of music isn t their bag i m sure there is something else would could talk about     if they show interest in why i admire them so much  i ll share that with them  it brings me a great deal of joy to listen to their music  so why not share that  in my eyes  i m just trying to share something that brings a little shine to my life  if someone is curious enough and wants to find out that much about bts  honey you know i m your girl for it  honestly  i m proud of being a bts fan and army  i think the boys are bringing something uplifting to a weary world while also legitimately making history  it will be cool to look back on that years from now and know that you were in some small way a part of it all  as a lifelong fan of music it feels really exciting  my rule of thumb is  i am always willing to share those things that make me happiest in life with others  but only if invited   and henny if y all invite me in and go there you just might be 100  responsible for the sheer outpouring of music videos  run episodes  and youtube crackhead compilations that may follow    ,0,1540,297
i wanna go too since i actually live in las vegas and that seems the only way i can see them since they don t come here when touring  but i really don t listen to the other people playing and bts would only do one song and probably be the last so i m not so sure  if my cousin gets a free ticket though  then i ll probably go  ,0,327,67
bts has it s own color pallette  right from the beginning  black and white  blue and pink  and  so far  that s pretty much it  somebody messed up with skool luv affair having pink letters on a green blackboard  when it should have been red letters on a black blackboard  but  other than that blip      completely consistent   amp  x200b      the school years       mainly black and white with a few splashes of pink red  and the bulletproof vest  plus red lettering on solid black for dark and wild     the best moments in life       light pink and light blue  butterfly motif   white  hot air balloon  plus white logos on solid black for wings \[the soft and sweet  dreamy  moments of adolescence\]    amp  x200b      love yourself       white with blue pink lettering and flower motif  black with white lettering and flower motif  blue pink with white lettering and flower motif   not sure why we were surprised to get lots of pink for persona  and i m still not convinced that we re entirely done with the love yourself era   amp  x200b  me thinks the next big color scheme will involve a lot of light blue with some black white and pink    ,0,1144,196

i m not a big fan of pink but actually love the shades they picked  i have to agree with the criticism on the design   i just feel meh about it  i feel like if they went with a different design the whole concept and color scheme could have been better and it would have been separated more from the ly series  maybe something like the outline of a mask  but again  maybe it is supposed to have similarities to the ly as a transition departure into the new series  that being said  i already preordered all 4 versions so   that s how little weight the negatives have against the positives lol ,0,592,107
if they don t get nomination other than tsa  it s better if they are not coming  but we still get them tsa award  come on they are at no 1 for a whole year  no way other artist can get them  just provide a thank you clip for video receiving the award  if they do get a nomination  though i hope they can win  but if they are not winning is also ok for me because being nominated alone is an achievement ,0,403,81

i generally agree with almost all the things above except i think hobi would be more hestia  warmness to bangtan  or hera   mother like  tendencies to the maknaes   zeus would more be like namjoon as the leader of bts  i would sometimes switch taehyung and jungkook due to taehyung s appreciation for the arts  especially unconventional or unique ones  and jungkook s athleticism  hermes was a known patron for athletics back in ancient greece   also  if you look at one of the dispatch idol shoots for bts  an individual taehyung pic   the one that was used by tc chandler to rank their 100 most handsome men of 2018  he gives me apollo vibes  especially with the idol hairstyle   i agree for yoongi  but for some weird reason  he gives me hades vibes as well  also  any army s or bts fans who liked percy jackson  amp  the olympians series  permy s lol     where are y all at    ,0,881,151

if you dig rapline  i would strongly suggest listening to those they ve cited as inspirations for a good look at the foundation of their style  if you re a fan of chill  funky songs like rain  her  or 134340  check out epik high  the new ep sleepless in__________ is great   highly recommend along with remapping the human soul   j cole also has a lot of touching songs that have that chill vibe  change is the first one i can think of  the delivery and storytelling is amazing  even his hits like no role modelz have a really strong message while maintaining a cooled down vibe  the album 2014 forest hills drive definitely inspired rapline   2pac songs such as keep ya head up  changes  and ghetto gospel are awesome as well because of their story  and namjoon especially seems to be inspired on some level by 2pac s flow  of course  we can t forget about the king of chill rap  drake  i d recommend listening to nothing was the same and take care for a good look at the music predebut rapline was listening to and learning from  drake s flow and lyricism  while a little overhyped  is really moving and powerful  if you like some of their  harder  stuff  eg rm or the cyphers  the above artists are still worth listening to  but i d also add kendrick lamar to the list  to pimp a butterfly is on the chiller side  while damn  is a little harder hitting  kendrick  like the other artists on this list  is a master of telling a story and inspiring emotion through rap  this is in no way a comprehensive list of every single thing that inspired bts s rapline  but i listed some artists i think are really great for exploring hip hop further than just bts if that s what you re into ,0,1682,301

people love the balls to the wall gritty hyper conceptualized stuff  and then they build their expectations around that  the s version pics from answer is actually my favorite set of bts concept photo s ever because of it s blatant themes  but honestly there s no need for that type of image to be recreated over and over again  what s the point  all these concept photo s need to do is portray the themes of the album  they re a visual companion to the style of songs we ll hear on the tracklist  and the lack of darker colors might be because that type of imagery doesn t belong on this album  if they re dressed up all pastel and colorful then they re telling you that s what you should expect of this album  ,0,712,124

sticking to k pop here since i only listen to a bit of j rock indie stuff  which is almost worlds apart  and occasionally stuff on the regular us u k  charts  which most people would probably already know  otherwise    if you like their old ballads such as     just one day  coffee       etc  then i d recommend    let me by got7  this was composed by one of the members and has a very 00 s rnb hip hop vibe    nct s limitless ep   in particular  the tracks angel  back 2 u and       angel definitely has a very similar sound and feel to     in my opinion  if you liked ma city  am i wrong and      look here  not sure how to describe these but they definitely have the same fast paced not quite jazzy but similar style   i d recommend    shall we dance by block b   show me by key   dramarama by monsta x  a lot of their other discography is good if you liked not today but it s a bit too heavy for me a lot of the time hahaha      exo s tempo and growl because i believe in inter fandom and world peace    if you liked stigma and singularity  i d recommend    jonghyun s she is album  in particular orbit and moon  orbit has a very jazzy instrumental and moon has a similar vibe due to jonghyun s vocals    jun k s discography   especially no shadow  mary poppins and mr no    nct u s 7th sense and baby don t stop    tvxq s something  mirotic and truth  i kinda wanna include champagne too due to the vocals but i feel like that gives more of a j hope dance track vibe  especially with the rap verse    four seasons by taeyeon  not usually a big fan of her music  it s  good  but kinda generic to me a lot of the time  but her latest single is really really catchy and well sung   if you liked their happy  pop  tracks like euphoria  i d recommend    astro s all night album  favourites are moonwalk  1 in a million and merry go round   moonwalk isn t very similar euphoria but it s my favourite track from the album so i m including it anyway   their old music has a similar happy style but is the instrumentals are more similar to what you d get for softer rock music than pop    jj project s on amp on and find you    a lot of shinee s more recent discography  especially songs such as        countless  chemistry and        no clue what the english title for that one is   chemistry kinda borderline reminds me of bst for some reason too    print by hotshot   home by seventeen if you re a fan of their faster hip hop rap based tracks  e g  mic drop     silver spoon  no more dream  the cyphers  etc    i d recommend    mino s solo album  especially trigger    ateez s discography  especially hala hala and say my name   rewind by got7   stray kids  i am who album  especially question and my pace  a lot of their discography is focused on topics that bts also touches on so i d recommend them if you like bts for that sort of reason    lay s older solo stuff  although i d be a bit careful since a lot of his stuff ventures into the type of lyrics you d find in typical american hip hop these days   most of it is a mix of english and chinese but he separated the two for his recent album  which has a more tropical sound   sheep and boss are really good tracks musically although i can never listen to them without smiling laughing  ,0,3242,594

i agree  i also study japanese history at university and most of the students in my classes are students who major in the language and sure  a lot of them like anime  manga and  weirdly enough  a good 70  of them have dyed their hair a really eccentric colour  i m not even kidding  i don t know what it is but i ve only seen pink  blue and green haired students in my japanese classes  anyway  i remember at the beginning of the year in my first lecture  we only had 40 ish students so my professor went around and asked what everyone s reasoning was for taking the course  most said either japanese media  including manga anime other tv shows music   food or the culture in general  surprisingly a lot of people were bold enough to say they took it because of manga anime  in that class  however  when a person replied with anime manga  my professor nodded and laughed it off casually  i guess it s common  my point is  it surprised me that everyone felt at ease saying their real reasons  where as in my korean classes  your almost an outcast if you mention bts or the more popular groups  some people in my classes are ridiculously elitist   aka  only the  old generation groups have any talent  and bts is just a fad etc   it s shocking the difference between the two classes actually now that i think about it  ,0,1317,233

agreed  i m teaching myself korean and i love the culture but it s not because of bts  they started my passion the first time i ever heard korean was through their songs  but i fell in love with the language and people on my own time  in my own search and studying  i have no idea why but korean just  clicked  with me and i ve been hooked ever since  i ve studied and learned other languages  and i ve always been interested in other cultures  but korean everything hit me and somehow it feels like home to me  i love my country  i love my culture  and i will never not be american  but there s something about south korea that just feels right in my soul  it s a weird sensation and it s very hard to explain to others  i once looked up  why am i learning a language i ll never use   in google because i wondered if somehow i was wasting my time on a pointless pursuit  despite getting joy out of it  i came across a forum post that asked that very question and the replies were what i needed  countless people were encouraging the op to keep going and that nothing is by chance  including your interests  people were saying they loved a certain culture or language only to live or do business with that culture years later into their careers or maybe they met and married someone from that country  so now when i get comments about my love for korean things  i just think about how my passion will make sense one day  one thing i ve learned over 28 years is that god always has great things planned for us where and when we least expect it ,0,1543,286
that s true  what irks me the most is when people think i chose my degree major due to being a bts fan  not that i m learning korean specifically  but that i chose to spend my an important part of my life doing korean at university level  or any language  for a boy group  or other form of entertainment   i know a lot of people who study korean  japanese etc purely for kpop jpop  or japanese for the manga anima and korean for the kdramas   even i started learning korean because of my interest in the music  the rap r amp b side surprisingly   and i started out learning as a hobby  but soon realised more to the korean culture  hence deciding to further my studies  same goes for my japanese language studies   i don t even watch anime read mangas  boasting about loving bts  for me  is something i want to keep separate from my studies because bts isn t the reason i started learning  sure  they re a factor in what kept me motivated  but that s not the whole story  however  as soon as i tell someone in my university  who knows my degree  that i like kpop  they jump on the  crazy obsessed fan  bandwagon  and it doesn t help that when bbc  radio 1 i think  did that documentary  they decided to put the interview of the girl who literally moved to south korea for bts despite not knowing the language  that documentary got shown in my modern korean history lecture and literally everyone laughed  i admire her for her passion and love for the boys and i m more than sure she is a lovely person  but i think moving to another country purely for a boy group is too much  ,0,1577,282

personally  i only mention it if someone brings them up  or k pop in general  it s very sad  but most people are not open minded when it comes to this genre of music  they almost always think that the artists have no talent  that they re just handsome faces  blah  blah  blah  don t get me wrong  i m a proud army  and will shout it from the rooftops if needed  but mostly  i just keep it quiet unless someone shows interest  real interest ,0,440,79

i m flying over to their offices and setting them on fire if bts doesn t get a music nom  we have the stats to back it up  literally the only reason they wouldn t nom them for something is xenophobia plain and simple ,0,217,41
i m 31 and i couldn t help myself and i talked about them at my office  actually   my screensaver is a photo of them i took at staples last year  they asked about it  i answered  once  and then my coworkers bring it up  over and over  someone brought me the ew cover today   amp  x200b  it s nice  but i also get treated a bit like an oddity  it s like being a vegetarian  i never bring it up myself but once people know it about me  they ask me about it 3 times a week and then assume i talk about it all the time  it s annoying  but i ve learned to embrace it  i love bts  and i think other people should give them a chance  if that means dealing with weird  sometimes judgmental  but usually very earnest questions about them  i ll answer it  ,0,746,143

i don t flaunt it nor necessarily  hide  that i m a bts fan  a lot of people at my high school like bts like i do and i have a mang plushie keychain on my backpack  my phone case has shooky on it  one girl asked me one time if i drew it hahaha   and hoseok is my background on my phone  i listen to music a lot and it s mostly bts and some other kpop groups  but no one really says anything  i did get a girl in my bio class one time tell me   oh you re  that  kind of person  when i was minding my own business  listening to outro  wings like any other person would        there are people i know that they know i like bts but there is no true way i have of showing i m a fan except the   you only know if you know    ,0,719,150
i definitely know that i lucked out with the fact that my husband is just as into bts as i am    it would be so incredibly tough for me to not be able to constantly express my joy over them with him since we are together all the time  it was no surprise to my parents family when they discovered my love of bts  i grew up loving nkotb  bsb  nsync    then later was even into one direction  did not shock anyone that i would fall for these guys as well  haha ,0,458,91

i know it s a common choice for him amongst the fandom  but i honestly don t think he relates in anyway to her personality  she was always said to have been one of the most ill tempered and easily offensive gods  i think dionysus is a good choice for jimin  he represents a certain point of desire and pleasure  and he was known for being lighthearted and helpful  ,0,365,66
ahhh i love these  they re so satisfying to look at \ \_\ ,0,58,11
it s definitely a secret  my mom  dad and brother know about it  and i even tried to get my brother to listen to their music  with no good results haha  but they ve always known about my fangirl side  i don t think they care anymore  once when i was talking to one of my best friends she mentioned that her sister loves k dramas  so i told her i like korean music  and she was super weirded out about it  because of the language  so i never talked about it ever again lol  the other day she told me she watched meteor garden  so hopefully she s getting over it  me and my friends don t really talk about music that much  since they are not really into it  but if any of them were to ask me  i ,0,693,135

while i like the designs  i feel like it s too close to the ly era  would ve liked to see something completely different in terms of album cover and also packaging mechanics  size  shape  unfolding mechanics etc    this feels too safe from a design perspective  they could ve been a bit more adventurous  a little disappointed in terms of design   ,0,348,58
you live only once  so live st its fullest    may be  too much bangtan  will do wonders for you   ,0,98,21
that s what people usually associate with him but idk i don t see it  aphrodite for me was more about love than lust and jimin doesn t strike me as a romantic guy  dionysos is great imo because he s all about happiness and letting loose and that fits my image of jimin ,0,269,50
i get this feeling of woo  it s real  irl fans exist outside the concerts  an instant connection  you know  even though the people i see sporting the merch are usually at 10 15 years younger than i am  please flaunt your merch proudly  ,0,236,43

i didn t see an answer to this  but if we pre order from the usa bighit site  do we get those preorder gifts too  or is it just from the regular bight site  i bought 2 from target but now i m wondering if i should buy some from the usa bighit site for the gifts    ,0,265,54
i ve always been a pretty private person  so my interest in bangtan is really private  my boyfriend knows  but we live together  my parents don t know  we live several states apart  but they re going to find out during their next visit when they see my albums posters  i work from home and have minimal contact with other employees  i usually use bts bt21 wallpapers on my phone  i would like to get a keychain pins and then maybe other army can identify me in the wild  ,0,471,83
i keep it low key private  i m an adult who works in a hospital so it s not really appropriate to bring bts up in our setting       however i found out one of my coworkers knows them so we had a nice chat about it  same thing outside of work  i ll wear my little rj bag clip and i have a cooky phone case but i m not constantly bringing it up or yelling it from the rooftop lol ,0,378,77

[  here s an excerpt from the link    the birth of tragedy     summary   artistic creation depends on a tension between two opposing forces  which nietzsche terms the  apollonian  and the  dionysian   apollo is the greek god of light and reason  and nietzsche identifies the apollonian as a life  and form giving force  characterized by measured restraint and detachment  which reinforces a strong sense of self  dionysus is the greek god of wine and music  and nietzsche identifies the dionysian as a frenzy of self forgetting in which the self gives way to a primal unity where individuals are at one with others and with nature  both the apollonian and the dionysian are necessary in the creation of art  without the apollonian  the dionysian lacks the form and structure to make a coherent piece of art  and without the dionysian  the apollonian lacks the necessary vitality and passion  although they are diametrically opposed  they are also intimately intertwined  nietzsche suggests that the people of ancient greece were unusually sensitive and susceptible to suffering and that they refined the apollonian aspect of their nature to ward off suffering  the primal unity of the dionysian brings us into direct apprehension of the suffering that lies at the heart of all life  by contrast  the apollonian is associated with images and dreams  and hence with appearances  greek art is so beautiful precisely because the greeks relied on the appearances generated by images and dreams to shield themselves from the reality of suffering  the early  doric period of greek art is dull and prim because the apollonian influence too heavily outweighs the dionysian  the greek tragedies of aeschylus and sophocles  which nietzsche considers to be among humankind s greatest accomplishments  achieve their sublime effects by taming dionysian passions by means of the apollonian  greek tragedy evolved out of religious rituals featuring a chorus of singers and dancers  and it achieved its distinctive shape when two or more actors stood apart from the chorus as tragic actors  the chorus of a greek tragedy is not the  ideal spectator   as some scholars believe  but rather the representation of the primal unity achieved through the dionysian  by witnessing the fall of a tragic hero  we witness the death of the individual  who is absorbed back into the dionysian primal unity  because the apollonian impulses of the greek tragedians give form to the dionysian rituals of music and dance  the death of the hero is not a negative  destructive act but rather a positive  creative affirmation of life through art ,0,2609,417

i m honestly kind of private  i got teased for liking  weird  things in middle school and when i got into kpop it turned into this shameful thing i hid from everybody  my friends know about it now and i m not afraid to talk about it  but it s not exactly information that i ll willingly share with strangers  you gotta ask the right thing for me to disclose that  i don t wear anything that blatantly says  bts  but i do use wear merch that might be recognizable by other fans  like the love myself necklace and a chimmy keychain   ,0,532,97
most definitely flaunt it  like i wear my armyness like a badge lol  alright  i m not that insufferable  except to my family   but like how music is usually brought up in conversation  i make sure to mention them  i remember this other time i was preoccupied so the till operator asked me what i was listening to and i wrote the name of the song and artist down for him and i told him i d check how he liked it the next day  i remember i once told a waitress that i would order something extra   dessert if they played a bts song and it was medium busy at the time  to be honest  i like them a lot and i want to so badly make them achieve their full potential  in order to do that  i want to do my bit in promo ,0,711,145

i keep it low key  also sorry for the long post below  when i was into jrock kpop in high school i wasnt a weeb or kboo but i was  that girl  if u know what i m taking about  im very self conscious about talking about my interests as an adult because i m scared ill infodump too much and it comes off as cringey to a lot of people  i would never answer a staff questionaire like op  i work at a middle school and i play kpop playlists in my little office because no one really minds or questions it  but i don t go out talking about how much i love bts to my coworkers  i didn t even have any pictures of them up on my walls but i would just play their music all the time  but when the kids who do like kpop found out tho oh mannn  they all wanted to know who my bias is and what songs i like and literally the next day they came in with pictures of yoongi for my cork boards  i have so many pictures of bts yoongi up from pictures kids have gifted me now that my boss thought it was my boyfriend lmao  occasionally i ll get a student who asks  you listen to that asian group do u know what theyre saying  etc  and i don t bite into it bc i ve been dealing with those type of comments for over 10 years now so it s w e  i made a special connection with two of students because we re all hispanic and are into kpop and they re getting teased and bullied for liking something different and it hit so close to home because i was that girl at their age  i m gonna miss them so much when they go to high school and i wish i could afford to take them to the concert in may  my coworkers were really supportive when i said i was taking a day off to try to get tickets  i rarely take off work so when i asked for a day off they wanted to find out why lol  they re really excited for me that i m going to see them and it s nice to work at such a supportive and open minded environment  at work i do wear my bt21 hoodie when it s cold and i have a shooky charm or backpack  it s not a big deal people know i like bts and it s chill ,0,2022,411

as i get older  i care less and less about what others think about my hobbies and interests  i ve just started to feel like it s ridiculous for me to feel self conscious about things that bring me such genuine joy and happiness  and bts is no exception  i ve only been army since november but i ve been pretty open about how much i love them with the people around me  i have gotten some of the typical reactions you would expect  and i just shrug it off  it s funny because i m the kind of person who spends way too much time worrying about what other people think of me  to the point of social anxiety  but this particular aspect is one that genuinely doesn t bother me now  growing up  i never  grew out  of things that most people think a guy should grow out of  like collecting action figures  watching animated shows  and playing a lot of video games  on top of that  i used to be self conscious about my music taste as well  because pop music gets looked down on a lot if you re a guy  not to mention how i tend to pick female characters in video games way more often than the male ones  so i guess i ve just had a lot of experience defending my hobbies  after a point you just get tired of feeling ashamed of those things ,0,1230,232

agreed  i understand why you get the feeling they are half assing it but i am not someone who really cares about the concept photos as long as they put out good music  i do like your idea namjoon idea though and maybe they do have something planned along those lines for the other albums in the series  it s my first comeback with them so i don t really understand how these concept photos are connected to the mv and the music  i always thought they were just aesthetically pleasing photos for fans who get the album  also  people on this subreddit are pretty open to everyone s opinions  it s definitely not like stan twitter or youtube ,0,639,114

this  if they perform and get a real nomination how can i not  if that ends up happening lets go together haha ,0,111,22
oooo i feel like an easy way to achieve this is if they put a high sensitivity mic somewhere on the the light stick  i have an led light strip that has this type of mic thing connected to it and when set to music sync mode  the lights blink with music and can change into a combination of colors with a phone app ,0,313,64
someone mentioned this before  but it would be cool if it was synced to a  master light  that bts owns  whenever they flash their light stick  every army s lightstick will also flash  and we can know that somewhere in the world they re thinking of us  also  a feature to let it become a lamp  maybe if you unscrew the handle and attach it to a stand instead  ,0,359,67
i don t really talk about bts much but i have fanmade bts items like a keychain and a few enamel pins that i have on my backpack  i want to get a bt21 shirt from hot topic but they re kinda expensive for just a t shirt    if someone asks what music i listen to i tell them about bts and i ve mentioned ticketing struggles with some of my classmates  i also have a few posters up in my room for decoration and albums on my shelf but sadly no one really sees my room except for my apartment mate  who is also an army  and a few close friends,0,539,109

i started off super closeted because i didn t understand the whole army and bias thing   like i was nervous to make them my phone background haha  i guess i felt weird because i m in my late 20s and i ve never been obsessed with something like this since i was a kid  now a lot more people know i love them  i only really shout it from my twitter and art instagram when it comes to social media  you ll see a post here and there on my facebook page and personal instagram  but that s it  i gladly wear my merch and have pins and keychains on my bag hoping another army will see hahaha  i was shy at first  but i m not anymore ,0,626,121

recently i ve decided to risk it all and post bangtan memes on my ig story  every single day  several times  my ig is private for friends only and so far noone cares  i don t post thirsty content there though  i have a separate closed off twt account for that  also  literally almost everyone at my workplace knows  because i had to share my struggles of getting the tickets for la concert  i have 2 phone cases with mang and rj rings on them that i use everyday  also my phone lockscreen and 2 messangers  backgrounds are bts and yoongi respectively  i needed to show a text message to one of my managers yesterday and kinda forgot that i have persona ver 1 concept photo of yoongs as my background  he didn t even comment on that  ,0,733,136

i have a  don t ask don t tell  policy  so if anyone asks me if i like kpop  i have no shame telling them i love it  and if they ask about bts  i tell them i love them too  so far most of my coworkers are aware i love kpop but not so much my love for bangtan  i fangirl with my cousins but i tend to stay low profile if i talk to my bf or other relatives about it as they all have this prejudice that kpop insane fangirl     ,0,425,91

everyone i know knows  lmfao  i want to say that i don t necessarily flaunt it  but i guess that d be a lie since i wear a bts beanie and bookbag on the regular  it s pretty lowkey  both just say  bts  on it   i blast their music when i m at work so all my co workers and even many of my regular customers know that i love them  i ve never been good at hiding my interests from people  tbqh  ,0,392,77

i m a quiet person in general so i d say i m low key  but apparently i m not with the way everyone teases me about it and acts as if i m wearing a shirt with their faces emblazoned on it  shorts with bts across the butt  and regularly waltz around the office with their cardboard cutouts  i really don t hide it though  i even listed bts bt21 for gift options when we did secret santa at work two years running  i took a few days off and flew to ft  worth for their concert last year and a few coworkers knew why  when i got back  everyone  knew  apparently  while i was gone  one of my coworkers decided to have a  let s check out who ennui is going to see  you ll get a kick out of this   viewing party for the office  when i got back  another coworker who was telling me about it just couldn t wrap her mind around it  she was like   i mean  it s cool  it s just not what i expected  when they said you went to tx   i was just surprised  when she said you were going to a concert  i thought you were going to see somebody like beyonce    ,0,1041,201

definitely shouting from the rooftops with family and friends but at work i think i m somewhere in the middle  i m pretty open about it if asked  but outside of my office bestie i don t really talk about them much  i do have an rj cushion in my office for my chair along with a tata keychain for my work keys  i did have a pretty funny exchange with my boss the first time he saw the tata keychain  boss  blah  blah blah  work blah blah me   pulls out work keys  boss    blah  blah  work  bl excuse me  what the hell is that  me  it s an alien  boss  oh  i thought it was a kidney  ,0,582,113
i m always telling my family and best friends about exciting news about bts but other than that  i don t really try to bring them up  i ll gladly talk about them if people make observations and ask about them  by observations  i mean i have a tata keychain on my keys and i wore a ddaeng shirt to work the day i went to the concert and coworkers have asked about those things lol  my coworkers and boss now know i listen to korean music and am a fan of that one impressive korean boyband that was on tv  yeah haha  then again    i also wear bt21 bts stuff out in public on casual days  have a love yourself decal on my car  have a plush shooky bag charm hanging from my rear view mirror and use a shooky insulated water bottle daily    but that s just to hopefully call attention to any army out in the wild that want to say hi lol,0,831,161

i keep my love for bts as secret as i can  i dont actively hide it but it s not a topic of conversation unless someone asks  being where i live  surrounded by many asians  not in asia  and going to a school where i study korean as my degree major  being a kpop fan    while it isn t looked down upon  i get countless  ohhh    just another crazy fan  type of looks and i ve had too many people comment that i m only studying korean at university level because of bts   when in reality i m doing it because i want to study economics at a korean university  i love bts but i wouldn t dedicate 4 years of my life to a university degree purely because of them   the crazy fan  perception has hurt me in the past and i m not about to let it kill more of my self esteem  like i said though  i don t actively hide it  i have a jungkook keyring and bts as my lockscreen  and i blast their albums from my dorm room  but it s not a conversation starter by any means  i don t really even talk to my  asian  boyfriend about bts or kpop because he hasn t yet abandoned his  crazy fangirl  perception that he got from seeing a lot of korean kpop fans  ,0,1137,216
yes   ice her   i know it s not right but it s what i end up singing  ,0,70,15
obvious without saying anything   is another way of promo  make them curious enough to ask and that s when start subtle promo w  lyricism talk  meaning in their message  throw in some funny stories or heartfelt stories  maybe set up a song playing just low enough to be heard but not loud enough to annoy them  and give a few song recommendations depending on their music likes  gotta be patient and not too eager  the reading their poems around the campfire in runbts is one of my favorite moments to share w  ppl who ask about the very obvious hints i m carrying  it s heartfelt  ,0,582,105
haha i laughed so hard at your questionnaire answers  you re awesome  i m generally a secretive person about everything but i certainly wouldn t hide it  i proudly wear my merch and  much to my friends  dismay  refuse to shut up about my undying dedication  i ve noticed that there s something about loving bts in particular that makes me bold  like  i can t be ashamed of my enthusiasm for them  no way ,0,404,69

same  people still tend to be close minded in india when it comes to k pop  the first time i introduced bts s music to my boyfriend he had the same response as most people  who are these girls   he used to get a bit annoyed when i would talk about them or blast their music in his car but now idol is his jam  mic drop his hype song and euphoria his feel good song  my best friend introduced me to bts  she s a passive fan and is more into k dramas  i tried introducing bts to a couple of other casual friends  a girl and a guy  but they already had this pre conceived idea that their fans are psycho because of the burn the stage chaos  so their judgemental reactions to the boys  my taste in music and guys mostly angered me and it s safe to say we don t hangout anymore  since then  i feel it s better to be not too vocal about it as most people here would react that way ,0,875,171
lol same ,0,9,2
my friends and coworkers know that i m a huge fan of bts  however  i try to limit how much i say about them just so that it doesn t get too annoying  i ll mention big highlights like their bts stadium tour  mattel dolls  the downey incident  snl  etc    most of them are pretty cool about it  but they clearly don t love bts as much as me  haha  i also have a bts mug at work  and i have a couple small bts posters in my cube that people can t see unless they are sitting at my desk  i also have office friendly bts desktop wallpapers  so i m pretty open about it  but for sure  my office too big for me to feel comfortable to do what you did for the birthday questionnaire  haha but go you  that s awesome and army approved    ,0,728,141
i wear it with pride  its all i post about on my stories on ig and ive lost about 3k followers cause of it  most of my followers follow me cause my boyfriend is a pro bmxer and they wanna lurk his life  and i could care less about that or internet followers but its funny everytime i have a heavy bts post day they all leave haha  so many of my irl friends support my army status  they will send me anything about bts   a couple of them filmed every time they were seen at the grammys to send it to me  i dont really care what anyone thinks i love those 7 chaotic dorks  ,0,571,116
i wouldn t say i flaunt it  but i definitely don t keep it a secret  i wear merch related to them and i m always happy to talk about them and explain who bts is to people who ask  but i don t really go out of my way aside from that to let people know i like bts ,0,262,56

not sure that info is correct  i was there at o2 and saw 2 seperate lines for light bombs  one for pre order collections and one normal line  i think o2 twitter even responded to tweeters that it was available for them to do so  i m just wondering if wembley will do the same if it s a common feature for most bts concerts ,0,323,61

i m the opposite of you  i absolutely love pink anything and everything  and i like the album packaging a lot  from a marketing perspective  however  they are an international group  making a push in the u s  and are already stereotyped as being just for girls  that s just how we perceive boybands  and with the added cultural different of kpop using androgynous clothing and makeup  it s magnified  i m sure their album will continue to draw in new fans  but it won t do anything to break that stereotype  even though they themselves are breaking it ,0,552,93

who is first ,0,13,3
i do wish they d gone with a different design  but i do love the bold insistence of the pink  it ll stand out for sure and it reminds me a bit of hyyh pt 1  i wonder if they worked with the same person in charge of packaging as ly  they seem more invested with details and the message than they are with doing something super new with packaging ,0,345,67

it s kinda opposite of me   i really like v2 s laundry room  amp  getting ready aesthetic ,0,90,16
since dna every comeback was a rollercoaster    no offense to bighit and their work but this sort of concept is overused and seems to be lazy  since the concept is  map of the soul   persona i thought they would utilize different camera angles and mirrors to showcase each members different personas  for example lets imagine a concept photo with rm  he is standing in the middle of a room full of mirrors and wears typical idol flashy clothes  but he is surrounded by 20 different mirror reflections and each reflection shows a bit of his persona  lets say one reflection shows namjoon as a hardcore rapper  the other one shows a vulnerable namjoon who is trying to find himself  the other is a proud leader of bts  sort of this concept would be fitting in my opinion but basic pictures in a house without my decoration and a dreamlike ly her filter is not what i would expect from a 2times bb200 topper     but armys would probably hate on my opinion and praise bts regardless while over interpreting the symbolism,0,1016,183
i just saw the version 4 photos and i m not quite sure what i think yet  they re beautiful but very eerie  they look posed and almost empty  even while they re about to consume fruit  not sure if it could serve a commentary on internal vs  external identity  or the implications of having an  image  ,0,300,54
i saw on twitter that hmv is also selling the album  i don t know if you can choose the versions online  but maybe they ll have them in their physical stores ,0,158,30

in terms of today s concept photos  i ll repost what i wrote here   gt i m wondering what the aesthetics could mean thematically  being at home and being yourself without pretense  being comfortable with yourself   gt   gt anyways  i m loving the difference between these jammies and those naughty bst ones  whereas the bst pajamas were silken  expensive looking and represented sensuality and excess  these persona concept ones are just comfy  i love it  the other concept photos seem to have to do with simultaneously recognizing and reconciling different  images   see  versions  of ourselves so that we can know ourselves well  that s what i took from the different cameras  visual depictions of happiness  the film stills of the group and each member  etc  that s my best guess at the moment  musically  i think they ll incorporate a lot of their past genre concepts  getting to know the different facets of the group  how all these different sides are good  important  and equally a part of them  could serve as a reflection of how we should get to know each of ourselves  for instance  don t throw away the past  but treasure and learn from it  this includes the mistakes and the missteps  each moment was intrinsic in making you who you are now  yet it doesn t wholly define or limit you because your present and your future and who you will become in those moments are equally intrinsic to your identity  i think that kind of concept  while of course psychologically interesting  can help a lot of people reach a place of peace with themselves  and  as a lot of people have said  i would love heavier hip hop elements  as well as the subtle rock elements we got from skool luv affair and dark  amp  wild  i also think we ll get a lot of contrasts  both musically  thematically  and aesthetically  it ll be artistically fun for them to do so  but it will also be a good callback to the concept  we as people are complex and multi faceted  made up of seeming contrasts   i m just really excited  guys ,0,2008,340

i always forget that bts had both 2nd and 3rd place for best selling album and then i get shook all over again  not even just getting on this chart but being so close to the top is such an accomplishment  on a side note  that s what i love about you  my fellow army s  actively supporting their actual music through streaming and purchases  i fear that through all the bts hype people  esp non fans  might forget the actual art they make  but this shows the fans love for the music in such a tangible way and it warms my heart  bts just naturally inspires so much support with their talent and by being themselves  anyway  glad to be here with all you fine people ,0,664,122

i agree to a certain extent  it s not even about these photos per se  just that for a group with a clear overarching theme and concepts that they ve literally built a fictional world around  i ve always been a little surprised when they surface sweep an idea rather than committing to it  it happens more often than one would think and it confuses me more than it bothers me because they are so committed to the big picture concepts and applying that same ideal to the smaller things is just as easy as not,0,506,93
funny how broke bighit in 2015 and early 2016 had better executed concept photos  hello hyyh  but now billion dollar company has only this to offer   basic boring pictures with the same colors like ly   her   i hope the mv wont be stupid green screen colorful but outdoor ,0,272,51

answer wasn t even slightly similar though   there are thematic ties but that s pretty much it  visually they have almost nothing in common  in fact these pics expand on that theme in quite a satisfying way in my opinion  answer versions s and e may have been visually more interesting  but i think these pics actually have more to say between the lines than those did  with that it was basically just  look cameras and eyes you get it people are watching us  look we re marionettes and in bubbles get it we re isolated and controlled by others   the execution is better  i agree  but when you think about it its also pretty literal and not that deep  and don t forget that those set of concept pics had some of the worst duds of the bunch  versions l and f are just phoned in pics of them in uniforms  these pics make me think a lot more and i think also a lot more consistent  i like them all  the pics here are much more simple but personally they resonate with me much more on an emotional level  like  them getting ready and putting on their earrings and doing their hair is super evocative of what all of us do every morning to put on our  personas   that set of pics in particular is relatable and emotional in a way ive never seen from them before  i also think that bts are pushing boundaries here  and even if they didn t they don t need to  these pics are     well to put in bluntly     really gay  and really feminine  i get that people want them to like    crossdress and go all out if they re gonna do that  but that wouldn t fit the theme  campy and big would have been cool but it also would have been a poor interpretation of what they re trying to say  again  just them getting ready in morning gets across that core idea better than an elaborate set and costumes ever could  i also actually don t think that bts has ever been about pushing boundaries  their goal is to express themselves and make what they want to make  and often coincidentally they end up pushing boundaries in service of that  ,0,2016,366

 gt  \ i just read some comments from the concept pics thread and i m overwhelmed by how people aren t seeing how concept 3 is a dollhouse  like holy moly zoomed the heck in f you need to buy look at how they are placed like dolls  those head angles  the clothes  the freaking room they re in       gt   gt it s not lazy  it s actually chilling  v1 2 have us practically spying on them going out  3 has them in the dollhouse and 4 has them put up on pedestals as modern day gods     this whole dollhouse concept kinda reminds me of fake love  i know the song is more geared toward a romantic interest  but almost seems to fit with people trying to control them  tell them what to do what not to do  etc   gt  for you i could pretend like i was happy when i was sad  for you i could pretend like i was strong when i was hurt    gt   gt  love you so bad  love you so bad  mold a pretty lie for you  love it s so mad  love it s so mad  try to erase myself and make me your doll   maybe they are moving beyond relationships and are going to speak more on society as a whole  like not just on how to love yourself  but actual criticism  just a thought   gt  the strawberry difference for 2seok from the rest of the group who s holding up grapes is intriguing  i mentioned a theory in my other post on the concept photo thread about this but not sure if you ve seen it  i ll post it again here    so in regard to the strawberries and grapes in the 4th concept photos  there s this quote by paracelsus which was in the introduction to the book  the art of loving  available on bighit s website     gt    he who knows nothing  loves nothing  he who can do nothing understands nothing  he who understands nothing is worthless  but he who understands also loves  notices  sees   the more knowledge is inherent in a thing  the greater the love   anyone who imagines that all fruits ripen at the same time as the strawberries knows nothing about grapes     maybe bighit just threw it in there to mess with us  but maybe it means something deeper    2seok subunit     gt  the album covers seem to be tying into ly  we ve moved on from that era and this era is connected but is also supposed to be new  so i don t know why they went so similar  i noticed that as well  like i mentioned  they seem to be expanding on how people view them and how they view themselves  in a way  all the albums connect in the sense that they are detailing the journey through adolescence into adulthood  i m guessing that this new album will refer back to their previous eras  we already got that through the persona intro  in some way so i wouldn t be surprised if we got hip hop bangtan again  like you  i m hoping that it s not too close  sound wise  to the ly era since the album art seems to suggest that  guess we ll see what happens  ,0,2808,518

my problem is that bighit themselves are repeating looks  let s say back in hyyh era  that was truly new and different from what they d done before  everything has been slightly different up until now  from number of versions to album shape  this is basically a complete repeat of ly era  down to the album design  you could put these pictures next to pictures from ly her or answer and they wouldn t look out of place   gt i ve never seen a group do this kind of  ken doll in a box  aesthetic they re doing in version 3  for example  they did something similar already for answer  and executed it better  gt from a purely artistic perspective these pics are fascinating  the pastel aesthetic and set design  how two dimensional and dollhouse like everything feels    creativity is bursting from the seams here  i agree  the problem i have is with the execution  there s so much unfulfilled potential in all of these pictures imo  i like minimalism done well   and again  bighit s done that better in the past  anyway you like these photos  i don t and we have a difference of opinion  but i think ultimately we both want the same things  which is for bts to keep pushing boundaries whether fans like it or not  i think that s what i got from your op ,0,1251,220

ok  so what  in your eyes  was bts and bighit doing right before as opposed to  nowadays   what s changed  because in my eyes  production value and creativity have only gone up  did you have these same issues with bst and spring day comeback pics  by your metrics  one of those was just them looking sultry in various dark sets and another was just them covered in paint  not exactly  original   bst concept pics are my favorites they ve ever done but they aren t exactly boundary pushing or special either  it s pretty basic  dark and gothic  stuff  again  i think you re limiting yourself by looking at surface level details  you can draw a line between almost anything if  holding a flower  is your standard for things being derivative  i ve never seen a group do this kind of  ken doll in a box  aesthetic they re doing in version 3  for example  especially a boy group  it s boundary pushing precisely because it comes off as plastic and shallow  that s the point  it s the same thing i loves about version s of answer  it s saying  don t like it  feel uncomfy  think about why that is   from a purely artistic perspective these pics are fascinating  the pastel aesthetic and set design  how two dimensional and dollhouse like everything feels    creativity is bursting from the seams here  minimalism doesn t equal bad  often the most cluttered  high concept stuff is the most unoriginal  imo  and again  sorry to keep harping on and continuing this line of text  but i truly think that no one would be saying anything if these pics were traditionally masculine  everyone shit themselves over tear pics because they were masculine even if they were the most boring  its perceived as shallow because feminity is infantalized and treated as lesser   it s just pandering and appealing to fangirls  if it s this but not when they re wearing black and bondage gear  why  ,0,1872,314

love yourself  persona is coming lol,0,36,6
i think the map of the soul series will show just how accepting    bts has become of their role as idols artists influencers along with staying to their true selves  it really will be the culmination and step forward of the love yourself series  since it s most likely going to be a series  persona might talk about them accepting their idol selves  like what rm raps about in the comeback trailer  how he is all the personas that he and everyone else makes of him  and how he has come to accept that it is part of who he is  i m assuming the other 2 albums will focus more on the other layers in the theory  the concept photos might not really suit the hip hop vibe of the trailer but it does suit the persona album theme  if you look at all versions of the photos  they re very bright  colorful  and gaudy  much like what you do when you put on a mask persona  you make yourself look happy and unbothered  granted this doesn t mean they are faking the smiles  i just think the concept photos are showing off their idol side more than anything else  i would love to have hip hop take a forefront in this album mostly because it s been so long since their last big hip hop album  but also  add a couple pop or vocal focused song for the vocal line as well  i think bts does pretty good in allowing all their members and their unique styles to shine so whatever is released i will accept with much love     ,0,1406,263

as much as that sounds amazing  i don t think bts is looking to make hit songs so much as they want to get a message out to the public  even rm said in their ew interview about it   gt   a hot 100 and a grammy nomination  these are our goals    but they re just goals    we don t want to change our identity or our genuineness to get the number one  like if we sing suddenly in full english  and change all these other things  then that s not bts  we ll do everything  we ll try    but if we couldn t get number one or number five  that s okay     on another note  an independent album between series would have been nice and refreshing but even d amp w and wings were basically prologues to the following series    ,0,716,131

well i think a lot of people are reaching anyway to pull these into the persona theme when they ve done this kind of stuff a million times  i ve seen joon hold a flower to his face in that exact same way at least 5 times  one was for ly her concept   and the greek god theme is obviously part of what they re going for but they didn t commit past having the members eat fruit and lounge around on a light colored set  i m sure someone could connect the boys wearing dramatic dresses somehow  putting on an elaborate costume   persona  if we re going to applaud them wearing slightly elaborate jewelry and more effeminate clothes  then why not go all in  but overall  that s my biggest problem with bighit these days  they never seem to fully delve deep into anything for concepts  they skim the surface while still giving fanservice as their highest priority  that s what i think a lot of fans  problems with the more effeminate styling is   at least that s my problem  i think it s fanservice to appeal to younger fans or fans who want the members to look  pretty  as opposed to being really daring and trying to say something  i love when bts is daring and pushes the envelope  but these days the only really daring part is in their music not in their image ,0,1260,228

yes yes yes to that last part    i ve been spending a lot of time thinking about what the natural progression is after loving yourself  what do we need to learn after we learn how to love ourselves  a lot of people say that you can begin to love others  but what happens if you keep it introspective  i ve been stuck on that for a while  the idea of which self is great  i really hope that is the direction they re going in  i have a lot of faith in their message and the direction bts has taken over the years so i m not really worried  ,0,538,105
but the concept is  persona  or how they are perceived  would a big elaborate elizabethan concept really match that  and i personally don t think bts has done this before  at least not like this  they haven t ever leaned into this dollhouse  pastel wes anderson look  they ve used stuff like flowers before but those are just surface level props  everything is derivative if you look at just that stuff  i also struggle to see people comparing these negatively to the tear concept pics  like     one version of that was just them in denim in a white room and two others were just them in school uniforms  i don t think those were bad either  but if you had to call something lazy and derivative    those would definitely be it  these are spectacular in comparison  imo  all i m saying is that people wouldn t be talking about this if they were masculine concepts  if they were styled like the we re in tear  even if it was almost identical  people would still be raving about it  it s only a problem if it s feminine  ,0,1018,176

i ve looked at the 4 concepts  and maybe i m just an over thinker at this point  but i thought all 4 versions had stories to tell  version 1 is selfie mania  vanity ego  selfies  imo  are egotistical   everyone wants to look good in a selfie  everyone tries different faces when taking a selfie  i m guilty of the same lol version 2 is bts being goofy with their friends  getting ready for an event  everyone putting on earrings or styling their hair  it s very  look at me   version 3 is like barbie world  everything is bright  simple  soft  no sharp edges  everyone is cute and shy and romantic  this version is the most idol like of all  version 4 is darker  more grown up  sensual  the colours are sharper  louder  less in sync with all the different patterns on the sweaters  the hot pink pants and loafers  the big costume jewelry etc  it s very flashy   almost bordering on tacky  but it s also showing them lounging about with an idaf vibe  it s very indulgent  from the outfits to the fruits  to the bedroom eyes  all 4 versions show different facets of bts   of every person  really  we all have  faces  we show to the world  not necessarily pretending  but most people always want to show their best side  sometimes according to the people they are with  we don t show the same face when with co workers vs  with friends  it s the same with bts  there s been many discussions about how we don t truly know them beyond what they show us  and we don t have the right to know  tbh  but what if these photos are them showing us they can be vain and superficial  that they can be like many 20 somethings who like to party and look good all the time  that they can also be romantic and dreamy and sweet  and that they can seduce you with just one look  we ve watched them grow over the years  but this is the first time i ve felt they re truly owning the concept  the photos may be too simple for some  but to me  there is so much more to analyze and look at since ly era when bts started sharing their journey to loving themselves  the question  who the hell am i   is all over these photos  i think it s the true concept  you can learn to love yourself  but which self  can you love all of you  ,0,2203,398
i understand where you re coming from but i don t completely agree  i don t mind high style and taking stylistic risks in any form but unfortunately that s not what bighit is doing here imo  i do consider these safe and boring bc bighit has done all these before  i ve seen them pose in gucci and with flowers on flat sets many times before  i think the amount of stuff they could do is endless  imagine them going full young thug in elizabethan dresses or something  or going full camp into the greek god theme with robes and sumptuous sets  now  that would be really pushing boundaries and doing something truly interesting,0,625,109

that s so cool ,0,15,3
i forget the exact website there s a site where you can create your own eyeshadow palette as well as customize the packaging  i ve seen a few people on twitter design some based on a bunch of different bts albums ,0,213,39
tbh i think the whole point of that track is reciprocation to aoki for mic drop  there s no actual push for it from both sides  the mv is as low cost as  american girl  ,0,169,34
haha who would ve thought during that era though that the fandom will be thirsting for more solo songs in the future  i still remember how hobi fucking owned that era  this is just a phase  like everything else ,0,211,38
lol i agree 100   i just mean that i question the root of why people have such a problem with this stuff and insist on associating femininity with shallowness  all these spicy hot takes about how bad these concept pics are bad like they might be the  tiniest  bit based in mysoginy  everyone talking about how they were expecting a  darker and deeper  concept  as if these concept pics aren t evoking dollhouse and greek god imagery that matches the concept of  persona  perfectly  when what they actually mean is  masculine   you can dislike the pics all you like  i m not here to police that    but if your big issue is  too much pink and jewelry why aren t they wearing black and looking brooding  maybe     think about why you think that ,0,742,129
the boys look divine  as per usual  so don t get me wrong    but i m a bit underwhelmed  all four options look kind of similar to me    i have a feeling that previously the versions were different while keeping up with the same symbolism  now  the concept photos are pretty much identical  maybe that s the point  i don t even know  ,0,333,60
thanks for reminding me that  i have already thought of a hiphop sound this era ever since persona trailer was released  and these photos don t scream hiphop at all  ,0,166,29
i also think it s in the order it is because the personas tell the celebrity story  version 1  before celebrity  normal people selfies  hair doesn t look styled beyond the color  not posed version 2  learning to put on the idol persona  posing  getting ready  everyone is looking in different directions in the group photo version 3  stereotypical idolhood  cute  corny manufactured boyfriend photos  not too stylized version 4  celebrity  stylized group photo  obvious posing  showing luxury brands gt cohesive outfits,0,519,78
ugh yoongi s voice makes me so weak i listen to his album reviews all the time ,0,79,16
i agree to this  kinda find the difference of the mood of these concept photos vs  the mood of the persona trailer a bit funny tho  the latter is more fitting for the bts persona imo  hope to hear more like that in this album ,0,226,45
yeah i think its best not to assume too much from the concept photos anyway  the concept photos and the actual music may have little direction connection  ,0,155,27

hobi s pink pants and loafers are the best styling in these pictures ,0,69,12
yesss the only merch that i knew i had to get no matter what was the ring but i couldn t get it last time  ,0,107,25
thanks  in my opinion  given all the elements of the photo  especially the cramped  peaked ceiling  this is what made the most sense to me ,0,139,25
xd this was so cute had to share  the boys were changing between   or    when it returned to normal lol,0,103,22
i agree  the shoot communicates empty decadence  boredom  knowledge of good and evil  corruption   and over indulgence  at least  that s my take  i agree with everyone referencing ancient rome or greece  the large shroud they sit on in the group photo and the grapevines  along with everything else we ve discussed  seem quite direct to me ,0,340,54
yeah the version 2 or even version 1 3 would have been so much better  really questionable decisions  ,0,102,17
i admit not really a fan of these  i mean i like pink but it just doesn t look that appealing here  that heart looks pretty bleh too  at least the concept photos are nice    ,0,174,35
yeah like i think i m set on version 2  but namjoon in version 4 is almost powerful enough to make me change my mind  ,0,118,24
i honestly hoped for another independent album like dark  amp  wild or wings  i feel like these huge multi album concepts are just limiting their creative freedom and possibilities  with how many western artists want collabs  couldn t they just make an independent album where they just try to make as many hits as possible with international collabs like zedd  shawn mendes  etc  and just go full mainstream  i wonder how this persona era will be  and if it will finally maybe also answer questions from the bu  if they still plan on answering the questions from here  because at this point it seems more complicated than the plot of game of thrones   all i really care about at this point is if they make good songs that actually have hit potential  ,0,752,130
i mean   considering nobody uses vpn tricks to get high on canadian charts and the fact that canadian charts are very similar to us charts kind of prove that the us charts are organically us driven ,0,198,36
i agree in terms of jin s likely having old fashioned values in some ways  he s shown chivalry in several instances  mentions his mom  continued his higher education like a good son  and is not as expressive with his inner thoughts and emotions as other members or young people  or rather  those he chooses to display are the more  positive  ones  he s also been referred to as  manners idol  by the korean public for some time  as well as  nation s son in law   his clothing choices  like the simple thom browne ensembles  also indicate a more structured  old fashioned values system  though he does leave on price tags to be hip hop   my point is that his style of dress is more reserved than someone like tae  hobi  or jimin  and he genuinely felt shy when he was made to wear a top with a sheer insert across his upper chest  i obviously don t know jin personally  and since he s a bit more reserved  that also can make him harder to figure out  so i may be way off base  but like you  i have also felt like jin is a little more traditional and not as open as many members of the younger generation ,0,1103,198
honestly  4 is probably the most foreshadowing of shadow of the sets  they have it all  they put on this facade of rich kings  but a lot of ugly is simmering behind the empty eyes  i don t know if we ll be ready for that ,0,221,44
even with answer  no one really knew what the album will try to tell us after the concept photos were out  ,0,107,21
i think it s interesting that a lot of fans  myself included  feel that we ll get a hip hop heavy album  while the concept photos and album art would imply otherwise  i m really interested to see if they plan to contrast the look of the album with the content  or if we are totally off base about bts  going back to their roots   either way  i m sure it ll be great  ,0,367,69
really interesting observation  i didn t think of a dollhouse but now that you point it out i can totally see it ,0,113,21
totally agree  especially the part about feeling kinda bad about not liking them lol  at the end of the day their concept photos are pretty divorced from the music itself  which im still super excited for   ,0,207,36
but the funny thing is that bubblegum kpop is only done by younger kpop groups like txt  if this album is supposed to tackle persona  i guess it could fit  but the concepts and themes have become so vague  and the bu is also so convoluted at this point that i wish they would just try to make music that is as good as possible and will give them as much success as possible instead of sticking to these concepts  ,0,413,80
remember when people were hating the idea of solos in wings lmfao ,0,66,12
yeah actually i wouldn t be surprised at all if it was their first comeback  bts are gaining fans all the time anyway  ,0,119,22
try downloading them instead  i almost always do that because my internet is bad enough that vlive videos rarely work well ,0,123,21
they re kinda aesthetically pleasing but overall lacked impact    i feel bad for not liking them but it s just not up my alley   amp  x200b ,0,140,23
 gt  certain people complained from that it sounded nothing like the teaser uhh what  is this their first bts comeback lmao  did they think bts  new single would be a medieval church song  ,0,189,33
ok gotcha     i apologise if the last sentence was a bit rude,0,61,12
answer was a light pink until they revealed the cover  so it was a fair assumption haha,0,87,17
yeah  i usually don t mind pink   but it s a bit overwhelming  haha  ,0,69,11
that picket is flipping adorable but i have terrible luck  as in zero luck  getting the random bonuses  \_ ,0,107,19

 gt  yellow brassy blonde that gives me flashbacks to jin in idol    ugh that hair looked so bad  when you look at other older kpop groups  they seem to mainly have black dark brown hair with only a 1 or 2 members with dyed hair  don t know why bts suddenly has this very boyish debut group styling when they re literally all well into adulthood  [examples]   [of similarily]   [old kpop groups]  ,0,397,69

well i dont think you can pick a version on amazon but if there s a store near you that is going to sell the albums you could always pick the ver1 and it should have all the extra stuff  possibly not the poster though because its only with preorder unless the store did get it preordered   also i think there s other kpop sites that let you choose the versions but idk the sites bc i always get it from amazon ,0,410,80

strawberries on the other hand     they are associated to a greek goddess  venus aphrodite due to its red color and shape like a heart  it is believed to be an aphrodisiac  with the greek writer ovid  citing its sweetness akin to erotic pleasure  but in some folklore  they are associated to healing  and leading to salvation  a fruit that comes straight from the earth  a gift from mother earth or something to that sort ,0,422,73
i agree  this kinda reminds me of the bubblegum world of kpop and i think that s why they stuck to this  it s very idol ish   amp  x200b  100  agree with the tear concept i still can t get over version o hobi hehe,0,213,40
with the pink hearts on the album and the valentine s day type of photoshoot  i m yet to get hyped for this comeback  i d like a good diversion though ,0,151,28
right  they don t look happy in any of the photos  they even look bored in the group shot ,0,90,18
yeah  like there s something sensual  yes  but also vaguely threatening  the type of luxury that would lead to overindulgence or indolence  maybe   ,0,148,22
thank you  that s really nice to hear   ,0,40,8
hahaha i totally know what you mean  that houndstooth pattern on the scarf is something that i normally hate  but on tae  it looks so appealing  and the bold colors just jump out at you and make such a strong statement      he s too beautiful for this world  ,0,259,46
i go for peaches and cream    namjoon said it s sweeter than sweet before loljk ofc bangtan    yeahhhhh,0,103,18
i love all four pink colors  if they could make lipstick colors or blushes i d buy that too lol ah i m so excited for the notes  i hope it ll be possible to understand them even without having read the book,0,206,40
even if they didnt look similar it just bothers me whenever their concept pictures feel vapid  no there doesnt have to be some deep dark meaning  but having concept images that are concept images that relate in some way to the actual concept would be appreciated lmao  and it makes it more frustrating that frankly it is no difficult to come up with something at least a little more creative than standing in a room with a rose and awkwardly smiling  i remember back during wings era namjoon was in a room with broken busts and heaps of mirrors  that fits in better with the ideas of identity and persona than these do to me,0,624,115

not feeling these  i prefer versions 1 and 2        don t mean to be a debbie downer but like   can t they think of anything more interesting than posing with a fruit   the fruits very well may symbolize something knowing bighit but like    they can do something else    ,0,271,46
its so pretty  i really love the effect you gave his hair and jacket  the texturing is amazing ,0,95,18

i kind of hate v s outfit  but he s soooo photogenic  it kinda makes me think the outfit looks really good i am having very conflicting emotions,0,144,26
seems to me bh really got gucci as the brand to tie in to the many many symbolisms into their concepts   i mean the greek god dionysus  the clothes that is almost fluid in gender and gucci is all about that    then the bees  the pearls    and now grapes  strawberries  and a lot of color palette that is soft and spring    bh already got that big budget to really lather them in jewels and all that finery threads ,0,414,76
sadly i agree with this  this design feels a bit lazy and like you said a cheap knock off  ,0,91,19
i am thoroughly enjoying reading everyone s theories in this post but i personally don t see shit either  dense as fuck i guess  ,0,129,22
i agree  they kind look similar  tbh  there s no  standout  this time around  i was thinking these are just different ways to tell the persona of being an idol  beautiful  flawless  colorful  like    they re not supposed to make you think deeply  they just need to be aesthetically pleasing     idk i m not making sense   amp  x200b  i ll get version 1  i like that there s a lot of photos there lol,0,399,67

i wasn t arguing with you  i was just adding on to your comment  ,0,65,13
what do you guys think the album will talk about   since all the concept photos are out i can t tell what exactly they are telling us  i just hope this album is not as heavy as the ly series ,0,191,40

i mean i like pink  so that s good    but the packaging just makes me feel like we never left ly era  as of the contents of the album  i wouldn t worry   bts have kinda outgrown hip hop stereotypes of associating only certain styles with the music  the aesthetic can be fancy as can be and rapline will still spit fire ,0,319,60

through these concept photos i have come to the realization how well rm would fit a sexy concept like    dude was made for it ,0,126,24
well  it s normal lol we have different tastes  i personally don t like the pink peach hues and too much pastel colors on these concept photos but you bet i loved to death when they were all clad in denim in the r version and how they were styled in the o version of tear album but yeah still personally disappointed about not having a  dark concept  for the last two versions   ,0,379,71
it feels almost like a grid city layout  but it s not a strict grid so i couldn t be sure  i think the labels for the dots say  map of the soul  and stuff  so it might just be a style choice ,0,191,41

  version 3      tae gives me the genie in the bottle vibes in their group photo   yoongi looks like a prince that s been sheltered his whole life and i love his purple robe   jimin looks like a fairy in his solo pictures  if his pants were a little shorter he d look like peter pan  the outfit really fits his frame well  i like that the shirt is translucent  or appears to be in my eyes   his solo pics are wonderful  i think he somehow looks a bit feminine with the way he poses on the left pic but the close up shot of him feels very masculine   are 95 line wearing shirts from the same designer  they look pretty similar in style    version 4      tae is so incredibly photogenic  his pic reminds me of those big self portraits monarchs used to have that are displayed in museums  i simultaenously hate his outfit and think he looks out of this world only because he s so damn photogenic    oh boy  rm this comeback will be the end of me  based on these concept photos i don t think i will be capable of handling the platinum blonde hair   forehead  it s just too much  somebody needs to tell him to chill    jimin looks like he s about to inhale that cluster of grapes in one breath   ,0,1191,222

my first thought was that they resemble mapped out stars that are part of a constellation ,0,90,16
i really want v1  partly aka very largely influenced by my bias eating cookies  but preorders  amazon  with preorder goodies extras  are random  is there a way i can get the v1 and the goodies extras  or do i just have to pick one over the other ,0,246,45
it s sooo beautiful           ,0,30,4
i love version 1 because there s just soooooooooo many photos of them in there lol,0,82,15
so i was doing some brief research on the theory of personality from carl jung and how it ties in to these photo concepts album theme and i think i sort of understand  so the first theory is self and deals with our own identity  2nd concept   which is represented through each member looking at themselves in the mirror introspectively  second is persona  which is the phony self that we show to others public  1st concept   which is shown through camera selfies and premeditated poses  third is anima  which is defined by the feminine side of men  the 3rd concept pics show that side using the roses  and it also looks like they re in a bedroom so maybe it can also mean intimacy  fourth is shadow  which portrays the cruel side of us containing animalistic urges and feelings of inferiority  the 4th concept pictures literally shows their shadow reflecting against the walls and they re seen eating fruit  forbidden fruit representing the urges    this is just my wild guess ,0,977,166
only  bts   well and bighit too but u get what i mean  will tell what bts will do with their new stuff  haha  ,0,110,23
  theory    so in regard to the strawberries and grapes in the 4th concept photos  there s this quote by paracelsus which was in the introduction to the book  the art of loving  available on bighit s website   gt  he who knows nothing  loves nothing  he who can do nothing understands nothing  he who understands nothing is worthless  but he who understands also loves  notices  sees   the more knowledge is inherent in a thing  the greater the love   anyone who imagines that all fruits ripen at the same time as the strawberries knows nothing about grapes   maybe this gives the photos more meaning  idk  on a side note  [here s shitty watercolor s take on it]  ,0,664,111
namjoon in version 4 what the fuck        amp  x200b  tbh  i was expecting an edgier  kind of punk look for the last two versions  similar to namjoon s styling on persona  but oh well that will probably look weird on a barbie pink colored album     i d probably order the first version  since yoongi looks so so so pretty there and i loved the filmstrip concept ,0,362,62
does anyone know the best way to get all 4 versions in london  i know that amazon are selling the albums  but i doubt i d end up with 4 different versions just buy buying 4 albums off amazon  i d love to take part in the pre order  so any help would be much appreciated      ,0,275,54

this  no cringe fests  they could still use a fresh hairstylist  really    the same 3 cuts again   but overall it s yummy ,0,122,21
i wish they would use that group photo as their header and maybe the version 2 group pic as their profile picture  this picture is nice but you can t really appreciate it ,0,171,32

in ver 4  jin is wearing a paramount studios sweater in the group photo  i wonder if this references both his acting aspirations and the idea mentioned here  celebrity  which would also be consistent with what i had mentioned earlier for ver 2  old hollywood and the darker side of the fame industry  ,0,301,53
omg im really digging version 1 and 3    and my god the notes we going full circle again baby ,0,94,19

lowkey wish they used the version 2 group photo  but i understand that it may be too much for the gp to handle  gotta start them off soft i suppose ,0,148,30

really interesting  jungkook is wearing a gucci purse literally called  dionysus   it can t be casual,0,101,15
well not everyone is going to love every concept they have  and we come to reddit to discuss different opinions and views  if people find this simple  maybe they want to discuss that with other people  simple doesn t automatically mean it s a complaint  it s an observation  i think you re being unfair to open discussion ,0,322,54
i was surprised there wasn t a shoot with an outdoor element or a slightly larger  scale  than what the 4 versions provide  they do feel sort of claustrophobic in their scale  amp  simplicity  i m still not sure whether that was intentional to the concept or if i m analyzing too much  ,0,286,50
well i think she s pointing it out in case others who are a bit newer to the fandom don t realise that the whole complaining thing is a norm by now and then start to freak out thinking that that fans are hating everything,0,221,43

do version 3  amp  4 make anyone else feel a little uncomfortable  i feel like there s something about the juxtaposition of the staging  poses   amp  colors that gives me this sense of dissonance  it s haunting in away that i think art should be  i m curious how any of this will translate into the actual sound of the album  ,0,326,58
if you are in the us  the official bighit store has options to pre order specific versions   ,0,93,16
aw man  the ly series made my album design standards too high  not really feeling the all out pink  and that s saying  something  because my favorite color is pink   but i can understand that it s kind of hard to top a grammy nominated album design  i know a lot of thought went into the design and i don t want to devalue their hard work  but i was hoping they d do something different ,0,387,72

i like how they go back and forth  nothing like the roller coaster of getting eyes and hands embedded in walls and fairies trapped in globes one comeback and then selfies and empty rooms the next,0,195,36
i thought the same  but maybe it s supposed to be sort of forced and artificial  like a  persona  that they are presenting us  that being said  sometimes the previous album concept photos had nothing to do with the album music content so i feel like they could have been a little more creative for a couple of these ,0,316,57
yeaaaah i m lined up for three but now i m like  welp gonna need at least 2 as well   i m in so much trouble  ,0,110,23

 gt  version 4  the hedonistic persona expected of the famous    i defintiely get greek gods vibes from this one  the group photo looks as if they are lounging on marble and the grapes make me think of dionysus  this is what kfans are theorizing too  just to add to this dionysus is the god of grape cultivation and wine  among other things  and snakes are commonly associated with him cause in one of the origin stories  zeus gives him a crown of snakes after he was born again from zeus s thigh     also a bit more on the nose reference is that the bag around jungoo s neck is a dionysus gucci bag haha  ,0,606,113

the way i gasped ,0,17,4
biiiissssshhhhhhh        the symbolisms  most especially  the grape symbolism  grapes  in the greek mythos  symbolize wealth  power  victory  happiness  but there is also a connection to a god called dionysus  who is the god of wine  and funny enough a recurring motif in gucci  which is the band s brand of choice   dionysus is not just the god of wine  but of harvest  fertility  and madness  ecstacy and theater  or flambouyance   he is visually depicted as a god with man with womanly features  grapes   when taken with a human subject  symbolizes birth or rebirth  so does this mean they are giving rebirth to their true selves  or giving birth to a new era that we will have to explore ourselves into  also  dionysus is also called eleutherios  meaning  the liberator   because his wine  music  and ecstatic dance freed his believers from restraints from society  therefore reveling in their true selves  so my only  art history amateur  conclusion  is this new concept photos depicts freedom  revealing their true selves or living life authentically and happily  ugh  so much and that is on one fruit  what a doozy  this concept photos  i busted out my old a   art history book to get myself all acquainted with the greek mythos and gods goddess today  bh is bringin  out the greek geek in me  yas ,0,1305,215

you must have missed it then  it got overridden by the number of people who loved it  certain people complained from that it sounded nothing like the teaser to the hard  k  in the fake  people complain about everything  i tell you ,0,231,42
i didn t expect everything to be so    pink  like maybe that s just a persona  but this coupled with the soft ish concept photos suggests something more dreamy rather than hip hop bangers and rock  maybe it s meant to be a whiplash  hahaha ,0,240,41
for the first time ever i changed my reddit header to that photo  such a feast ,0,79,16

version 3 isn t really my cup of tea except for jimin because wow  but i guess i got lucky  i preordered version 2 and it ended up being my favorite ,0,149,30
i love how jimin stepped a bit away from the door to look taller  d the pastel aesthetic loos really nice  i m not a fan of version 4  the clothes are just hideous  but maybe we woudn t survive the boys in nice clothes while sensually eating fruits  ,0,250,47

it s guaranteed someone will always be unhappy with their photos  it happens every time  they can t please everyone  everyone has a style they prefer  if they like their more risky concepts  they will feel a bit underwhelmed by the simple ones  and the ones who prefer it simple might roll their eyes at the weird  dark and edgy concepts  but in the end  they are just photos and people will be buying the albums anyway  we will likely never look at these photos ever again until the album arrives and we open the photobook then close it again to store it away  so if someone says they don t like the photos  that s alright  we don t have to like everything  last time  version s and e got a lot of bad reactions from the korean side  didn t they  it s normal they go with simple instead this time ,0,798,146

hahah true though  every comeback you ll see a fraction of people complaining about everything my advice is just sit back and enjoy the ride  ,0,142,24
i feel like the concept photos for the ly series were very different from those of earlier eras  and it seems like big hit s continuing the trend of the ly style  it s like four distinct photoshoots with different styling props but an overarching aesthetics mood that ties it all together  i m excited to see how the packaging overall has changed  i really hope there s more distinct differences of the outside packaging of the four versions  like diff colors  like they did with earlier non wings ly albums  but overall  i m really digging these photos  can t really choose a favorite so far  they all look equally gorgeous and nobody has yet to have questionable hairstyle styling imo  i love how casual and personal everything is  ,0,734,119

i think it s a matter of scale  super bowl performances are much more of a make or break than any award show  americans can correct me if i m wrong but isn t it the most watched event of the year  and people expect to see their absolute favorites performing for the half time show  bts would be getting extremely harsh criticism from the moment they were announced  i just don t feel like the audience would appreciate them at all and tbh  it would hurt their popularity more than it would help because it d be a full week of memes and hating on social media  people love to hate what s popular to hate  non fans who might ve given them a chance could just go  nah  from that point on  not to mention the risk of performance issues   bad mic  back track issues  choreo mistakes from bg dancers  prop issues  someone s sick and doesn t sound good  someone s injured and can t dance perform  yadda yadda yadda  too much that could go wrong and idk  once again  i just don t think it s worth the risk this time  compare this to snl  which i think is a perfect opportunity for exposure ,0,1082,195

enfp here and i have no friends  associative or close  some days it s not bad but every so often i get hit with the reality of it and it hurts  i just wait it out until the next day  if he s serious  there may be quite a few factors at play here  1  he s an introvert  and  also shy  it s like a double whammy  makes it hard for him to put himself out there and meet new people  2  he seems more conservative than the others  i mean  i could be completely off base here but he seems more reserved in demeanor  like he was raised or chose at a young age to behave a certain way  more polite  doesn t make the wrong move  etc  he s got a strong sense of old fashioned values in him  a layer of etiquette that resides under the surface of his behavior  i believe this is one of the reasons why many fans  whether they know it or not  love him so much  he has this lovely mix of being silly and free and yet regal at the same time  however  these traits can make finding friends his age difficult as our generation doesn t tend to uphold those types of values  instead putting value on expression  independence  and pushing boundaries  it also makes it difficult to know what you  as a person  can of can t do  3  age  we have to remember that jin is 26  this isn t old by any means but many people our age are settling down and having kids  it s hard to meet other singles because we now have to factor in each others  work schedule  personal plans  and their our time with other relationships  for jin especially this has to make keeping in contact with any same age friends difficult as he might have the only free moment in a week but his friends are all busy  i m not sure how it is in sk but in the south  at least my side of it  it s pretty common for people my age to be married with kids or at least married  finding friends sometimes feels like finding a needle in a haystack  anyway  he may just be joking with us but if he s being serious then i ve listed why it could be  none of these things are bad  and i don t believe he should change anything about himself to please others  he s still very young  handsome  and above all  really sweet and a cool guy  he has plenty of time to meet people who he can connect with at a later time  jin  if you re reading this  you re fine  just keep being you  you are a bentley in a world of kias  everyone wants you  but very few have the bravery to test drive you  and only a select few can afford to keep you  you are a rare treasure in this world and not everyone is going to understand your worth  don t ruin yourself to look and be like everyone else  your creator designed you just as you should be  just keep being kim seokjin from gwacheon  accept your name and accept it s meaning  everything will work out for you  i promise   ,0,2785,528
native or fluent korean speakers  i m curious about how the boys come across in korean  obviously we all have a basic idea of their personalities  stuff like  namjoon is smart    taehyung is sometimes abstract    jimin is earnest    j hope s public persona is extra  etc  but i m wondering how they come across in korean  are they well spoken and intellectual  or more casual  do they speak like teenagers or articulate adults  or a combination of the above  [this]   where the various members discuss their personal impressions of taehyung got me especially curious  especially jungkook s response  he seems to really pause and consider his words and either isn t totally confident  or wants to be sure of what he s saying before he speaks  ,0,742,118

 i am like that myself  i am very social when required and have enough friends but hardly very many  best friends   the only best friend is a best friend because she always makes effort with me which encourages to make me effort  it s mainly because i am very outgoing and friendly when i am with people but i never feel the need to  talk to friends  when i am alone  i prefer to keep my problems to myself as well and rarely seek advise or feel the need to confide in people unless it s happened organically if we are catching up and the topic comes up  i feel jin might be similar  which is probably why i relate to him   he has time and again talked about how he doesn t talk about his problems or confides in his members  it also seems like other members such as jk jimin seek him out first to socialise such as having dinner in his roomotherwise he is happy doing his own thing  he also mentions in ly seoul dvd how other members confide in him since he is easy to talk to but he doesn t talk about his problems unless it s huge  but then once he is in a social setting he always seems to be having fun and enjoying himself  ,0,1130,217

did jin say he doesn t text much because he doesn t get many texts from friends  or that he doesn t have friends  if so  i wonder how much that actually bothers him  because if it did bother him  he could have easily avoided explaining this  i think he may be comfortable with his contact with his friends in bts every day  and i think he also talks to his mom regularly  we also know he reaches out to sleepy and others at certain times  but that he s also kind of quiet during interviews  so he may just not be a casually chatty person or extrovert who seeks out conversational contact unless there s a reason for it ,0,619,115

frankly  as long as it s not a cutesy  bubbly concept  not that there s anything wrong with that  it s just not my thing  nor do i think that s in the realm of this album   i ll be happy no matter what  i would definitely prefer some more old school stuff  not necessarily hip hop  though that d be cool  but less poppy  if that makes sense   have the rappers do old school hip hop  and the vocalists do stuff similar to got7 s  if you do   which to me gives off an 80 s vibe  the darker  not madonna side   i feel like that would mix with the old school hip hop well to have a variety of song types without straying from the central tone theme  i d prefer that at least a few songs aren t hip hop  so i think a mix would be good ,0,730,140

the super bowl question item has come up a few times and the arguments against them performing always seem to boil down to two points  1  this is an american event  so an american should perform with american music  2  super bowl fans are racist and would hate them and it would be horrible etc    my feeling is this   on point one  american identity has always been fluid  with the capability of individuals to continually question what indeed might make an american event american  likewise american music spans a wide expanse of sound  culture and audiences  bts s music has been played at sports events now for the past 2 years  they have performed at american awards shows and in us arenas and will now perform in stadiums  the music might sound different  but that s okay to because what exactly is american music supposed to sound like  point 2   when bts was first invited to the billboards and there was discussions of them performing  many people on this forum and twitter said they were glad bts would not be because of the hatred and racism in the us  these racist people exist but fear that they would destroy bts somehow did not happen  i don t think it would happen if they performed at the super bowl either  i don t see this come up in the super bowl discussions very often   but why do we as army fans feel that bts should limit themselves because people will say things  they have had horrible horrible things said to them already  and we can all see how strong they are  they also have immense support from the us television media  if bts became the subject of racist feedback after  any  show at this point  we as fans would just need to tweet some talkshow hosts  you know who  and it would be news  i didn t mean to throw this all on you  so sorry  it s just every time the super bowl comes up i think about this   amp  x200b ,0,1849,335

my biases are the three members of bts that consistently surprise me and that s jhope  jimin  and suga in no particular order  jhope s personality comes out here and there and i m still putting all the pieces together  he s serious  hard working  has bounds of energy  and just puts forth this cool vibe that goes deep into his bones  it s totally at odds with the variety show version of himself  i just want to know more about him and i can t look away from him whenever he s on stage  jimin i just refer to mentally as an angel  he s so lovely   lovely is the best word i can use to describe him  the way he moves  his face  and his personality are just so effortlessly sweet and captivating  i can never not notice jimin and that s so powerful  he was definitely born to be stared at on stage and he just glows in front of other people  did i mention he s literally beautiful inside and out  and then suga    where to even begin  he s one of those people that when they talk you shut up and listen  nothing frivolous ever comes out his mouth  he s insightful  brilliant  and deeply compassionate and it comes across in his work  i identify the most with him because i m a pretty reflectively person  i love expressing my opinions and have a nack for seeing the bigger picture  suga appearance is oddly porcelain doll like  which is a direct contradiction to his rapper from daegu persona  his face and body is thin like a cat and he s very pretty yet so imposing  he s just great and he conveys his thoughts clearly and effectively every time  i really do find him fascinating  so yeah i don t think i could choose between these three   they all tie for my number  1 bias spot  number two would be jin and namjoon and number three would be jungkook and v  not that i don t utterly adore every single one of them  but jimin  jhope and suga just make me feel some type of way when i see them or hear them talk  ,0,1913,354

it did well the first week of release just because army s streamed it  but after a few days i think most army realized that it just wasn t it and stopped streaming  then afterwards aoki also posted a super cringey music video that basically killed any hopes of becoming a hit  i don t have any sources  but i just cannot see anybody listening to that song and becoming a bts fan  it just sounds like a generic radio song in the states    but bad instead of good catchy  if anything  one of the few people that heard it on the radio will just think   is this a bts song  how have they gotten so popular with this kind of music   and totally disregard them  ,0,656,122

yoongi  and i don t really have any bias wreckers lol  even though they all cause me pain  not because i don t adore the other men but because yoongi has just messed me up  and then when life was the one to mess me up yoongi was one of the major factors that helped me put my life back together again  taehyung was my initial bias for mostly superficial reasons  i mean  he really stands out in  boy in luv  amiright    his energy  and his gritty  grungy  deep voice  i fell in love more when i learned about the boys  personalities on ahl  but that was also when i started to notice yoongi but it wasn t until their next comeback that he devastated me like a ton of bricks  at first i was mostly curious and intrigued about what makes him tick  he simultaneously is subdued while exuding so much charisma  i distinctly remember watching the dance practice for  danger   yoongi s legs gleaming brighter than my future and thinking   just who is he  he s fantastic but seems understated  is that by choice  he seems like such a thinker   does he write   little did i know    anyway  as an introvert  i could relate  and when i found out that he was also caring and an artistic visionary  i was hooked  even before he dropped the mixtape that shook the world  his lyrics in  intro  the most beautiful moment in life  and  nevermind  resonated with me so deeply and a moment in my life when i was extremely indecisive  anxious about my future  and felt like i was a hollow person without a dream  you can see why bts hooked me in general  i was first year in college during the boy in luv era   i didn t even realize he had become my new bias until the point where it was undeniable and i couldn t look back  still have such a soft spot for tae though   everything after that just solidified his position in my heart and don t even get me started on how i felt when he dropped agust d ,0,1882,346

i probably won t be purchasing any  if only for the reason that i m not a super avid toy collector  i ve been eyeing the funko pops though  probably because they re more cartoony caricatured   i will say though that i don t think the mattel dolls were that bad  i didn t really expect them to be hyper realistic because that s not usually the point of their product  i e  producing realistic hair isn t as important as having comb able for the kids that will play with them   now if it was hot toys or hasbro i might have expected more of the realism expected by collectors ,0,574,100

i was genuinely impressed with this video  one of the guys has been following rm s career since he was runch randa and i thought it was really cool to get the perspective of someone who knew of rm from the beginning beginning especially since rm is discussing his persona and shadow  i did watch the dktv   if i spelled this wrong sorry  explanation and i generally liked it but i will say that i do agree with those who felt that he was looking at  personas  with a bit of negative point of view when it is just a facet of ourselves that we need to accept and understand  i really like how these guys picked up on everything so quickly and then relayed that information in a very easy to understand manner  a  in my book  i also watched their fake love reaction after this and the guy  who knew rm since runch randa  says more about that in that video  ,0,854,162

i feel like they pull off all genres really well so i am gonna be happy with any genre they put out  i hope there s a mix of upbeat as well as slow songs though  in saying that if they re gonna do hard core hip hop  i hope the lyrics aren t a alonf the lines of diss songs  don t get me wrong  i loveeee a good diss track including mic drop  ddaeng  all their songs tbh but there s a time and place for everything  i feel like they ve been validated enough now and don t need to hold to those particular negative emotions to fuel their creativity  this is a new era  they have themselves admitted that they ve let go of negative feelings so i hope the music reflects that  if they do go down that route again though  i ll probably still enjoy it but it may leave a bad taste in my mouth ,0,787,153

i had this random theory about the albums reflecting bts s musical journey so i am hoping that works out we get hiphop bts  but we can never truly predict with bts and their intro songs rarely sounds like the title so i think rather then hiphop we could get more emo bangtan because that would suit the theme of persona  well  i don t really have any strong preference for any particular genre so i would be interested with any genre they decide to try ,0,453,84

both dna and idol are those types of songs  which they already did  i hope we re past that ,0,91,18
i think i ve said this before  but people should draw a line between their off camera personalities or what they keep hidden and their on camera personalities or what they want to show us  i m not saying that our idols are  fake   but chances are that their personalities on camera are exaggerated or an extension of some part of their real personalities to present an  ideal personality  or  godly like  personality as a marketing technique to attract fans to the group or even the idol themseleves   lol  idols are humans as well so they re not perfect people  they have their own flaws  and they have the right of their own privacy  truth is  they only show like maybe 5 10  of themselves on camera and keep the rest to themselves because they have the right to do so   also  for these idols  their first and main primary priority is to promote their own artistry talents as much as they can  personality is just a bonus feature and again  a marketing strategy technique to promote their own group or even themselves in certain cases  so therefore  to support your idol s   you should support them for their talents and artistry first  the personality can come in later or as bonus points  ,0,1193,199

i really like that they re diverse and not scared of trying new genres  and i actually enjoy them in all their facets so i m open to pretty much anything  except for urban latin music but the chances of them doing that it s practically 0  but i really hope they don t throw a basic  bad edm song at us  the current trend of edm songs with horrendous beat drops and practically no chorus is awful and it s getting so common that i m a bit scared  i really don t want to see them do it ,0,484,92
100   i need u  prologue  run  young forever is the best thing that bts has ever done  artistically  aesthetically and sonically  run is an emo trap banger  i feel like they kinda revisited her with fake love  but i would love another run fake love type song since i think they re the best title tracks and also are the most appealing for the gp  ,0,347,63

if the theories are proven true of the three sub eras of map of the soul are supposed to be reflections of previous bts eras  then i would expect something hip hop and rock for this upcoming album  not too hard but something minimal enough to be classified under these certain genres kind of like  mic drop  for instance   based on the concept photos  if they re not april fool s joke   then something along the lines of rap heavy bubblegum pop hip hop  like  dna  except more rap or  dna  and  no more dream  infused  for their title track whatever it is  ,0,557,96

oh i love this thread  in bst i always hear yoongi say  kiss me on the ribs  ribs   sure  yoongi  if you insist  instead of lips which think has to do with the fact that in general they have quite a hard time distinguishing between   since they only have   in korean  when they pronounce english words  i think it s for that reason that they sometimes try to avoid saying l or r all together  if you listen closely to i need u  for example  in the beginning when they re supposed to say  fall  it sounds like  fah  and the  i need you girl  sounds a bit like  i need you gih   i love when i hear little linguistic peculiarities like that and i always smile when these songs come on because i just find it really endearing    ,0,725,139

aww  that video was cute  i guess jin has never been to an aquarium to pet stingrays in those little pool exhibits  \^ \_\^  but those stingrays were behind a glass wall  so    o \_o  there were big ones in the exhibit at the same size as the one in the video as well  but when i was there  they tended to hide from people except for a brave one that liked to swim around anyway  xp but when not in a pool exhibit  i imagine it must be a little scary seeing one so upclose  o \_o maybe jin thought the giant stingray would shock him becuase ii do remember reading in the past that they can produce electricity in some ways    o \_o   amp  x200b ,0,645,126

not a dumb question at all  there seems to be some confusion between you two so hopefully this helps  if you re buying a ticket and it s a mobile transfer that goes to your ticketmaster account  you re fine  if you re buying from somewhere like stubhub  just to be safe  avoid buying a ticket that says  mobile ticket  instant     those are the screenshot tickets  if it just says  mobile transfer  it will be a transfer which you ll get the email for and it ll be transferred to your ticketmaster account ,0,506,88

yoongi is known as a person who has very pale skin since debut  i don t think he is sick yoongi said his father also has pale skin  i think the reason why he looks more pale than before is because he didn t do much outside activity since he has to prepare their comeback  i am not sure but i heard somewhere that while other members do lighter tone make up  yoongi gets darker tone make up ,0,390,76

i m just so thankful that kpop is getting more recognition in the us  i believe this is because of bts  so i m thrilled that they get their own dolls  and especially that mattel didn t just give them the same face mold  and tried to capture each members qualities  they did amazingly well for a doll that will cost about  20  i will probably buy just one  because bighit took the rest of my money  just as a keepsake ,0,417,78

[  the whole video is hilarious  honestly  tae and jimin are a riot  you can also see jin being very sweet to people in other videos  in this one  he pushes through two other members to run to namjoon to see if he s crying after bang pd pranked him  [  in this video  jin was the only member who asked a woman why she was crying  the other members were either shy or acted ridiculous  which was super entertaining  yoongi cracked me up   [  jin also makes special efforts to include people in the fun during tv broadcasts when they re a bit left out  [  jin s 24 7 kindness is really important to me  he s worked very hard  despite coming from a background with money and an education  but he doesn t let his struggles make him angry or standoffish  he still expresses love and acceptance to those who need it   amp  x200b ,0,823,149

i d say namjoon is my ult bias  he can be an absolute dork and then just be really oozing sex appeal next  some of the songs i ve connected to the most are written by joon  i admire everything he s gone through as a leader  baby boy just wants to comfort us and us to be our best selves  and with the recent album releases  i feel we ve tended to have the same favorites  so that s nice haha  i get wrecked by ot7 so everyone has the capacity to bias wreck me lol  i biased hobi the longest because my god  his stage presence  i was a casual stan of bts and didn t really have a bias for the longest time and only really became an army for the start of the ly series  i only liked namjoon at that point and thought jungkook was cute  saw a hobi fancam for mic drop and i fell so hard lol  ever since  i ve enjoyed hobi s performances the most  he is so legendary  such a performer  when hobi smiles the sun rises and the birds start singing  ,0,942,184

article basically breaks down what is in each book and which audience might prefer which  pasting in quotes for anyone unable to access the site   both of the books deal with bts  but their approaches to the band are different   icons of k pop  looks into the characteristics of k pop as much as bts because it considers the band as representative of k pop  it analyzes how  idols  are born and interact with pop music consumers in korean society    the review   on the other hand  focuses on explaining why bts is different from existing k pop bands  most korean boy bands and girl groups are armed with the  total package  of singing  dancing and appearance  but they have been regarded as  factory made idols      icons of k pop  could be more interesting to bts beginners  as it explores the charm of each individual member  but to big fans of bts  this information is already well known  on the other hand   the review  could be difficult for those who are not bts fans  it is an in depth analysis based on the interviews with seven people  including billboard columnist jeff benjamin  ,0,1091,184

i would have to side with the rest of the comments section on saying the bts we see is definitely not who they really are although we have seen a lot of raw exposure on them  i ve discussed this same topic with friends before and i think it s all just a level of infatuation that our brain is tricking us into thinking we ve completely fallen in love  ,0,352,67

i love them  i m not  in  love with them  but i still love them all dearly  love comes in all shapes and sizes  do i know them personally  or know exactly what they re like off camera  nope  they ve only shown us glimpses of who they really are  but that s enough for me  i love them  and respect them  and admire them  i wish the very best for them  their happiness genuinely makes me happy  that s love  it s not the same love i feel for my friends or family or partner s   but it s still  a  love  honestly  i think you re making a bigger deal out of it than than it actually is  first of all  they  want  us to love them  that s the nature of kpop  hell  that s the nature of the entertainment industry  period  and the goal of anyone in it  they need to be loved to thrive in the business  artists don t make it very far when they aren t  as for people lusting after them   what s wrong with that  sexual humans beings are allowed to find other human beings sexually attractive  aren t they  i m pretty sure jungkook  for example  knew exactly what he was signing up for when he green lit the shirt lifting part of the fake love choreo  i m sure hoseok knows exactly what s going through our heads when he does his epic hip thrusts in baepsae  the list goes on and on  there s one thing to sexually objectify someone  that is  to reduce them to being sexual objects only  and it s another thing entirely to be sexually attracted to someone  for the most part  fans tend to be in the latter category  those who aren t   well  they get blocked  simple as that  ,0,1564,279

jin  i disliked him when i first saw him in danger mv because he kind of looked like a typical shy flower boy  and looked sort of awkward when dancing  he is still 100000x more amazing than me   then i watched a short 10min interview on asc and his personality shook me  i think all of them made the impression that they were not shy or awkward in front of a camera  but jin really stood out as he carried the flow of the interview  when i misjudge someone that badly i tend to fall for them straight after lol  also  i always find the little moments whenever he is on camera to be super entertaining because he is either embarrassing himself or the others  he truly blossomed after fire young forever came out and since then his constant barrage of hilariousness has kept me on the line ,0,788,146

the most i ve felt with bts in terms of   love  i guess  is that they re people i d like to be friends with   i occasionally have dreams with them in it  but usually it s just us having long ass convos or we re a group of superheroes people living in a post apocalyptic world  people going grocery shopping idk  it happened recently  and it was fun  trying to fight some giant villain survive find milk  we looked  everywhere    also  i can t even drink milk    any time i see comments like that i usually assume the commenter is young  to me that s anything under like 17 since i m 23 rn  and hasn t really thought too much about it tbh  i m fully aware  and namjoon likes to remind us sometimes  that however much they try to show us everything  they don t can t really  regardless  while i try not to be objectifying  i do   admire certain things that happen  tae in any singularity performance  for example  and that will  definitely  result in me tweeting something out of thirst ,0,985,166

yes  i remember them saying this  thanks for bringing it up  it s always interesting to see bts cover concerns like this  i m definitely not going against this  but i think it could be argued if it s ethical or moral  despite bts validating the behavior  to  use  bts  or others  as an emotional crutch  would we have the same view point on a relationship with someone personally close to us  or a friendship  but them being a celebrity brings a whole other complex and dynamic relationship that can be explored  i m not sure if you could ever be ethical with a celebrity because the position in of itself could be unethical and inhumanly impersonal  i think the relationship between a fan and celebrity is formerly unhealthy when you dissect it down to its barest form  anyways  i m just playing devil s advocate here with whatever thoughts that come to me  but i really like your last point though  it s important for fans to discern that especially  ,0,953,164

 gt i also would like to cover a topic of people utilizing bts to get through a rough time in their life and abruptly distancing themselves unstanning when they re in a better point in their life  could we say they re using them in a sense for their own self gratification  could people argue the validity of their being a fan  or could you argue that there is nothing wrong with utilizing them as a coping mechanism for a period of time  i d argue this is something they are not only aware of  but validate  namjoon has addressed it quite directly a number of times  such as in his now famous [ment from the wings final]    gt everyone that has acknowledged us  in everyone s dreams or lives  our existence  music  pictures  videos  even if it s just a little  let s say the pain is at 100  if we could at least make it 99  or 98  then the value of us  being here  is enough  as well as the ment from [a love yourself concert]   where his message is pretty on the nose   please use me  please use bts to love yourselves   after their emotional mama speeches at the end of last year  jungkook also talked about something like this in a fancafe post  to paraphrase  he said even when we have  let go of each others  hands    basically not their fans anymore at some point in life   they will be glad as long as they have been able to provide us some happiness  no matter how small  it s not uncommon for people to find and stan bts at a point in their lives when they need some kind of emotional support  the sense of belonging in a fandom or just a momentary haven of good feelings their content provides  i used to feel guilty about using them as emotional first aid and spent a lot of time wondering what kind of a give and take relationship this actually is  a bit after that  hope world was released and hobi also made his perspective pretty clear in p o p pt 1  these are only a handful of examples  but to me it s obvious from the way they speak that they have a very clear understanding of how they are being  used   and even encourage us to siphon energy from them in this way  regardless of what we end up giving back or how quickly we may move on with our lives  lately they have emphasized it even more  though it has always been kind of a part of their ethos since day 1  they have seemed to feel more responsibility about being a positive influence now that the audience responding to their ripple effect is considerably more massive  as long as we don t act entitled to their energy  demand more than they give  or rely on them in a way that crosses a line into unhealthy behavior  remember kids  kpop isn t a replacement for therapy   i wouldn t be too cynical about it and just take what they are willingly offering ,0,2732,503

my sister often tells me when she gets to know someone who she had romantic feeling towards  it always dies fast because she realizes that actually just really admired looked up to them  she is learning the bass guitar and is always falls for emotionally constipated bass players rip   when we become infatuated with anyone  especially celebrities  we often have expectations for our  ideal partner  that are set a little to high and are unrealistic  but as long as they learn the difference between a constructed fantasy and reality afterwards  maybe its not such a bad thing for teens to go through an experience like yours  and im sure as they get older and gain more life experience that they will  thank you for sharing    ,0,728,125

honestly when you dive deeper into fandoms communities of people you ll come to find that there are potential major ethical implications for many many things  it is a really complex topic to dissect  but i also believe it could be beneficial for people who currently use bts or any group artist public figure cope or have in the past  in healthy and unhealthy ways  to think about these things  on the sexualization topic  it is hard to ignore something when its omnipresent  they must be very strong to put up with everything thats projected onto them and its extremely admirable i know i would crumble under all of that ,0,622,106

i think it becomes really hard to separate admiration from romantic feelings especially when one is in their teens and early adolescence  atleast it was for me  i remember 3 4 years back  when i was 20  i started following a popular travel blogger on instagram  i loved what he wrote  over the next 3 4 days i went through his 4000 instagram posts and concluded that he was what i wanted in a guy  he had gone through so many hardships to follow his dreams and had the  underdog life  backstory  i had a boyfriend yet there i was daydreaming about some random guy  i was convinced that he was the ideal guy for me and would really like me if we ever met where he lived was just 6 7 hrs drive from my city and i even tried planning a trip with my friends to go meet him   eventually my fangirling and fantasies mellowed down   because yeah college does that to you   but i still admired him and really wanted to meet him someday  a couple years later him and i happened to be in the same place for a couple of months and i decided to dm him  we hung out a dozen times and yeah no surprises  i didn t like him and i kinda hated him  i still follow him since he writes really well but yeah that s that  i am sure he s a good person even though he behaves like an entitled a  hole at times but yeah he was nothing like i imagined he would be through his writings and photos  my disappointment was obviously my fault too since i constructed this persona without even knowing the person  i realised there s a reason they say never meet your heroes  had i not built expectations around his personality i am sure i would have liked him better  ,0,1636,309

i think my bias is jin after reading that  cake analogy  below   amp  x200b  the first people that attracted me to bts was jungkook s singing with charlie puth followed by his rainism dance cover  as a dancer myself  i loveeee watching good dances specially when they put in the perfect expressions to go along with it  so after that when i started watching their songs  bst  etc my eyes would always go to jimin thanks to his expressions or sometimes v  war of hormone   at this point i was loving bts but didn t have any bias or anything and i respected them all for their different talents   amp  x200b  i never even thought of  stanning  because i am always only a  casual fan  of entertainers  even in real world i don t have any people that i look up to or want to be like even though there are so many people i  respect    only time i  stanned  someone before was a female bollywood actress for a limited time    amp  x200b  however  as i watched more and more of their content and listened to more of their b sides solos  no videos so focussed on singing only   jin s voice always made me feel emotional  oh and v s when he sings in his low range  i never even realised when jin creeped up on me and instead of firmly looking at jimin everytime  i started looking for jin in videos  his personality had a huge part to play because initially i didn t get the hype about his looks  as much as i am a strong ot7 and really respect them all for their craft and attitudes  i don t think i could  hang out  with a lot of them if they were just someone i knew unless both parties put in a lot of effort  however  i can imagine getting along with jin like a house on fire   amp  x200b  i am ok with his dad jokes  i am impressed by his sassy humour  i love his serious side and how much he tries to be strong for people around him and never complains and i really  really respect his big  kind heart  he believes in working hard but rarely talks about how hard it is for him  he is kind and laid back but never a pushover  he knows how to get his point across or put people in their place if needed but he manages to do it without causing confrontation  he makes mistakes and goes overboard at times but always handles the aftermath well  he is self aware including his shortcomings but doesn t let that depress him and instead focuses on where he can improve   amp  x200b  i know many people who are successful  talented  intelligent  hard working or funny and confident but i rarely come across people who are all of that and on top of that kind without forgetting their roots  ,0,2580,477

i really really wanted to touch on disassociation coping mechanisms in this post but i was afraid of offending or crossing the line with those who have personal experience with those things  i believe it is more common than not  and it may be very hard for some to separate music from the artist or fantasy from reality  which is why i have been putting an emphasis on younger folk   even if the industry is focused on marketing fantasy i just hope that bts arent placed in uncomfortable situations too often  especially regarding sasaengs and the like ,0,553,96

i think there s really no way to find that perfect balance when you re a public figure like bts  they re essentially selling a fantasy  especially when being in the idol market  which is hyper fixated on selling a particular wide spectrum fantasy to fans  there will be people who take that idealized fantasy  sexually or romantically  and project it onto bts and those people  as harsh as it seems  could have a disconnect with reality in a sense  kind of straying off topic slightly  in another sense  people also utilize bts as a coping mechanism and this could also blur the line of blending their own fantasies onto bts in order to disassociate from their reality as well  this can both be sexualized fantasies or it can be other fantasies related to what they re not able to obtain from their own reality  it s not always malicious  realistically  there will always be a certain level of projection onto bts no matter because we don t know bts intimately  fans essentially have to fill in the blank spaces that they re not provided with  it s an incredibly unusual relationship ,0,1084,182

this happens in real life as well  to adult and teens alike  you can  fall in love  with the idea of someone  those comments on youtube or young fans thoughts are not our concern  practically every teen the world over has had a phase where they thought what they were feeling was in love  love  when it comes to celebs  eventually they grow out of it and it just becomes a part of their fond or cringe for some  memories of their teen years  now the other issue you came across is people leaving  thirsty  comments  i think appreciative comments are perfectly fine and expected by anyone who joins the entertainment industry  i also highly doubt the group is even aware of or seeing 99  of these  so again it s not something i choose to be concerned over or police others on  comments that are going to far  which i ve legit read some explicit as heck comments getting anatomically graphic  you can report  leave a comment back to the person or as i do  move on from them  they are thankfully rarely seen and don t need any extra attention drawn to them  personally i can honestly say i love them but i m also aware the them i love is but a shadow of who they actually are and i m okay with that  as i m not in love with them and don t need to know them personally  to be able to appreciate love the image they want to portray to us  love comes in far too many shades and appreciation styles  as do expressions of love  for me to be judging every other comment i see and being concerned over it  ,0,1496,279

yes  love is very complicated and there are many different kinds of  love   i think a problem with people not  maturating  comes down to the fact that they may be putting themselves in an environment where they cant  for example  surrounding oneself with many other  delusional   obsessive  fans can hinder one from recognizing media and the industry influence if that makes sense  lots of people build community based off of similar interests and form echo chambers of sorts ,0,476,78

if they are very young  they will grow out of it  i swore i was going to marry my first celebrity crush  did not once consider logistics or legality  because we were destined dammit  i also wouldn t take comments 100  seriously  just because a person makes thirsty or unrealistic comments doesn t mean they ve lost touch with reality  i ve made a few myself even though i have no desire to date a celebrity i don t really know on the other side of the world through an interpreter,0,480,86

i definitely don t  love  them as in i m in love with them  when i say i love them i kind of mean it in a causal way  definitely not in the same way i love my family or friends  however i don t blame the  young  fans  i m young myself  for perhaps believing they are in love with the members because the kpop industry does try and paint idols like the ideal boyfriend girlfriend to make people infatuated with them  tbh i think as people mature they ll be able to separate real life love and adoration for celebrities  also i ve actually seen quite a lot of obsessive older fans too so i don t think it is necessarily a case of young fans being delusional  it comes down to maturity ,0,683,127

every idol s public persona is deliberately constructed to be the  ideal   with enough gaps to project whatever you want in  that s their whole deal  being there to be romantically projected on is literally their job  and what the companies capitalize on to keep the system running  so this phenomenon is kind of boosted and blatant with idols  but it happens in normal life as well  it s easy to fall in love with the idea of someone  i had a big crush on a gentle looking manbun sporting oversized offwhite sweater wearing uni acquaintance of mine and fantasized about napping with him in the evening sun talking about poetry or some shit   until i actually got to know him and learnt he s an elitist asshole who despises art  i got to be on the other side of it too  there was a guy who knew me for a full year  was madly in love  yet made no attempt to actually get to know who i am  he gave me a nickname of a high ranking military officer  because that s the kind of persona he wanted me to be and the projection he was actually in love with  so  it s a human thing  bts are part of the idol system that capitalizes on it  they protect a more private side of themselves  as is healthy  while showing us some  presumably still genuine  sides they want to show  there s nothing wrong in being attracted to that  as long as you are aware of this dynamic  don t fall into the delusion that your projection is real  and treat actual people in your life with the respect they deserve for all their rough edges and flaws  it won t be harmful ,0,1541,281
hobi     look at him go  it s so cool of him to give like this  so inspiring  ,0,78,16
as far as the members go  i think those silly comments are mostly harmless as long as the members have fulfilling personal and professional lives  they knew they d be objectified to some degree as idols  but they do also mitigate that relationship with their own videos and messages  also  the members tend to not say things that imply there s any hope of a relationship with a fan  and jin even tells fans to stop asking absurd things  like for marriage  i think saesangs and obsessives are an issue  but that s not most fans  and honestly  that they have parts of themselves we don t and can t know is not a criticism  it s the nature of life  because people are complicated and multifaceted  it s healthy that bts has their parts that are theirs alone  because that means they have identities and self worth completely separate from us  they deserve that ,0,858,147

this is a pretty interesting train of thought  i mean when i say i love them i don t mean romantic love  i don t really want to date them or sleep with them  i think they re cute  fun  and entertaining so i say i love them in a light hearted way  i don t see anything wrong for seeing an idol in a sexual way  when it s not done to an extreme  it s kinda the same with women pining over channing tatum or any celebrity  obviously idols only show what they want to show and are sometimes limited to a contractual degree but i don t doubt that they show tiny glimpses of their personality or the things they are interested in  i don t know tae personally but i do know that he enjoys and at times has purchased art  listens to classical music as well as a broad genre and i can appreciate that and know it s a pretty genuine side of him because of how passionate he shows himself to be  but yes apart of them being idols and remaining single is that they re built up that way to essentially be idealized and romanticized  the perfect boyfriend  not everyone can agree or feel that way but it is what the business model is built around  hence the non dating rules  no female idol interactions  ,0,1191,223

oh man i never thought i would stan someone in my late twenties until min yoongi came into my life  i had casually listened to bts like right before they started making more tv appearances for dna and i saw white haired yoongi and he looked so shy and kinda like he didn t want to be there  and i was like whoa who s that guy like  he just stood out to me  i couldn t name all the members yet except for a few but i was so drawn to yoongi for some reason  and then i find out how open he was about anxiety and depression and what an advocate he is for mental health and i just became smitten with how intelligent and talented he is  namjoon is up there too like please don t get me started how admirable the man is  he carries a huge weight on his shoulders as the leader and translator for the group  and his musical abilities are on a league of their own  bts is special to me because they all stand out as individuals  and with so many boys groups out there  for me it s rare to find group where i want to know about all the members individually and not just a bias  ,0,1070,212

since there are just so  many  superheros  i narrowed it down to bts as x women  rm   storm   beautiful  intelligent  very powerful and in touch with nature  when she s given the chance to lead a team  she s an excellent leader who supports and challenges the people that she has to lead  she s diplomatic  regal and despite all the challenges and tragedies she s seen as a member of the x men  she stays strong and helps other people work through it  she speaks several languages and very well could have decided to stay in africa and be a weather goddess but instead chose to help the world not just with her powers  she also takes fashion risks  which is appropriate  jin   wolfsbane   at first she was just a shy wolf girl who had trouble opening up to people  but her time with the x force helped her open up and learn to trust people  have a little fun and be herself  wolfsbane worked incredibly hard to help her team  to become an important member and to open up to the people around her which i think suits jin really well  she also initially didn t believe in herself or her abilities but worked really hard to become the wolfsbane who helps her team and cares about   is cared for by the people around her  suga   x 23   at first  x 23 seems like this silent yet beautiful killer devoid of much else but a beautiful face and some wolvie claws  but in reality  she s kind of a goof that wants to help people  laughs a lot but is pretty scary when she wants to be  she also cares for the people around her so deeply that you can t always tell  like her dad   she s powerful and she honed those skills by training really hard and overcoming her upbringing to become an awesome leader  as an aside  in the logan movie  she fully pretended to not understand or speak english for like half the movie until it got to the point she had no choice  jhope   dazzler   at first glance  you might think i robbed hobi here but dazzler is awesome  she s a singing and dancing machine and her pyrotechnics may seem weak but that s just because she has an awesome amount of control over them  despite readers kind of thinking she was a goofy  stupid mutant for a lot of years  dazzler got clowned a lot   there s a reason the x men have been courting dazzler since the seventies  she can be a smiley  happy disco queen on stage but when its time to get things done she has no problem getting to buisness  jimin   pixie   half human and half faerie  pixie is beautiful  smol and very friendly  initially people really liked pixie  but her true powers came from her ability to protect the people she cared about without any worries about her own safety  she s super noble  really strong and despite some of the bad things that have happened to her as a member of the x men she never leaves  and of course  she s a literal faerie  v   jubilee   don t underestimate jubilation lee  she started out as a goofy  weird kid with firework powers and was commonly accused of being useless but through a lot of hard times she became an invaluble x man  i mean that  she survived great loss  she s an amazing leader and despite being a vampire now she doesn t let it hold her back at all and though she knows how to get serious she hasn t let life stamp out her youthful optimism and pursuit of justice  also  i firmly believe that she eats panda express  jungkook   kitty pryde   shadowcat is the golden maknae of the x men and always will be  she s really powerful  she s incredibly hardworking and she s not just a girl who pops through walls at all  and frankly has not been for decades   she s good at anything she tries  be it hand to hand combat  magic stuff  or traveling around space and leading a crew in cosmic mu shennanigans  also  when she was recruited  she only joined the x men because she looked up to storm  despite being the youngest x man for a long time  she learned a lot from the older members and has become an amazing leader in her own right  also she has a very cute little dragon  ,0,3991,734

from my comment history  it s quite obvious to say that kim taehyung  v  is my ultimate bias  when i pick favorite members bias of a certain group  it s usually who i think has the best voice or my favorite voice as a primary criteria along with whose stage presence attracts me the most as secondary criteria then personality comes in as optional or bonus points  to be honest  idols  first priority is promoting their talents artistry  personality is much more of a marketing technique to attract fans to the group or even the idols themselves lol    in this case  in my opinion i m probably part of a devil s advocate sort of type lol   it s taehyung  my favorite among the group  what makes it much more interesting is that he s the only lyric baritone vocalist in a tenor majority vocal line and pop industry overall  and most appealing stage presence to me  his facial features lmfao     not only that  though we re quite different in terms of personality  nothing conflicting  more like yin yang sort of thing   i relate to him the most out of all the group  along with jungkook  and he reminds me a lot of my more extroverted friends  especially my two best friends  he actually has exactly or almost exactly the same personality as my best friend before college  they re all talented and amazing in their ways though  i respect that     ,0,1346,228

namjoon is  1 bias  i think i got into his music before i truly got into bts   although i don t remember how  hah   i usually find myself listening to his solo stuff just as much as the group  i love how his voice can be gangster rap  but be totally sultry in the next verse  i admire how he is always visibly growing in maturity  he s one of the most natural english speakers in the industry too  i float between my  2 bias    jin and v fight for it      jin looks and sounds like a disney prince  when he has something to say with conviction  it s so beautiful    epiphany  autumn post office  most of his solo covers  i can t relate to him too much as he has a secretive persona as we all know  but i appreciate him anyway  i hope he gets featured in a drama someday since he initially wanted to act    v s low bass voice always gets me     and singularity is one of my all time favorite songs now even outside of k pop  i resonate with how v has a different  unconventional way of doing things  i was always made fun of for not being a linear thinker so i know what it s like when no one takes you seriously because there s always this wall between you and the world ,0,1171,226

as far as i know  all the tickets were sold out and sold fast  however  a large number of them were bought by scalpers who are now trying to resell  with so many tickets from scalpers on the secondary market  the prices are dropping  might be a great chance for army who couldn t get tickets when they originally went on sale ,0,326,61
this is why she s my bias  ,0,27,6
imo  no catch right now  like most have stated in previous comments  also the fact that the us has 3 stadium locations and each with 2 days  compared to the other countries with 1 location and 2 dates might be a factor in why there are still face value tickets available  many armys were expecting sales to be very similar to the last tour with scalpers getting way too many and bumping the prices sky high  so  if they were like me  they may have bought one or two tickets more than they needed just to be safe  sometimes it was for a friend who may have decided to go with a different seat or was able to get one themselves  but i m so glad to see that so many of us resold them to other armys at cost  this time  i think the 2 different sales dates  no confirmed price list  and short notice also kept out and deterred scalpers  mostly from round 2  since there was an immediate decrease on day 1 resale prices right after day 2 was announced  so maybe some of this  in addition to other previous suggestions  is also way we see more lower prices than we saw last tour  ,0,1073,206

the instrumental to this song sounds so fun and bouncy  an interesting contrast to the more pensive nature of the lyrics  the distortion in hobi s voice before the  eomma  in the beginning sounds so satisfying  the production is slick   the water drops in the instrumental give the song texture  it s a song i relate to on many levels  since my mom has been a pretty big part of my life  sweet and heartfelt  9 25 10,0,416,75

namjoon is my ult bias  my story is pretty typical i fell for his voice first when i heard him rap  he has an incredibly unique vocal color especially amongst idols  and as i became further acquainted with the group i began to realize how vastly encapsulating his mind is  he s one of the most evocative spoken people i had ever come across  and his mind is sort of just this rich inner world of ideas that he emotes perfectly through his music  furthermore he s somebody that s just so easy to look up to  and his existence simply garners one s attention  namjoon is this person who just wants to help and do right by people  he s so resolute in his morals and those goals that he won t let anyone stop him or tell him he can t  sometimes when i look at him i can t help but think he s just this really cool guy who respects and loves everyone around him so openly  and that s just a good way to go about living your life  ,0,924,174

maybe because bighit only gave fans less than 2 weeks to allocate money for the concerts  not everyone has money lying around for a concert announced out of the blue  plus  for the chicago concert  day 2 is on mother s day and i know a lot of people celebrate it with their families so it s difficult to get out of  other reasons for why it s not sold out   travel is expensive difficult  exam time  waiting for prices to drop more when the dates come closer  can t splurge on a other concert date since love yourself tour from last year was only half a year ago   waiting to see what the playlist is before committing to buying a ticket,0,637,117

joon   dragonite moment and the twt post as well as astronaut joon jin   whenever his ears go red  it s so endearing and he s the cutest at that moment to me yoongi   every time gummy smile   i specifically like the one where tae said armys love his gummy smile and he smiled so wide at the camera for armys hoseok   when he asked the members to protect him  it was so cute i m gonna combust   jimin   the video where he got jealous of the hwarang cast saying  i love you  to each other but tae not say it to them and he was so pouty cutely it was lovely taehyung   being scared of large sea creatures  shark  and the way he acted in bv2 for that shark cage was so cute jungkook   i adore his jungshook expression and it s so cute to me bts   whenever they are eating  it s so endearing to see them eat well and deliciously and it makes me hungry i m a lazy eater    i ve gone without meals before  bad for me  but it was hard to get out of the habit    i usually watch bts eating vids jin mukbangs as i eat my meals to encourage myself to eat  when they listen to music and enjoy it simply because it is music and not ppl enjoy all kinds of music like they do  everything can be music to them and it s really cute ,0,1215,244
tbh i don t know if i ve really grasped the concept of bias  but i do tend to gravitate to v more because of the neo soul style of solos he s done so far  but every one does something so freaking well is so individualistic in personality that it s so hard for me to choose a favorite lol  they also all make me melt in photos and videos  but v and jin even more so lol ,0,369,73
i d say ot7 just because i ve biased or been bias wrecked by   every  single  member  at least once     that being said  namjoon has kept the bias spot the longest  jimin the second  hyung line has been dominating the top spots on my list for the past year or so  but jk and tae occasionally jump all the day to the top   amp  x200b  hoseok knocked the air out of me at the concert  that s it  that s all  that man is the alter ego of the god of stage presence and i refuse to believe anything else because between his white suit and his even whiter teeth during just dance  he was literally blinding  there is a joke about white sun and stars in here somewhere  but i am not an astro major so big sad  ,0,703,134

mine is jimin  first off  his voice is so undeniably angelic that i feel religious just listening to him sometimes  then  he has the ability to be both insanely sexy and adorably cute within the span of mere seconds and that s some magician caliber talent right there  thirdly  his dance skills in various forms are truly a sight to behold and worship  ,0,353,62

when i discovered bts  j hope instantly stood out to me  his intense passion for dance shone through in every mv and after 7 months of getting to know the boys  i ve found there is so much more to him than what s on the surface  people tend to not look further than  sunshine angel hobi   and miss out on a lot of his true duality  like with mang  most of what we see of hoseok is a mask  he s a performer  and he holds his true thoughts  personality  and interests close to his chest  a portion of the real jung hoseok shines through in his hope world mixtape  piece of piece and daydream especially  and i remember in the behind the scenes of spring day he mentions the blurring of the j hope character and jung hoseok  the performer  i relate to him in that way  working in customer service as an introvert is hella difficult  i have to force myself to be someone i m not for a shift in order to make others feel more at ease  i remember one member saying that hoseok gets tired easily when he has to be  on  which i instantly recognized as minor social exhaustion  he can be cynical  lose his temper  think pessimistically  he gets zits  indigestion and gains weight  it s these flaws and contradictions that attract me  because it s so imperfect  as fans we tend to put these boys on pedestals  but i find it much easier to love a human than a god ,0,1353,251
my bias is kim namjoon because i m in love with his mind and the way he speaks  my bias wrecker is park jimin  his dance flow is my weakness  i will never get over him dancing while blindfolded at the 2016 mama  but i am also ot7 because like you mentioned  they are admirable and talented in their own ways  i adore them all regardless ,0,337,65
like when you have children  and you don t pick favorites    but sometimes you understand one child more than the others  or naturally get along with them better  but you don t love the others any less  so ot7  but that being said  sope  idk why both of them  since they are so different  yoongi just has sleepy creative feline energy  and i love that  hope has fluidity and brightness  but you can tell he s deeply complex with the things he doesn t show us  and pair them together  they have a great dynamic  also yoongi looks happy with hobi always  and i wish i had a hobi too,0,580,106

    warning  spoliers ahead      for jin  i was thinking of spiderman  especially the tom holland version  spiderman  especially the tom holland one  has a sense of humor  gt   and you see in the avengers civil war movie when he s the comic relief in the movie   lt  and a youthful vibe to him  with his dad jokes and his youthful energy even as the oldest of bts  jin is pretty quite fitting for spiderman  especially the tom holland version  maybe captain marvel  the female one  not the dc one  for his dry wit  sassiness  and rebelliousness especially with the dad jokes  playful bickering  and jinhit entertainment joke  like in his eat jin  vlive during the american leg of the ly tour he indicated on how he doesn t follow what the agency says when he tried to drink wine in fron of the camera lol     for taehyung  i was thinking of wonder woman  yep my ultimate bias with my most favorite dc superhero ever      especially his evolution as a member of bts and an idol  wonder woman came  gt   into  man s world    lt  as a na ve idealist  not thay she was dumb  but it s just that it was a whole new world for her as she grew up in an all female somewhat utopia world  but her experience as time passed made her a wiser and more introspective person  gt   especially in the war in the wonder woman movie   lt   i think it s the same for taehyung as well  he came into bts as a seemingly na ve and very youthful boy  not that he s dumb  he s pretty intelligent  but he came from a rural upbringing that was immune to the intensity that the idol life and city life provides   however  as bts became more famous  we got to see his growth in maturity and his more introspective side more  both wonder woman and tae are loving and quite idealistic in their beliefs  for wonder woman  she s willing to fight for those who she cares the most  gt   avenging for steve s death in the movie   lt  along with her beliefs in justice and equality  for tae  you can see him hyping and caring for the members  maybe bot as outright as jimin  but in subtle ways such as praising hobi for his looks and telling him that he likes him too much in hobi s b day vlive  buying rm the gift that rm has always wanted in bv3  stepping up to mention jin s graduation from colleg when the staff  i think  was talking about jungkook s graduation in the spring day comeback show iirc  hyping up yoongi s rap  buying the thread for jimin in bv3 when jimin needed some and praising jimin s artwork when the members were praising jungkook s artwork and paid no attention to jimin who also did as well  second time bringing jungkook in  i m sorry  jk   and got jungkook out of his shell and became his first close friend when jungkook was at his shyest  especially the showers    and his idealism as well  his famous ot7 quote love all 7 members and don t leave any of them behind iirc   i think he s also a bit of captain marvel as well with the surprising amount of talents that he has in store  he s the secret second  golden maknae  as well   shhhh   gt   just like when captain marvel tried to free herself from captivity by her former fellow kree civilizations  she unleashed all the power that she had resulting from the alteration she experienced  which also resulted in loss of memories  when she crashed into kree but was oppressed by a device in her neck that she freed herself from when she was freeing herself from captivity   lt   i think it s the same for taehyung as well  as a singer  dancer  contemporary artist  photographer  saxophone player  piano player  stage performer  composer  producer  intelligent and creative thinker  etc  also  not to be haughty or anything  but i think i put this idea  bts to superheroes  under a shazam post under this subreddit the other day  thank you for creating this post   ,0,3806,667

 gt i had thought i d gotten over much of my shyness but coming to korea and not knowing the language has hit hard  i used to say every day i lived in japan felt like the first day of school  so it s funny to see your comment on a post about first day of school anxiety  the feelings can be very similar  like you re not 100  sure how to fit in or what to say  you re intimidated to talk to people because you re afraid of making a mistake  and you feel like everyone is looking at you all the time  the worst mistake i ever made language wise was trying to order mushroom pasta  but getting the word for mushroom flipped up and accidentally ordering  shit tree  pasta  when you think about  what s the worst that could happen   that s pretty much the pinnacle  right  cursing while trying to order pasta  but thankfully  the waitress giggled and explained the word i wanted  it s been 10 years  and though i doubt the waitress ever thinks about that incident  and if she does  i bet she s laughing  not offended   but for me  that mortifying mistake turned into a good memory and a funny story  so i hope op continues to push forward in class and i hope you ll go to that macaron store  you ll either breeze through it like a champ  or  come out with something the clerks won t remember in 10 years but will be a great story for you  i wish both of yall good luck ,0,1365,252

i think you re at least partially right  the individual and group selfies could certainly be an allusion to that  a selfie is a representation of ourselves  made by ourselves  posted so that people will see that aspect of us that we want them to see     they re what everybody puts online and so we automatically do it too    it s part of our online role persona  but i don t know if they would want to focus and make the album all about that     especially when so many people point to social media as the main reason why they ve succeeded so well  too ironic as a focus but     as a part of a theme    ,0,604,115
that s a good point about the previous attempts made in english by kpop artists  i just don t think wonder girls or cl had a strong enough base in the us to begin with  or at least nothing close to what bts has now   boy groups tend to spark more interest passion from fans in the us  i think previous forays into the us market by korean artists were made prematurely  without any demonstration of success preceding them  our boys  on the other hand  are at peak growth in the us right now  with proven marketability and sales via concert tickets and music sales  but the truth is  at this moment  bts  influence in the us and the western world is largely confined to metropolitan areas with large numbers of minorities  they re not yet a household name  though i believe wholeheartedly that they can be  i just don t know if it ll happen with so much resistance to them singing in english  and now s the time for big hit to really think strategically about bts  growth here  while their momentum is at the highest it may ever be  things change quickly in the entertainment world  and thank you for the encouragement    i understand that many people here just want to protect bts  as do i  maybe speaking from a more business focused standpoint comes off a bit cold  but i love the boys and just want them to succeed   amp  x200b ,0,1330,237

you ve typed a really wonderful response dissecting the issue  my take was just an attempt to see how perhaps bighit bts might feel from a more personal standpoint  knowing that bts themselves have mentioned their participation in the direction of the group  but definitely we have no absolute idea their personal takes on the issue  would just like to add on the  don t fix it if it ain t broken  mentality  past advances of kpop artists with english singles  wonder girls with like money and cl with lifted  have not done as well as expected  and i do remember many accusations about how the singers are losing their roots by conforming to generic american pop in favour of mass appeal  it is likely that bighit wants to be more careful  cheers though  your response was well thought out and explained so don t worry about the downvotes    ,0,842,145

i don t think he was afraid to work his ass off   follow a strict schedule since he seems very dedicated  but i wouldn t be surprised if the mood was more friendly respectful at bh than bigger places  like  when i was 13 i registered for a tough magnet school for hs despite knowing it d be a lot more work  and part of what i loved about it was they treated us more like college students   respected our intelligence and gave us more freedom than normal high schools  like  no bathroom passes  just get up and go if you need to  but it s your own problem if you miss something when the teacher is lecturing   being treated like an adult is an incredible feeling as a teenager  ,0,678,127

i think armys  what with our history of having to defend ourselves for years  are fairly good at trying to stop massive spread of misinformation  if there is misinformation spreading  we ll try to flood it with corrections and there is an attitude of trying to not engage unless it s defensive  there are few bad apples  but we try to not spread wrong information in massive organized way  the other fandoms that hate us don t do this though  if they spread wrong information and they get caught  they don t put out the correct information  sometimes they even post it on their large twitter accounts with english translation  and when it s proven they re wrong  they pretend nothing s happened with no corrections  i m assuming it makes it difficult for their international fans to actually find the correct information sometimes unless they actually go to other fandom sites  i think they will catch up though  especially as new groups come along without the old baggage  i remember international fandoms were saying bts was not popular in korea  only internationally  for like a whole year after everyone in korea agreed bts was popular in korea  so i think it just takes time  ,0,1181,197

honestly  i am really surprised he didn t pick jyp  at his age  with 7 offers in hand  one of which is one of the big 3  he must have either had a really bad feeling about them  or had a spectacular feeling about bh  thank god for namjoon ,0,239,48
i know this is probably an irrelevant  unrelated point but as i was reading that i thought about the fact they re holding selfie sticks with photos of themselves in the concept photos and also they fact they re almost   posing in the bathroom mirror as you would to take a group shot to post online etc  i think it s a really good point  in a way i hope so because i d love to hear their take on it  especially as they themselves don t have individual social medias or instagrams   i think it d be a really interesting concept ,0,527,94

i think this is in part on purpose   they all look a bit  unreality   and the concept is meant to make us a little uncomfortable if that makes sense  it s like a weird uncanny valley that is a reflection of their personas  maybe   ,0,231,44

haha no problem   let me know what you think about it after you watch it  ,0,74,17
i never buy more than one version but i seriously feel  at this moment  like i have to buy both version 1 and 2  let s pray that doesn t turn into version 1 4 when the remaining concept photos are released ,0,206,39
i find your take especially interesting because my interpretation was slightly different  i saw the version two scenes portrayed as them putting on a face  praticing expressions before the mirror  they achieve good balance in that we are invited to suspend our disbelief   it would have worked if these were fictional characters in a film   but the context precludes that  effectively making us more aware of the camera and the reality that this is all a photo shoot  both interpretations can work well with the persona concept  excellent catch about the toothbrushes ,0,568,94

thank you for such a civil response    i m sad to see that so many fellow army have downvoted my comment  which is just my opinion from a business standpoint  i want bts to have as much success as possible throughout the world  we can t presume to know the boys  individual feelings on this issue  but big hit is a business and they need to make money  so my comments are speaking toward that  until now  the kind of success bts is seeing in america is something k entertainment companies have only dreamed of  that s why they put an english speaker in just about every group   they ve been doing this since the mid 2000s at least  when i first got into kpop   bts is the first one to really gain a foothold here  so they re the first with the potential to really profit from creating songs in english  the argument of losing their identity is tough to believe given that they already released wiom  which is fully in english  and though i agree that singing in japanese has been normalized for korean singers  i don t agree with the other fans saying this is because the japanese and korean languages and culture are similar  the languages may be closer to each other than english  but the cultures and identities of the japanese and korean people are very different  if we don t remember this  we risk encouraging the  all asians are the same  stereotype that artists like bts are helping to break  korean artists have been singing in japanese for so long because the japanese market is highly profitable  and now bts is the first with a chance at that same level of success in the us market  that s why they re the first to be confronted with this decision to  or not to  sing in english  and if they want to become a household name  it s something that should be re considered   p s  i m sooo proud of the boys  success thus far  back in the mid 2000s  i never would ve believed a kpop band could blow up in the us like they already have  it s a huge testament to their talent and hardwork  ,0,1995,357

y all i have my tinfoil cap on and i think the fact that they re taking pictures using phones photo booth refers back to the concept being persona   since persona means how you want people to perceive you and when you take selfies it s throughly measured by you on what you want people to see and think        also they all look mighty fine i love these photo booth esque sorta grainy pics   especially the ot7 ones  ,0,417,76

miss right  it s a sunny day song we hit the road early with the windows down and enjoy the breeze  we ll go to a little restaurant and pick up lunch  then head over to the park and eat it on a blanket in a grassy area  we talk about silly scenarios and how we would react to them  tell each other dorky jokes  relive fun memories of our pasts  and discuss interesting facts with each other  before we leave  we chase each other around  hiding behind trees and peeking out  only to end up out of breath and laughing in a heap on the grass while looking up at the sky  head to a bookstore afterwards and search the shelves for something new to read  as we look around we talk about our favorite books  authors  and subjects we enjoy  as the discussion goes on  we end up tugging each other deeper into the shelves where no one can see so we can steal kisses from each other  we leave the store with only one book but a lot of sweet memories  then we hit some clothing shops  not really buying anything but just trying on outfits that the other person has picked out  some outfits look silly and cause us to giggle while others blow us away because the other person looks so good  we leave the clothing stores and head to a home goods store  as we walk around and look at decor  we talk about our dream home  how we would decorate it and what it would look like  this leads to conversations about our ideal future concerning spouses and family life  one of the sales clerks mistakes us for a newly married couple and we go with it  we hold hands as we walk around the store  it s getting close to sunset now so we decide to head out for ice cream  as we sit outside the parlor and watch the sun fade  we talk about our dreams and goals  the night ends with us realizing we re more alike than different ,0,1800,340

agreed  in a way it was a huge risk at that time to go to a no name company compared to the other more known ones  jyp is still doing really well  cube is doing pretty decent too but i hate how they handled the hyuna scandal so dodged a bullet there too   kookie was brave child to take that risk and his parents were pretty supportive to let him try it ,0,354,72

following up from what other people have said about the comeback trailers being the intro track of an album  bts have been using intro  outro and skit as their own distinct album structure since debut  when i say distinct i mean among k pop groups  because it s actually inspired by older generation hip hop mixtapes which we all know they were initially trying to emulate  by keeping the album structure this way  they re effectively able to thematically organise their discography in a way that enhances the listening experience  the intro was initially only performed by rm because he was the center of their group  the draw or talent  therefore  his rapping was forefront and center  firstly as the opening solo rap  and secondly as the marketing material   the comeback trailer  now that their music and group balance has branched away from a rm centric structure  the intro  and therefore comeback trailer  has become the somewhat iconic album teaser that it is regarded as today  because of their roots  you don t really see other groups with this particular kind of trailer  i hope this answers your question ,0,1117,184

its really silly to think that bts  bang pd  their producers  all the staff  and the years of preparation that goes into all of their comebacks would cause anything previous to  go away   going back to their roots does not mean the same  do you speak korean or have you seen the lyrics for the comeback trailer  its so beyond different then the begging  that man has grown  hes different and the music is different  also to touch on your point  the amazing singers not getting to show their talent   what does that mean  sla  o rul8 2   dark and wild has a lot of singing  hip hop isnt just rapping  besides rapline only songs they always have singing in their songs  they have put so much work into this comeback  the storyline  the theme  the connection to their past selves  past music and more then we obviously even know yet  nothing bighit and bts does is on a whim and not planned out  if anything it sounds like you are disappointed with the trailer and you are afriaf its gonna sound like that because you prefer the songs with minimal rapping  which is totally fine you are allowed that opinion   to say going back to their roots would be a mistake or to make everything a waste makes me sad  ,0,1203,219

i have no idea if they d planned it from debut or not  but definitely from some point early on  just before bst wings  when they put out all those  film shorts   that was a period i mentally called battlefield  theory  or theoria hysteria  there was massive theorists going around at the time  some pretty much literally went through all the past m vs frame by frame looking for clues  turns out there were things placed in the scenes and sets of past m vs that linked it all together  i e  words  phrases  symbols   but up until the members  individual  short films  came out  none of it was never noticed because   well  no one had any idea of the background storyline to know to even look for anything like that  there are dozens tons of people that put up yt vids about wings theorem  just in case you or anyone else is interested  i ll try and dig up the particular ones i m thinking of and edit them in here ,0,914,163

it s definitely not pointless  regular ticketing means scalpers can use bots helpers to bulk buy across their many accounts  this way means they d have to be just as lucky as anyone else and only 1 per winning account  it does help a lot  and this way gives me so much more hope for my own chances  i m almost never successful at ticketing      i hope they don t check ids even though i know that s part of the full on warfare against scalpers  i know maaaany army including me who have no choice but to fork out for resale sometimes  it s our choice to do so  but i d rather pay more and go  than not  a lot of us work during ticketing so it s not even just bad ticketing luck  although that s part of it    sigh  let s hope i have better luck in lotteries  ha ha ha     ,0,772,144

i have to agree with you on this one  i think it would be more honest if they were to say that singing in english is just not something they re skilled enough at right now  i m sure rm s statement originated from their pr and management teams  and i think it s a poor decision on their part  big hit is putting great time and effort into promoting bts in the us already  and the market here is the biggest in terms of potential profit  learning english and one day singing in it would do a lot to help the band grow here in the states  and it would make the fans here feel even more loved as well  singing in english doesn t mean that anything about the band and what they stand for has to change  it would be a means to spread their message even further and touch the hearts and minds of more people  just like they do in japan  i get it though  most of the members  english pronunciation just isn t proficient at this time  but again  the company should just be honest about it ,0,980,187

i nearly had an internal meltdown yesterday morning  sorry that s so dramatic   i d been looking forward to getting the ly dvd since before they announced it into existence  which was me just hoping they would come out with one before hand  when it was announced and pre order s went up  a friend and i decided to order it together to save a bit on the shipping  little did they know  bh cancelled the order and they didn t check their bh account until the day of release  at that point bh had already sold out of the dvd s on their online shop  so we emailed them and got a refund with little explanation of what happened  a few days later  a local go was happening and were taking bids on the remaining stock on a merch site that was selling it for the same amount as bh  it just so happened that we were on that same merch site debating on whether we should purchase it  after getting led around by the go site  we were told we wouldn t be getting the dvd  the moment they informed us  the remaining stock on the merch site went out of stock  which led me to believe they were ordering from the same place we were looking at  it was really frustrating and in hindsight  really unethical of the go to host a silent auction for an unknown amount of stock and taking advantage of that fact  in that moment  my heart sank to the depths of where ever it could go  i had been wanting the dvd because i got into bts in 2018 and went to their ly concert last year  it was something to remind me of the wonderful memories of the show i went to  the good news is  i managed to find another site still selling it  but wouldn t be releasing it until early next month  maybe there will be another round of order by bh  but at this point i m not taking a chance  crossing my fingers the dvd s arrive safely to me  also  bought the kim youngdae bts review  english version  same day for retail therapy purposes  looking forward to all my stuff coming in after the dvd fiasco ,0,1963,371

 gt if they say that it is inauthentic to sing songs in english  a language they don t speak  why isn t it inauthentic to sing songs in japanese  a language they also don t speak  i ll like to hear what they have to say about that  i didn t think they were  the above is specifically what i was addressing  not the value of them potentially singing more in english  but why they feel doing so would be  inauthentic  at this point in time vs  their singing in japanese  i was trying to touch on the history of japanese songs in the k pop industry and why it s different and not  inauthentic   the point was never that bts said they don t want to sing in a foreign language  it s that giving into the pressure to sing in english would only be just that  giving into industry pressure  they could very well decide some years down the road that they want to create all english tracks  and if they do so it won t be inauthentic because it would be coming from a place of organic creativity  right now they don t see the point in terms of their identity  so they don t want to do it  even if it means sacrificing further commercial success  which has been the selling point of a lot of those in the industry who are encouraging them to do so   creating music in japanese may help boost their finances there  but japan as a stage for k pop has been present for a long time  and singing in japanese must feel less contrived than singing in any other language  i thought that s mainly what op wanted to discuss more  not why bts doesn t want to sing in english specifically ,0,1565,283

thank you  \^ u\^ yes  i did hear of this universe that some of their videos connect with each other  a wonderful army fan gave me a list of them in order and i should get to watching them all again  \^ \_\^  it s just that there is so much bts content out there that i wouldn t know what to click or watch in order without a little help  hahaha      d,0,352,71
they ve already released songs in english  like mic drop remix and waste it on me  so i guess they re saying this so people will stop pestering them asking the same thing over and over again  lol  it d be way too complicated if they did the same they do with their japanese releases  just imagine having to release songs in korean  original songs in japanese and original songs in english  each with a different choreo  anyway  hope they ll write songs because they want to  not because they are being pressured to do this or that  ,0,532,94
i totally get why that moment of jimin touched you so much but i feel every single person s improvement shows how much they all commit to being better  bts members always point out how jin is the member who is most  consistent with hard work and improvement  but jin said his philosophy is  your hard work is only for you to know  which is obvious in how we don t get those moments of vulnerability from him but then members comment how he works hard alone for hours and hours  tae as well  i recently saw their wings commentary again and when tae s solo came on  he talked about how much he wanted the audience to focus only on his singing abilities and how he gave it his all  he said he didn t focus on expressions or anything and just wanted his voice to do the trick  he didn t break down or get upset but the simple statement and expressions revealed how much he wanted to be taken seriously as a  vocalist   i guess jimin has just always been open about his insecurities which is quite a beautiful thing in itself as it s not an easy thing to do and makes him strong in his own way  ,0,1090,206

another small personal example  i am tri lingual and find it easy to translate in between the two non english languages as they share same grammatical construct and many of the words can be directly translated  allowing for meaning to be conveyed without much loss  any kind of translation  regardless of the effort put into it cannot capture the intrinsic meaning of words  the wordplay  the cultural significance of certain phrases  the imagery invoked  reading something in a language and then reading it s translation often makes you realize how difficult it is to even think of conveying the meaning with context  i really admire the wonderful talented people in this fandom who translate all bts media content for us viewers  without whom we would have been lost  if you have a primary language and you learn another language later in your life  you get into the groove of translating sentences because you think in the language you are comfortable in  bts is involved in the process of creating their music  they pen down their emotions and this is what resonates with the audience  if they don t feel comfortable in english  if they feel that they will be unable to convey their emotions through that medium  who are we to judge  ,0,1238,208

i do think that there is a larger overarching era  that ties in different eras you mentioned  and i do think that persona is probably last part of the bigger overarching era  i m not convinced they planned this from the start  i feel like they probably just tried to finish the school era at the beginning  and i wanna almost go back in time and pat them on the back for not going bankrupt and finishing the school era  around wings  it was clear that they were really making this thematically connected  instead of episodic  not sure if they planned it around the contracts  but it makes sense that they would have loosely worked the schedule to finish one story before enlistments start  etc  bts is so fun  each song tells a story  each album tells a story with a beginning and an end  albums bundle to create an era that tells a story  and even eras bundle together to tell a story  that seems to now have something of an intro  progression of story    and are we getting the denouement  if it is the denouement  it would make sense to have some reflection of the past path they ve traveled ,0,1095,198

i think its very telling that namjoon talked about  just trusting them  in his vlive followed by jin randomly mentioning in his vlive how he likes bighit because they don t just care about money but other things too and he thinks most fans like bighit too  they all must have noticed this anti bighit anti company thing going on recently   amp  x200b  i mean sure they may not be perfect but any company person working at such a large scale will make compromises every day  sometimes that may come at expense of  rest time  or whatever whilst at other times they prioritise themselves  shouldn t a company doing better be encouraged so others follow suit  how does dismissing their efforts and making blanket statements help anyone  this is how change happens not by people sitting on their seats  making extreme statements and  not trusting anyone    amp  x200b  i compare these people to those that  don t vote  because all politicians are crap and can t be trusted   well yea  maybe they can t but how does not voting and not having any say at all help in any way ,0,1067,181

just like all the other ceos of entertainment companies in korea  he has a hand in everything  how much may differ form project to project  music wise  right now with bts  i m pretty sure its less compared to the involvement in the past  bts are seasoned pros now but i rm has said countless times  he still gives his input when needed or asked  i remember rm talking about mic drop and how much angrier it was before bang pd got involved and suggested a change in tone that j hope gave it a different vibe  music wise with txt  i m sure he has more say so since they are new to the scene  however  bang pd is about developing his artist to do things on their own  so with each new project  as txt finds their own unique voice  he will let them take more control and become a back seat driver like he is with bts and step in when needed  overall though  nothing gets put out with the approval of him  you ll definitely see him on more projects for his artist in the future because he is a producer song write before anything else  like his artist  he is always creating and he gets to share that work via his artist and others in the industry  outside of music  he is definitely involved with the storytelling of each group and helping them get whatever their message is across through various contents too ,0,1307,243

 gt  i didn t know sunmi was getting hate for her interview  it s all over twitter honestly   paving the way  has always been used as a negative term to belittle bts s achievements so now when it s used by sunmi  people take it as if she is belittling everyone else including her former group  even if the meaning is to acknowledge the hard work of a group individual  people use it to discredit others and that s why this is taken so badly  it s honestly ridiculous ,0,467,82
that felt like such good news  bang pd has always struck me as more of a creative anyway  this change will take a lot of the bureaucratic stuff off his plate and will probably help bighit grow in the long run ,0,209,41
i know he worked with wonder girls and 2pm back during his jyp days  so i guess his roots are more in music rather than just business and management  he s quite impressive  i think the beginnings of the bangtan universe storyline are definitely his baby  and i don t know if he typically works on their music so much nowadays  but i get the impression that bh had tight creative control over all of love yourself in general  he and pdogg especially  perhaps because of the initially tentative foray into the us market  otherwise  he s probably more of a visionary conceptual overseer that approves projects and offers suggestions or changes ,0,641,108

i don t think it should even be much of a goal for k pop groups to make it in the west  though i suppose their companies would disagree  they re just fine where they are and can be plenty successful in korea  and maybe japan or china   in this sense bts might just be a unique example  but because bts has been able to do it and has reached this insane height of popularity  stans of other groups view their success with offense just because it wasn t their group  never mind if bts is actually talented and worked hard  they don t care about that  bts s success isn t enough to make other groups popular aside from making the market more open minded  but like you said that garners resentment rather than admiration just by nature of how k pop fandoms work ,0,758,135

i haven t been on international kpop communities recently  is that still happening  i didn t know sunmi was getting hate for her interview  it s strange  when fandoms in korea bashed bts and army  the i fandoms mimicked the hateful behavior  howe er  in korea  the fandoms no longer bash bts or army  the old fandoms that used to bash us had their bad behavior in trying to defame bts all aired out  now that army is so big  and the fandoms of newer groups are happy that bts is paving the way  i ve seen people from other even say that they re happy that army kinda ended the tyranny of the older larger fandoms   because they used to bash other fandoms a lot too  and they were often too small to fight back  the international fandoms are so slow to update  it is no longer fashionable to hate on bts and army  i read responses to sunmi s interview on general k forums  and the response was more like   well  that was very decisive and clear  lol  when she said bts paved the way  ,0,983,180

i remember being in middle school or maybe early high school when i saw wonder girls perform on tv  on america s got talent if i recall correctly   while i did listen to some k pop back then i wasn t familiar with them at the time  later on  i started really loving sunmi after  full moon  and rooted hard for yubin on unpretty rapstar  looking back  it kills me to find out that their us debut went that badly  i really thought  nobody  was such a bop but it s so hard for international artists in this market if they re not british  canadian  etc  so  yes  bts s success is so significant and if anyone has the right to boldly declare that from the rooftops  it s sunmi  it took so long for a successful k pop debut to happen in the west and it s unbelievably hard to break that inertia  i mean  it s been like 40  years since bruce lee s death and we re still struggling for asian representation in film  in some ways i d say it s even more difficult for music  aside from being an army  i m just so happy to see things going in the right direction as an asian american  i think we international k pop fans forget that our interests are still viewed as kind of niche in the western eye  despite the fact that there are so many of us ,0,1236,228

i feel like people are being deliberately obtuse with respect to the singing in japanese vs singing in english  there s more to be said about another asian moving into another asian space versus moving as an asian group holding onto their cultural identity into a western space  it s a statement to say you broke into a primarily english speaking industry that notoriously gatekeeps on those terms  see  despacito needing justin bieber for radioplay   even if that argument isnt there  it s their decision  end of discussion  if it bothers you  move on  stop telling or trying to convince them to  speak english  ,0,613,100
there is no kpop  community  or a  united  front  people only care about their faves  they don t care if kpop becomes bigger as a whole  in fact they only want their favorite groups to be able to do it and be the biggest  so that means no support for bts  especially from fandoms that know their groups won t be able to do it at all  i particularly don t care if bts  fame helps any group get more popular  because i don t care about kpop or the mainstream music scene  not to sound harsh   ,0,491,93

100   i hate when people weaponize legitimate problems movements to justify their fandom hate  so much of the hate bts receives from western non kpop fans is aimed at their perceived lack of masculinity or an old belief that  boy bands  have no depth  when a girl group tries to debut in the us  i d argue that the bulk of the obstacles they face aren t necessarily because they re women  but because they are asian  not english fluent  people are prejudiced  amp  judgmental towards other cultures  etc  i don t think it s all that different from the difficulties boy groups face  except  like you said  for the gender standards k pop boy group s also challenge  ,0,664,109

i think you re right  but it s also unfortunate that it s so true  i feel like k pop as a whole would do well in a  united  bid to break into the us market  as in  bts s success is a success for all of the korean music industry  but apparently not  k pop has always had such a territorial  confrontational flavor when it comes to fandom interaction and i m sad to see that it has even extended into this current discussion around sunmi  someone with first hand experience   merely being honest ,0,494,87

hmm  there s just so much gold to choose from  i m a lyrics nerd  so i think i d dig a comparative analysis for  no more dream  and  paradise   kind of an exploration into the lyrical shift  questioning whether they think it s a legitimate shift in perspective or if it s merely an expansion of the exact same concept  which i think is what it obviously is   i d also like to address how bts s journey and personal priorities might have contributed to the similarities and differences of this track duo  but that might only be good for an audience only made up of army s haha  if it was just an average audience  i think a presentation on the storytelling of the hyyh trilogy would be engaging  film technique  symbolism  themes of youth  mental health  etc       all of these seem topical and ripe for discussion ,0,814,144

keep in mind that the bulk of the japanese songs they release are only japanese versions of pre existing korean songs  even then  it s is extremely difficult to rewrite your song in another language  and practice them for live concerts  imagine how arduous this is for the rap line in particular  and  yes  relative to english  making japanese songs  is  exceedingly easier for them pronunciation wise  they grow up already more familiar with japanese terms  etc  just like english speakers in the us can grow up learning some off hand spanish  there is also several years of history where the japanese market has been closely supportive of k pop  be it because of their receptiveness to the korean market or their own history with j pop  it s not just a bts phenomenon  speaking of other k pop groups  they can aim content towards the japanese market while knowing that if they want to hold a concert in japan  they will be welcomed and it will be a success  not so with english speaking countries  just look at all the failed us debuts of other k pop groups in the past   in that regard  bts is indeed an exception  and even then only a recent exception  more so  making english content would feel like an attempt to appease an expectation  rather than a genuine choice that comes from passion or gratitude on their part  besides  putting in the effort despite their busy schedules to learn english in interviews is something we should be very grateful for  i personally think that s a lot to ask already  but it s meaningful to them that they do it  if you say they should release english content for their fans  by that logic they should do the same for other fans all over the world  obviously  that s not practical or feasible  if doing solely korean content means quality music and a genuine satisfaction for their creative drive  then that quality over language quantity is preferable for me  if they think doing all english songs detracts from their personal authenticity  then it does  i think it can be a matter of personal integrity and  whether we understand their reasoning or not  it matters to them  as fans we just have to accept that ,0,2152,366

magic shop   song details it s a fan song  jungkook wrote and helped produce the song    rm s verse there s a lot of references to past things rm s said  i e  everyone has their own galaxy   sea   one of joon s past tweets   namjoon and  sorta jk in extension through the rest of the song  references joon s last ment on the wings tour and that speech of his has always sort of hurt me lol  in the ment  he talks about how they ve gotten fan letters saying that while the fans are happy and proud that bts has gotten all these achievements  they feel as they haven t progressed in the same way and that sorta distresses them  joon then goes on to say how in the beginning  the members didn t think much of themselves  they didn t think they would achieve much at all  but then  here they are now  army is the one that saw that potential in them and gave them wings  i sort of understood it as  you gave us this ability to succeed  you also have that power within you to succeed  bts will try and support you through your endeavors  with our music and performances    and there s lines in the song where it seems to directly reference the ment   you saw us  you recognized us    you gave the best of me  you ll give you the best of you    and then the last line of his verse   you re the last reason as i stand at the edge of the abyss   it s sort of a dark line when i first read it  but as we now know contract negotiations were coming up and during one of the end of the year award shows jin mentioned how they considered disbanding  which is sort of a crazy thought  but considering how they really blew up in the us after ly  her  they must ve felt an incredible amount of pressure to get it right  and we know from jimin s recent log that he was feeling pretty down before ly  tear s comeback  he wondered why he was working so hard for and realized after watching a video of army singing  2 3   that  ah  this  this is the reason     suga s verse here  suga talks about how in the beginning he thought all he wanted to do was to succeed  but in the end he only wanted to comfort fans  and you can definitely see his growth from the august d mixtape to songs like paradise  i also sort of think it s interesting how this change in him is paralleling eminem s  who i believe is one of his favorite rappers    theories magic shop is also the name of a psychodramatic technique where the therapist shopkeeper barters with the individual in order to figure out what they truly need  this technique was shown in the first teaser for fake love in regards to the members  characters in the bu universe  the next muster is named magic shop  so it could be referencing how bts  music and performance is a sort of therapy  i m sort of interested in how the muster might add to the  lore  of the bu  the technique is also sort of in line with the whole message of the ly series  knowing yourself  respecting yourself  tl dr   there s a lot of layers to the song  the boys work hard for us  i m sad lol i sort of wonder if more people would like the song if it was structured more as a ballad or something  ,0,3100,582

sounds a bit like gatekeeping to me  anyway regardless of whether you consider him an army or not  i think it s important to have a viewpoint of someone who is not that deep into the fandom as well  like you said there are videos from other k army fans as well that can provide a viewpoint of someone who keeps up with all the drama so it s good to have another viewpoint who doesn t just it from the lens of someone who knows the drama  sometimes having too much info can also be misleading  for example  for idol i watched the dkdktv video which explained a lot of korean culture and idioms and wordplay and i also watched another video by a female fan who seems like she keeps up with drama because she picked up things like rm s face changing filters  apparently fans told him off to use filters  but didn t cover some other deeper symbolical stuff  it s never really good to stick to one viewpoint when trying to educate yourself in a matter  ,0,948,174

i would say trivia  love  i ll say it now  i m namjoon biased which probably heavily weighted my choice in song  i often feel like some lyrics or concepts seem to go over people s heads  why  there are many things i like about this song  from wordplay  to the feel  etc  but i ll emphasize on namjoon s more poetic and philosophical thought process  on the poetic side  rm saying knowing love is like knowing how your fingernails grow or that the way trees shed their leaves is very beautiful  the comparison of love to fingernail growth is saying that it s just something under your notice  until it becomes something you can t ignore anymore  that is what love is like to him  something that grows overtime to the point it demands your attention  with the tree lyrics  he s saying that love is natural  just like the seasons   but just like the seasons  love can be cyclical  your love can grow  plateau and fall  there could be cold winters  blooming springs  and sweltering summers  he s also saying that love is inevitable and with following how he defines love  not just romantic   anyone and everyone will feel it  i also like how he points out how similar love is to live in english and person in korean  to live is to love  and to love is to be human  fun fact  love is the same word as expensive for me  haha   ,0,1321,237

i found this video pretty good  but i m hesitant to take everything from this video at face value  just due to how complex jungian theory is  rather than a simple over identification with his rm persona  this is more of an acceptance of everything that kim namjoon encompasses  like in idol   there are hundreds of thousands of me   pointing out that he isnt just one thing   or identifying with one thing  also  with the different scenes and outfits in persona that wasn t just his idol persona  such as his rapper persona and leader persona  another thing to note that i found interesting was the verses that talked about  not enough to be         being said by his rapper persona   which is arguably one of namjoon s toughest times  where he really felt the need to show the world his worth  but then the leader persona at the podium confidently says   i just wanna go   i just wanna fly   being namjoon s most confident version of self ,0,940,167

true  i mean tear was more  down at the botton  dark and map of the soul for the intro is more confrontational  namjoon talks about his persona taking him but he sounds more like a natural thing that we all do  i believe that they will explore this feeling  something like agust d mixtape  there s a lot of saddness and anger ,0,326,61

it s funny with the btspop vs kpop thing  people who hate btspop don t even know that the funny term came from people  kicking  bts out from the kpop scene saying they forgot their korean roots and are  a western band  now  so armys started jokingly saying btspop  the sunmi thing proves how much people hate bts and not bc of armys  i feel bad for her  ,0,354,66

 other than bst  spring day and ly series  i need u prologue run epilogue i think anyone i introduce to the bangtan universe would be like  why are all these messed up things happening only to them   or  are there any good adults at all   or  do they have real jobs or school    this is mostly because in my country not going to college for education is not expected even if youre a bit lower middle class  where does jin get the money to drive around all day   but really i feel bu is a pretty accurate representation of things teenagers youngest go through  poverty  alcoholism  self harm  suicidal thoughts  abusive parents are things atleast 1 out of 7 teens go through  so yes  even if 7 7 have sufferings in the bu  it is a good representation of youth and hardships at the flower like bloom spring stage of lifes  and ofc the dynamic of friendship  and time travel just makes it more interesting  i honestly cant think of any artist kpop or american or anyone  had the vision to create an entire universe using a bit of their own personality experiences with fiction spanning over albums  most of all  the bu doesn t seem like they are going on a fluke and deciding things  seems planned and thought out  personal favourite is how the hyyh notes book had a bit of their real personalities in it too  my only complaining was that the female characters didn t have names or personalities  just plot devices  but then again  its bangtan s universe ,0,1452,251

good question  either something like ddaeng which allows you to discuss the genius lyrical wordplay within the song  or something like mic drop when yoongi stopped singing to prove they don t lipsynch  songs where they deliver clapbacks to haters are always fantastically delivered cause they never tweet back or mention it in interviews   instead they save it and add it all into their songs to show that yes  they do see it  but its all beneath them and within a song gives it so much more power then just a simple tweet response ,0,532,94

i m sure someone else has written about this better than me  but the neon vivid colors in the video and the obsession with the object of love in the lyrics along with other things give off the vibe of a very superficial and surface level feeling of obsession rather than true love  or like you are in a drugged state and experiencing things differently  and then with the following single fake love  that s when they realize everything before that is a lie  ,0,458,82

let me just list out everything as short as possible 1  kpop is asian  japan is an asian  therefore it isn t inauthentic to sing in japanese because it s still connected to whee they come from  english is a completely different thing  very seperate  2  if they did it everyone would start accusing them of betraying korea and selling out and becoming westernised  in fact this would just be more ammo 3  everyone has said this but kpop artists translate to japanese  the all do it its how they roll  4  pronunciation is a huge problem  they have a chinese song  one  why didn t they continue  because they don t speak chinese and from what i know chinese people barely knew what they were saying  if that happened now with english who even knows what would happen  5  they  and especially namjoon  would spend time on this rather than taking a well deserved rest  rm would have to translate korean songs into english in such a way that suits the beat  lyrics that he himself spent ages getting just right so that it sounds beautiful and perfect in both korean and translated in english  now he has to mess with that  or the actual beat  or do you want him to write a whole song from scratch  6  do you also expect them to translate write songs in the other 6 497 languages of the world  you know there are spanish army and indian army and thai army  on every tweet they tweet out i always see what i think is arabic army  what about them  7  they ve already sung fully english songs  rm has i think one on mono and a few other songs i can t remember  they ve covered songs like  someone like you  and jk sang  oh holy night  completely in english  and there s more  speaking of jk there s this song called  waste it on me  taht came out last year sung by jk  is all this seriously not enough  you guys want a whole official album  do you remember that the mic drop steve aoki remix s whole chorus was translated into english  ,0,1926,352

kim namjoon really knows how to talk well  that was such beautiful insight on what he was thinking about  it started off with his worried for the comeback but ended with his self love  he talked about how he was grateful the team is still there for another comeback and how he wished he could have participated in the melody aspect more but he s satisfied with working on the lyrics  namjoon is so much wiser than his age shows and it s such an attractive feature  what was he hospitalized for  and also  watching this log was like having a facetime conversation with him  he looks so breathtaking  wow  ,0,604,107

i would pick  on the start line  the other hidden track on 2 cool 4 skool and  sea   the 1st because it was the one that pulled me into bts and the interconnected theme of desert and sea in both songs  when i first heard sea i was like  ah this group still holds those values that they had in the beginning dear  and have become better versions of themselves but not changed who they are  i became a stan just b4 the lyh era and sea was kinda my reassurance that i picked a good group to stan   ,0,495,99

it s pretty easy to translate a song from korean into japanese and vice versa  i don t really know how to explain this well  but a lot vocabulary of the two languages is  shared  due to the influence from chinese  the japanese equivalent of a korean word will have very similar connotations and usages a lot of the time whereas the same can really not be said for the english equivalent  a lot of words also sound very similar   e g     and    used in bst  this happens a lot between french  english  etc  too due to latin roots except it s even more frequent for korean and japanese since there are fewer influences on the languages  both are made up of mainly  native  words and chinese  loan  words but now also some english western  loan  words for the modern language   the grammar is also almost identical and both are more or less the opposite to the way eurocentric languages like english are structured    since grammar and vocabulary wise the languages are very similar  translating a song into japanese from korean takes relatively little effort compared to the amount of effort it would take for english    you can literally do a direct translation and just adjust here and there where it sounds a bit awkward    so it s a pretty low effort job with the potential for a lot of profit    for the authenticity part  i think because you can more or less directly translate the korean into japanese  you can keep the meaning of the lyrics  it s not just the meaning but also other things too like the flow and feel of everything  i can read the japanese and korean lyrics for their songs and they  make sense  unlike many of the lines translated into english which just look extremely awkward  namjoon has been criticised by western journalists and whatnot for the way he phrases some of his english  i think this is because when he tries to say something longer and more complex  without prior planning unlike his un speech  he thinks in korean  directly translates and adjusts as he listens to himself  with japanese  even if he did the same  it would more or less come out sounding fine 90   of the time  i get what you re trying to say with the authenticity part with them not really being fluent in japanese  but because you can phrase yourself in very similar ways in korean and japanese  and because culturally the two countries share many more similarities  they lose far less of their original meaning when they make japanese versions of theirs songs so i think they still keep some  authenticity   ^ besides  even if it wasn t the case  the entire world s economy doesn t revolve around america  europe  etc  just like the western economy dgaf about catering to asian countries a lot of the time  asian countries don t have to for western countries  they re free to make songs in whatever language they like and not have to provide reasons or excuses for picking one language over another  ,0,2908,505

but namjoon speaks english fluently and they title a lot of their songs in english  put english everywhere really  sprinkle bits of english in their songs    i know japanese really well   i play games and read books in it at this point  and i studied korean a bit so i have an idea how similar different they are  and it s still a whole other language culture to learn  i don t think english being super different from korean more than japanese is a good argument here  also  i mean  the only reason why they release songs in japanese is not because of japanese being similar to korean  it s because there is so much yen to be made by going to japan cause the music industry is so big there  ,0,692,127
the big one i was waiting for dkdk to comment on was the dogs  pigs  pearls lyric  so interesting to learn about the traditional korean idioms  there could be a double triple entendre here too  it could also be a [pearls before swine reference]   from matthew 7 6 in jesus s sermon on the mount   do not give what is holy to the dogs  nor cast your pearls before swine  lest they trample them under their feet  and turn and tear you in pieces   i think this has the same meaning as the idiom  the strangeness of rewarding him  namjoon  for the celebrity persona of rm  when his true self  namjoon  doesn t understand what he s getting it for  another annotated [genius translation]   gets more political and says  the mention of dogs and pigs could be a reference to the the controversial comments made in mid 2016 by the head of korea s ministry of education s policy bureau  na hyang wook  he claimed that 99  of south korea s people could be treated  like dogs and pigs  because they had no ability to move up in the world  therefore were simply being fed and kept alive  this caused an uproar in south korea at the time and drew attention to the extremely classist and elitist structure of their government  this topic has also been addressed by bts in their song  am i wrong   off their 2016 wings album  by questioning whether he falls into this system or something else entirely  rm continues his own self reflection to discover his identity    have ears but don t listen have eyes but don t see fish live in all our hearts its name is selfish  selfish we re all dogs  pigs  become dogs because we re angry  tldr  namjoons sexy brain ,0,1641,286
i m suspecting the language s idioms and stuff are easier to translate since korean and japanese do have chinese influence and like how the most beautiful moment in life  hyyh  uses korean hanja  chinese text more or less  sometimes with different meaning but alot of times similar  actually has the same meaning in chinese  this is my thought though so don t take it too seriously  since i doubt i can speak their thoughts  ,0,425,72

tbh  i think that they sing in japanese kinda negates their argument about singing in english    they clearly only learned japanese and sing it because the japanese market is so big    i ve been studying japanese for years  can read books in japanese  etc  so i don t mind but  well  i guess if they don t want to sing in english they don t have it  ,0,350,63
when i watched this video  i also realized i had a very different first impression that did a 180 afterwards  and i can see why danny would predict a dark sounding album  i think there are a lot of visuals lyrics that kind of highlight the  darkness   like the namjoon figurines shattering at the end of the video and also words like  die  and  cry   since the song is all about the persona  or the outward mask  maybe the ending of the song is not an acceptance of the persona  but more like being defeated by the persona  kind of like how dna was about the very misleading honeymoon phase of a relationship  this song could also be namjoon putting on the rm mask and pretending that he wants to achieve more and be everyone s support  don t know if what i said made sense  still trying to gather my thoughts after watching the video  hahahaha,0,844,153

i m gonna cheat and pick two so i can talk about their interconnectedness but   road path   the hidden track from 2 cool 4 skool and   sea   the hidden track from ly h  i m sure i ve written before how much these tracks mean to me  road path being my favorite bts song of all time because it is  the  song that convinced me to stan bts back in 2013  i had never seen a kpop group make a hidden track before and i don t know if i d ever heard a kpop track be so    vulnerable  i m not saying they don t exist i just hadn t heard them   it is every fear of a rookie  every struggle they ve had to get there  and the strength they have created to make it where they are  debut  suga writes  i thought i was alone but i ve learned that we are seven   no longer barefoot  wearing shoes called bangtan   as an audience i can go back and hear that vulnerability from all those years ago every time i listen and it brings tears to my eyes each time  and what is so resonant now is that they had  no idea  what was heading their way and how much they would have to survive together and the heights they would reach  they had faced so many trials and finally were debuting and could not possibly foresee the depth and breadth of their coming trials  which brings me tooooooo sea their second ever hidden track 4 years after the first  and you can see suddenly  they have reached those insane heights  they rose through the ranks  the won daesangs  they had the weight of expectation on them  they were already reaching heights that no other kpop group  and few stars in the world have ever achieved  and the result is that they still have so many of those fears  and are now also shouldered with an incredible amount of pressure that in their rookie days was simply not the same  everything is heightened  everything is 10 fold  everything has been dialed up to 11  this track contains my favorite line of any bts song  where there is hope  there are trials   to me it speaks of that great weight they have found pushed upon themselves  when they debuted it was with a starry eyed hope that they might one day win a rookie award or a music show and now  it is the hope that they can influence their millions of followers and fans in a positive way  that they can bring joy and self reflection and remain authentic even when people are pulling them in all directions  and what is truly  truly  amazing is that sea was nowhere near their peak  they have surpassed every single record  every single expectation  all possible metrics in the year and a half following it s release  what i love about both these tracks is they are so tied to their deepest thoughts at the moment of recording  their fears  anxieties  and dreams  every time i listen to them i can hear those thoughts and also look back and know all of the success and difficulty they have had in the time between  every listen adds something new  every listen makes them more meaningful  road path has been in my rotation for 6 years and every single listen gives me something new to appreciate about how far they have come as artists  and as human beings  that is why they are my favorite bts songs  and the day they release another hidden track i m sure i ll add a new song to the  automatic tears  list that i already have   thank you for coming to my ted talk  ,0,3315,611
paradise there are certainly other songs i love more than this one  though this one is definitely in my top 20  the lyrics just spoke too true to me as a high school senior applying to college   i felt like i d been pigeonholed into chasing a very specific path in life that the other students in my school were also somewhat blindly chasing  i was constantly questioning what i wanted out of my life  and why i thought it was so important for me to  do well  when there were an infinite other methods to happiness  paradise s lyrics comforted me so much during these tense months  telling me the opposite of everyone else has been saying    it s alright to stop   theres s no need to run without even knowing the reason   it s alright to not have a dream   things ended up well for me but i still like to keep these lyrics in mind  i d talk about the above and the marxist theory that s related  because i m a sucker for philosophy  i think it s just a great song to share with people when they re in rough spirits and it really follow s bighit s motto   music for healing  ,0,1075,197

i think it s possible  our fan base has grown since last year and it s not a very competitive time for albums right now  the only thing which might be hard is that for streaming  we have to stream all tracks in the album for it to count because they track the dominant singles sales in relation to how well the other songs are doing  but if you look at it  out of most countries our streams are the ones that usually increase rather than decrease  it is so expensive  usually i just wouldn t but this time round i m so hype and yet i ll be missing most of the tracking days  i might as well make most of the sales i can to count  i mean the us army can t always be stealing all our thunder lol,0,693,136
none of them are fluent in japanese though and most of them can t really hold a good conversation in japanese  it doesn t matter if it s a kpop thing  can t say you want to be genuine and keep your identity then turn around and sing in a language you don t understand  it s not really genuine either singing japanese words they don t know ,0,339,61

either bs amp t or fake love dance practice for me personally  and for other people as well  the moment i fell in love with bts s dancing  was the moment i fell in love with bts  i think their choreography is something really special that most other idol groups can t compare too in terms of complexity and meaning  as time went on   and i watched more bts dance practices and such   i fell in love with jimin s dancing  something about how he hits each beat is so unreal and feels just amazing to watch  kind of euphoric   but what also had me fall in love with park jimin was a short clip of him backstage after a spring day concert  he was crying about his voice cracking during the performance and saying he wasn t good enough  even too this day  during an award ceremony he talked about how he will become a better singer  his commitment to becoming better  despite really being on top of the world  is something all other idols lack  so with that last paragraph i might change my answer to that clip  or perhaps if people are wondering why i like jimin so much specifically  that s what i d show ,0,1102,201

yes  for me  personally  i d prefer that bighit style him with the more adult look  he s closer to 30 than 20  i think people sometimes don t take jin as seriously as they should  and i think it s in part because he s often still styled as a teenager  just my opinion  of course ,0,279,52
there was a twitter thread a few weeks back where fans were sharing their floor seat experiences of jin s gaze  some of them said they even hid their faces because they couldn t handle his stare  others said the fans around them asked if they were okay afterwards  i ve said before that i would like to see jin styled more often with his bangs up  and not just because of a general thirst for foreheads or something   his browline and high forehead  when exposed  show the overall harmony of his face and the shape of his eyes  he looks more his age rather than as a teenager  at a few concerts and awards shows  when his bangs were styled up  or away from his face  he legitimately looked like a cover model or a perfect painting  i mean  look at this  [  i think bighit sometimes doesn t take the opportunity to show off jin s features like it should ,0,853,157
interesting  i also thought the  but namjoon  reference might be a coincidence  or at the very least not the main reference because 1  he talks about the three syllables of his name so he s talking about  but kim namjoon   while the fandom phrase is always just  but namjoon  and 2  it doesn t completely fit the lines immediately before and after  while dkdktv s interpretation is more coherent ,0,396,66

trivia  seesaw comes to mind  when i first watched burn the stage  something yoongi said about himself really stuck with me   compared to the other guys  i don t think i have a lot to show in terms of performance and dance   boiiiii you are so wrong       i d always thought he was a great performer anyway  in my eyes he has a balance of making dances look so chill and easy while still being able to have an aura of  imma chew you right up fam  and to hear him say that in an episode really affected me   i hope this perception of himself changed when he first performed seesaw because it has everything i love about him and more  his style of rapping  his meaningful lyrics  we even got a bit of singing and of course  the choreography no one was expecting  i think it s safe to say we all lost our minds when he started dancing in that sparkly red suit and the crowd was screaming so loud  and he just looks so happy performing seesaw and don t get me started on the smile on his face when he gets the crowd to sing along     this is just scratching the surface of my thoughts but i m so  so  so proud of yoongi and i hope he s proud of himself too  i had the pleasure of seeing seesaw live last year and it was just magical     ,0,1233,239

i have similar thoughts to this as well  but i think a lot of it has to do with how normalized and standard it is for people in the kpop industry to expand into the japanese market as the next step     which  again  doesn t really explain why japanese as a foreign language doesn t have the same concerns about authentic expression  but they have more people in the industry who can help them  know the insides of the music industry in japan  etc  and it isn t exactly the same for the american industry  that s about as far as i can rationalize it for myself    but yeah  i would also like to hear their thoughts about this    ,0,628,113

in my opinion  i m sure there is a balance between  this would look cool  army will love it  and in depth creative thinking  never forget that bang pd has a degree in aesthetics  which in my understanding is sort of philosophy and art theory combined  they also work with professional artists   their choreographers  mv directors  photographers  etc  maybe some of those people just mechanically go through the motions  but most artists want to understand the history and theory of their work   imo they re not artists if they don t have an understanding of their craft beyond the mechanical  i don t think the people making these decisions are just generic staff members  it also is totally plausible to me that they intended at least some of the effects mentioned in the article  as a former art history major  i think about effects and perception with everything around me  while i don t create  if i did i would be extremely intentional about creating effects that most people might only get subconsciously if at all  i don t necessarily think in jargon terms  but it s the ideas that matter  not the words used to express them  so given that i m able to think this way despite not being an artist or content creator myself  it makes perfect sense to me that the artists and artistic directors around bangtan would be intentional with the implementation of their concepts  ,0,1377,233
what really  for some reason my yt doesn t update and i m not seeing them trending  i really love this song though and i m happy they are getting this much attention from it  i hope they get bigger in aus  i won t be around first few days of tracking but maybe i can make up for it by picking up a physical from jb hifi even if it s expensive  honestly  i really think we can do number 1 this time,0,397,79
 gt  if the boys have enough power to make changes in jam packed schedule like around the bbma s then they definitely have enough control over their schedule in general be it concerts or other stuff  so trust it s funny how this is the exact thing i want to say  the boys have always been open about having a ridiculous amount of power over their schedules  we can even see it from how their staff interacts with them  for example  during burn the stage  when they realised that they would have to perform on a tiny stage at that american show  mr son wasn t like  we have to do it no matter what   instead  his tone was more like  why don t we just try it and make the most out of it  meaning at the end of the day  the boys have the power to say no  so the boys constantly mention that they make their own choices  their bosses say that they have always made their own schedule since predebut  they have been seen releasing stuff when they feel like it of course working around their pre existing schedule which they always mention having meetings about and again  the boys constantly explicitly tell us that the company does not force them to do anything  so where on earth did this narrative that they are puppets come from  and it s been so prominent this year  i just don t get it,0,1286,239

i mean they ve released songs in english  waste it on me  mic drop remix   so they  kinda  did it already  and i actually can foresee them doing something similar to that ilin the future  thru a collab   but i totally get why they don t wanna do a full english album  i mean    the way their lyrics are super complicated and poetic in korean might not translate as freely or as nicely as it does in korean  plus don t fix something that isn t broke you know  they already incorporate some english in their songs already  so i dunno  it just makes me annoyed that ppl want to  force  them to release and english album  if they feel it s inauthentic and they feel uncomfortable doing it  that should be reason enough to just let it go and not ask anymore  i keep seeing this japanese argument  and i get why ppl bring it up cuz they did release japanese songs albums and that s technically in another language   but kpop has always had that relationship with japan so it s not just them that s done this in the past  the west is new territory  let bts and bighit figure it out  and just support them as a  fan   ppl sometimes forget to know their place  we aren t managers and we aren t working in bighit  just let them do their thing  it s working and they re happy  like i said  i wouldn t be surprised if in the future they release a single in english thru a collab like they ve done before  example is that jason derulo song shut up and dance with lay and n,0,1459,266
it s really a kpop thing to release japanese versions of their songs or occasionally new japanese songs  sometimes chinese too  though bts only has 1 chinese song  i m pretty sure this is generally a thing the company pushes for since the japanese music industry is so big  overall bts as a group are better at speaking understanding japanese than english  namjoon aside  ,0,372,61

i ve always been a bts only stan and only lately started going on other more general kpop communities  and it s crazy how kpop fans despise bts and armys and then spin it around to say we re the toxic ones  i m actually shocked by how much they really hate us  not just in silly fandom fights  but hate us for real  there s a lot of debate on the btspop vs kpop thing  and how armys often think we re superior and in a league of our own  and honestly  after being downvoted for everything i posted defending praising bts in the unpopular opinions sub  someone who said that bts doesn t write their own music got 10 upvotes  my reply saying the truth is in the negatives    lol   i finally understand why some armys distance themselves and bts from kpop  kpop stans  particularly 2nd gen stans who can t seem to accept that their faves didn t pave the way for bts  are so toxic and hateful towards us and bts and anyone that supports bts  i feel so bad for sunmi right now  armys really are the best fandom,0,1005,183

whether japanese is similar or not really isn t the point though  the two languages may be similar but they are still two different languages  at the end of the day none of bts speak japanese fluently but still produce songs in japanese  if they say that it is inauthentic to sing songs in english  a language they don t speak  why isn t it inauthentic to sing songs in japanese  a language they also don t speak  i ll like to hear what they have to say about that ,0,465,85

i have a lot of feelings about this  english as a language has been almost forced upon many other countries through distribution of culture with very little room for other languages and cultures in english speaking countries  in the rare case that other cultures and languages are highlighted in english speaking countries  they are usually pigeon holed as novelties or  others  with little to no distinction between the  others   probably the most popular example of this controversy is shakira being chosen to sing the world cup anthem for south africa  despite being colombian  bts s identity is linked with their language  and their language is linked with their culture  the more people are exposed to it  the less likely they are to be pigeon holed  and the more likely it is that the  english vs  others  dichotomy will start to fall apart  tl dr  good  i m glad   ,0,872,142

exactly  songs don t do particularly well but albums can  that s from fandom power  like seventeen was selling great in japan before they ever started making japanese music  but i ve been following kpop long enough to know that the hallyu wave in japan was dead up until recently and japan was mostly tired of korean singers even though they were singing in japenese  even boa had a couple of rough years there in terms of sales  japan and korea still have tons of political tension  so when bts still sings in japenese  i wonder if it s because of that conflict because when it comes to america and subsequently everywhere else besides japan  they are very adamant on being authentically korean ,0,696,119

first jimin than hobi  now joon    all of these logs make me both happy and sad  okay so another rough translation  which i hope is helpful   amp  x200b  joon says this album  ly  tear  was difficult to make  he started four days after getting discharged from the hospital  and he mainly worked on the lyrics    a lot of things happened but joon s proud to have been able to work on the album  it would have been nice if he had participated more with the melodies but he s satisfied with the work he put in for lyrics  this album  ly  tear  is abour sadness  and joon thinks the album making went well because he used his own experiences with sadness  joon says sadness isn t just  sadness   he s talking about sadness having multiple perspectives  amp  aspects   so it was nice to work on it  in the beginning he had a hard time conceptualizing  of how to make the album    a lot of things happened  but he thinks they were able to make a great album again because of the other members  efforts and their contribution to the team  joon really likes 134340 and paradise  he believes  without doubt  that if he believes in himself and improves himself there will be an answer  there s a lot of things that make him happy  members  family  army  clothes  figures  cafes  parks  nature  etc  and joon hopes to treasure all of them and fill his life with those things  he wants to say to himself  you re doing good  and you ll do good  don t doubt youself  kim namjoon fighting  he also talks about preparing for billboard  and that he won t forget he s speaking on behalf of bts  he ll maintain a positive outlook  they say there s 2 ways of changing the world  first being a revolutionary and second looking at the world with positive outlook  joon wants to do both  people say he doesn t have to do everything  but joon wants to hold on to what he has and live trying hard  he says to himself  i think i m living well  with these thoughts and concerns  i love you  kim namjoon ,0,1976,351

um i don t think so  twice criticized by right wingers there a lot after singing in korean on music station which is sad  plus  as far as i know  warner music japan have massively invested on twice and been agreesively promoting them in japan  thus  twice have released tons of japanese songs  including japanese original songs  way more than bts meanwhile bts have only released few yet still the majority of japanese armys prefer korean versions than japanese ones because they can t hide the accents  btw i honestly don t think most armys would be in favor of releasing english version either to reach the gp to take the top spot on the charts as bts said in their recent interview ,0,685,120

oh you re definitely right  it s just everytime i read their answers to the english question  their answers are very patriotic to me  i really like the comparison some armys have used in that ever since their success in america  korea treats them like olympic athletes representing korea  and you can see that they themselves are proud that as koreans and asians they are breaking these records and boundaries  and they are willing to see how far that goes even if that means never getting that  1 song on hot 100  they still want to take that chance  so that s why i m curious to know if they would do the same in japan if they could  because they currently treat these two industries completely different ,0,707,124

korean labels see japan as the place to make easy money     japanese fans buy cds and merch just as much as korean fans  unlike western fans who are not used to spend money for these    there s a stronger concert going culture than in korea   even relatively small groups can earn a living by touring in japan   it s very close geographically so no big logistics involved to promote there   while there are some cultural differences  general mentality is pretty similar  which helps a ton with the business aspect because of this most korean idols will try their chance in japan at some point  be they successful or not  and let s be fair some korean groups make more money in japan than in korea  especially nugu groups  so whatever their success in the west i m pretty sure bighit would have debuted bts in japan anyway  because of the quicker roi ,0,850,154

your comment makes me feel understood  thank you  i was probably exaggerating a bit when i imagined that probably their only consideration was whether armys would think it looks cool  however  it makes some sort of common sense to me  keeping in mind that common sense can be wrong       that they might have considered how the visual symbolism would play into the lyrics of the song and or some broader concept such as destiny or loss of control  but i just cannot imagine the director and choreographers considering the embodiment of the subjectivity of the controlling gaze of the whatever ,0,593,101

yeah i m not implying they shouldn t sing in japanese but k pop groups have and can make money in japan with touring just their korean discography but companies want their groups to get that boa money  that tvxq money  that kara money  y know  but after they won their first bbma  big hit used that to their advantage in japan  something like them even performing on music station wouldn t have happened if america wasn t calling them the biggest boyband in the world because they didn t have a hit song with the general japanese public  so if they had  broken  into america first  would they be able to break that barrier of being able to be successful with the korean music everywhere including japan  i mean gangnam style was a hit everywhere in the world except japan and that mostly comes down to politics  so i was just throwing out those questions into the void because i find it interesting  it s also why i find twice s success in japan super interesting too  they were the first and only korean artist to every sing in korean on music station ,0,1053,185

he knew about  but namjoon  he mentioned that in comments section and he said its not that simple and simply put not in same realm of the song  like song is way above that hate comment  its more of internal reflection part where namjoon sometimes disagrees with rm ways  they both are experienced and love and respect bts genuinely  david is army  and danny being the guy he is never said or mentioned if he is or not but rm and bts them  being an army you can see the hardships they went in their carrier but they are more then the public image of them and memes  it was well put double meaning act where it aligned with  but namjoon  thing and its just wordplay which is something rm uses a lot  i ma not questioning your opinion but as a song it doesn t fit very well if its main reason behind that line ,0,807,155

that intro with explaining carl jung s theory really helped shed light on the topic  their interpretation of the song is a little bit different than what i first interpreted it to be  but i m super curious if his prediction about this upcoming album being dark will become true  danny keeps talking about how rm is taking up too much of who is namjoon which makes namjoon confused as to who he really is  but it seems like at the end of the song  namjoon knows and is okay that he is going in the direction of rm  he s okay to be labeled as rm the idol  but i m not sure if that means he has to give up the shadow of namjoon or that as long as he knows his shadow is always there to remind him he is namjoon  then it is okay  hmmm ,0,731,145

so namjoons jacket says to not pay attention to the man behind the curtain  i keep thinking of jin in that context in this universe  that coupled with the way they have the on standing out in the new theme  which makes me think maybe jin is watching one of his homemade mvs or one of them in another reality  can t help but think that the namjoon in front of the curtains in the mv  wants us   the rest of them to ignore reality and keep living the lie  kinda like in inception when the people are constantly dreaming  as those worlds are more real and dear to them than the real world  maybe jin didn t fix things and this is fake or him looking back one everything with rose tinted glasses  idk  lol but the best thing about their universe is that you can endlessly speculate ,0,778,148

this is all such interesting and endearing stuff   gt yoongi said that personally  the credits that can be seen externally  who contributed more  the credits  or who holds more rights  etc  yoongi doesn t pay much attention to such things because  music is not only about what is visible to the eye  that things from behind the scenes such as the discussions that happen  the process of making the sound  each and every one of these decisions although not visible on paper  all come together to become good music   if i can play a part in this  that s enough for me  regardless of how many parts i get or how much rap goes in compared to the past  rather than such things  i would just like to focus on making good music   i wish i could beam this to the mind of every army  the line distribution or even the credits are never the whole truth  their contributions and system of making music and performances is more organic than that  he seemed to be pretty enamoured by everything yoongi had to say in general  which is the fate of every interviewer everywhere  yoongi s thoughts are always fascinating  kim noting how he was so frank it even felt difficult to publish   that s not a thing you hear about an idol too often  hehe   gt but kim says seokjin s gaze was really intense  seokjin sat directly across from him  and apparently seokjin  with the gazehe has when he s speaking or doing ments at concerts  gazed at kim for the 30 40 minutes  continuously  so he felt a bit  flustered   he said this 3 times lol   no  he didn t wink    is his expression usually like that  a very intense one   he says they exchanged a lot of words but he remembers the intense gaze the most   he did not do a hand kiss either  understandable  i didn t have big  wow is this what he is like irl  experiences about any of them when i saw them at the concerts  but seokjin did catch me off guard with his intensity  i still remember the moments when he stood at the edge of the stage and stared in my general direction for a few seconds  and how intense he looked   being exposed to that in a room for 30 40 minutes must really be something   gt what was most memorable of what hoseok said to kim  lately  he truly recognized the importance of communication  to speak and express himself   in the past  i hadn t thought deeply about these things and he regrets them  and he posted on fancafe around this time  hoseok felt really sorry that although he is aware that you must express and speak constantly to understand one another s feelings  it s often difficult to say so  hoseok said this to kim with hopes to deliver this to the fans  which is why kim is telling this message to us  kim said hoseok is very well aware of his gratefulness for the fans and emphasized that he will communicate with fans  hoseok also said that no matter how much bts succeds and as bts grows and reaches higher peaks  all the more  he will communicate even more with the fans and will express his gratefulness to the fans  i have a lot of thoughts about this  but ironically struggle to express them  the importance of communication is something he has talked more and more about the past year or two  and an effort that has not gone unnoticed  being unable to fully convey the depth of gratitude is relatable  honestly i ll just end up copy pasting the entire thing if i continue to pick out especially interesting stuff  it s all really good and endearing  jimin and jungkook talking about how none of the members compete with each other  and they have no qualms about asking for help  namjoon being the thoughtful leader he is and giving credit for tear s success to the vocal line s evolution  the way this critic talks about this group and its members like he really wants us to have faith in them   and then literally saying just that  it s like validation ,0,3832,686

the thing i never understood is  don t kpop boy groups do infinitely more to break gender norms and expectations than ggs do  kpop boygroups are pretty much completely turning gender norms upside down in a lot of different areas  it s completely unfamiliar and visibly alienates people  and every time we push back against those derogatory comments about bts that we hear every day from our peers  media  etc we re actually subverting the current system around gender  why would feminists be against that  isn t one of the main fights of feminism about upending gender expectations and roles ,0,592,96
always proud of them and the way they articulate themselves  but i am saddened to an extent  that this needed to be said and said again  i think for the third time  that they don t plan for it and want to express themselves in their own language  it s time for the  fans  who harass them to stop  or move on to another group  ,0,326,63

it s not traditional fondant  which i ve never worked with  but something called marshmallow fondant  it s meant to serve a similar purpose but taste better than the standard kind does  yeah  i agree with your thoughts because i know i didn t actually knead it quite as long as the recipe said  but it looked right  and felt right  going by comparison with video tutorial  so i thought i could take the lazy way out hah hah next time i would knead it longer  have it cooler in the house and get it put together more quickly so it didn t dry out as much  thanks for your comment   ,0,580,107

so my best friend definitely is army and v is her favorite  she has been accumulating a few items which feature tata  i wanted to surprise her with a bts theme cake for her birthday  i already had the heart shape baking pan  so it was an easy start to this idea  cake is just a chocolate cake mix which i frosted the edges and top of to make the decorations stick  red part is marshmallow fondant  tutorial and recipe for which i found online  it was really easy to make and seemed to work out well for this purpose  in the future i would work with it quicker as when it warmed up  it tended to droop off of the sides of the cake and slip downward  also  it kind of dried out as i worked with it  as you can see by the texture on the top of the design  had to patch it in a couple of places  it was my first try at using marshmallow fondant and i enjoyed working with it  i think that it really has potential and i have offered to make a cake of cooky for her son s 10th birthday in june  her other son likes shooky   i have pretty much beginner level cake decorating skills  this friend is the one who initiated me into the wonderful world of bts by dragging me with her to see the bts world tour love yourself in seoul just a few short months ago  i wanted to do something meaningful to mark that along with the occasion of her birthday  i kept it a complete surprise until i unveiled it to her and i think she was really surprised and truly loved it   ,0,1455,286

this is a very important topic bts is discussing that is hardly ever addressed and is always swept under the rug by somebody or any country s society itself  in the past  i have been many times vocal or have  let out  a mental illness i suffer from and i do note when speaking about it when i tell others of it that one would never notice that i have it because the medication i take for it works so well for me concerning it and masks it almost completely  this admittance of this truth of mine is usually positive because i am a friendly person in general and am open to discussing my mental health condition to anyone who is interested in hearing and learning more about it and how it mat affect me if that question does come up  but some people do see it as a negative thing because of hollywood s or the media s portrayal of it or ignorance about mental illness and mental health in general shared by other people or in most society s that exist in the world today sadly  i think it s pretty important to be vocal about mental illness and even depression because as i mentioned earlier  hollywood and television media usually make people with depression or people suffering from mental illness to be monsters  crazy  freaks  and what not which is absolutely terrible and is not doing the people who suffer from these conditions any favors  and when people watch this stuff  they  learn  about this ignorance surrounding mental illness and mental health in the entertainment they consume and think what must be on the screen is true about mental health or a said mental illness when it is not  it s really sad and it s not going to end any time soon i am afraid      but it is always wonderful to hear of other famous people such as the members of bts talk about mental health and achknoledge that it is not something to be ashamed of  but that it affects many people all over the world and there is always help for anyone suffering from these conditions if they need it  thank you again to bts for bringing up this very important topic ,0,2041,372

i think a lot of people are just scoping out the market right now and waiting for ticket prices to drop  as am i  i m planning on going to both days and actually have my sunday ticket  but both my siblings do not and will probably wait till very last minute to make a purchase  luckily  we got great tickets for day one so we re not too picky about day two  i wouldn t worry too much  i think when fans don t get the seats that they want that they will eventually settle  plus  the tickets that are available all seem to be nosebleeds and there are maybe a few hundred left  a few hundred may seem like a lot but considering the capacity  it doesn t seem all that terrible to me  i highly doubt that the stadiums are going to be half empty  in fact  i can imagine a lot of people who are only planning on going to one show impulsively buying tickets to day two  haha  ,0,868,168

this  i appreciate this so much  it is very hard to speak out about mental health issues  let alone acknowledge your personal struggles in front of millions  not only have yoongi and namjoon shared their personal journeys through songs like the last and always  but the overall message of embracing your mistakes  growing  and taking care of  loving  yourself in bts  music resonates on a personal level  these things that they are talking about are so relate able  no matter the age  that it makes you feel like you are not alone  and there is a way to make things better  not only that  seeing what bts has accomplished serves as a hopeful reminder that even though you may be going through a hard time or struggling  there is a way to find strength  push through and achieve or work on things that matter to you  also  i am so glad yoongi talked about treating depression  mental health as a medical condition  i think non stigmatized awareness is very important  and hopefully it can encourage more people to seek out professional help  sorry for the rambling  just a few thoughts i wanted to share ,0,1103,192

for second gen stans  to acknowledge bts as the  way pavers  is to take away status from their own groups artists  to diminish their role  for 3rd gen stans  to acknowledge bts means to say that there faves successes and future successes were reliant on bts  they prefer to say 2nd gen groups are the reason bts is where they are because otherwise they have to admit that bts just just a spectacular group and is better than the rest of kpop  i m not saying any of these conclusions are true  but that s how they think  giving bangtan credit to them is like taking away every other groups  merits  it s pride ,0,609,110
so  i m not a humanities person  and a lot of the jargon eludes me too  but i am an academic  so maybe i can help weight in on a couple of your questions  \[and this turned into a mini essay  sorrrryyy\] first of all  it s helpful to detach  intent  and  effect   so the author need not know about a choreographers directors  intentions  to talk about the symbolic  effects  of a stage  if you take a look at this sentence   gt in the  e  concept photos for  love yourself       answer   bts are depicted as marionettes  whose broken bodies can only be kept upright by ribbon  desubjectifying the members and constructing them as passive objects of the \[male\] controlling gaze  the author  doesn t  state that the creative team behind the performance are having conversations like   hey  let s create a mise en abyme in which the members shall be passive objects of the male controlling gaze in order to embody of their alienation   but they are claiming that the way they are depicted has the  effect  of desubjectifying the members  etc  this point is itself debatable  why is the controlling gaze male  idgi    but  it makes sense to me that if you have a performer posed like a marionette  a message is being communicated that the performer s  persona  lacks agency in that moment  but even though the directors might not be going around saying  let s use mise en abyme to portray the members as passive objects etc   i think we can also assume that some of this effect is still intentional  even if it wasn t articulated in the same jargon used by the author  i think we can agree that there is more thought put into the symbolism of these stages beyond   wow  this will look cool   as for why the author uses terms like  mise en abyme  and  desubjectification     well  it definitely makes this piece pretty inaccessible  so it makes me question who the intended audience for this piece is  but jargon in any field is used as a helpful shorthand to identify any concept idea method  for those also entrenched in the field  it s also a way to connect your ideas to others  ideas  by using the term  subjectivity   the author is on some level inserting their ideas into an existing conversation body of literature that uses the same terminology      this was not intended to turn into a whole ass essay  but apparently you can t take the academia out of the academic ,0,2373,399
i really hope more non fans read this article  it really helps to convey what so many of us treasure and respect so much about them  i just have so much respect for all the boys  i treasure namjoon and yoongi so much  its honestly scary trying to be open about yourself  and for them in their position  you just know there s people waiting to twist their words  the way they are always so raw and normalise mh means so much to me  they are so incredibly strong to do so and they always give me so much comfort and reassurance  they really have been the only people in my life that have openly talked about and normalised mh in a positive light  it means so much to me as someone from a background and culture where it is so stigmatised and taboo ,0,746,142

i haven t listened to this episode yet but i m a regular listener of popcast  if you liked this episode they also discussed k pop in two separate episodes  one in august    2017 and one soon after mono  came out last year  the episode last year was like half bts i think  one thing i ve always appreciated from the host  jon caramanica  is how seriously he takes k pop  i think there s always a tendency in the states to gawk at bts and other k pop groups in the same vein that americans would make weirded out jokes about other  oriental  shit  but caramanica really just talks about their music and their production process as he would for any american artist  would highly recommend both episodes ,0,700,121
i think you re taking a very narrow minded view of what a company does and what bighit does  apart from bang pd himself being very versed in a multitude of things  they ve got staff hired for all of this  with their individual expertises to make the bts experience a rich one and not just   hey he s look pretty to fans  let s do this   a very small example of this would be all black hair  army had been asking for it for years but they didn t and don t just give us what we may be asking for  they did only when it met their concept  you don t go creation a whole universe without having people capable of creating it and these stages to go with them ,0,653,125

 when i heard about the launch of new trl i thought it would be a home for k pop  yeah same  lmao i remember the thread we had about it here  i really thought there was an opportunity there for new trl to harness the power of kpop fanbases for their ratings and views while providing a  mainstream  space for them and that it could be a mutually beneficial situation    seems funny and naive in retrospect   new trl sucked and did terribly and bts s popularity was growing so much that it was clear they would have nothing to gain from going on the show ,0,554,104

unsolicited i told a coworker that i used to cut myself because of depression  how depression is not about feeling sad but wanting to feel something  but i did it with a straight face with no emotions  i tried to say it plainly as possible to make a point that this is a fact about my life and what i think this other patient is feeling  i work in healthcare   one would think i would say that to seek attention to myself so that i can be comforted  but that s not what i was trying to do  i was simply trying to normalize depression to make a point that  it s okay to talk about this   my point is i m a noona to bts yet it s because of them that i can feel so comfortable talking about depression  forever i ve been wanting to look up to someone  a celebrity  and have them do what i truly want a celebrity to do which is help their fans and inspire  they are helping me in so many ways ,0,889,175

 gt  they express themselves much better in korean  man  there s a real art to writing a good song where the lyrics blend seamlessly with the melody and the beat to make the overall song aurally satisfying but still convey the meaning you re aiming at  there are places where a word in a different language  fits  better  like i m thinking about  bapsae  which expresses a korean idiom using a blend of korean and a partially english chorus because  they call me bapsae  fits better with the beat than if you said it in korean  and  chase em  fits the rhyming structure and meaning right were you need it to  i love that they blend languages to find the best words for the lyric and it makes me happy to see plenty of artists  including western artists  doing the same  in short  op  let the songwriters be songwriters  they ll choose which language is best to express an artistic feeling and match the melody   beat  translations  with rare exception  will  never  be as good as the original  and songs  forcibly  written all in another language can feel  well   forced  or like they re missing something  ,0,1107,192

never listened to this podcast before but the discussion throughout is pretty interesting  i like their wrap up discussion about how groups  like brockhampton  are increasingly accepting the label  boy band  rather than rejecting it  signaling a subversion of the narrative around boy bands  seems parallel to rm s quote in yesterday s ew article   but if they want to call us a boy band  then we re a boy band  if they want to call us a boy group  we re a boy group  if they want to call us k pop  then we re cool with k pop  ,0,527,92

i will be forever grateful of them  especially yoongi and namjoon they make think deeper about myself and my mental health  i have always listen mostly alternative indie rock in my early teens and always feel connected with the pain or anger in the music because it made me feel less alone in some ways  now that i am older and i found them i appreciate the fact that their music reflex their pain and hardships but they always give up hope above all  they truly gave me confort in a time when i need them most so   forever  ,0,525,99

so  so true  we re honestly so lucky that he decided to stick with the trainee life  he s such a conceptual genius and i remember also reading that bang pd nim got some inspiration for the bu storyline from yoongi discussing his inhibitions about adulthood  leaving dreams in childhood  etc  and to have a creative genius that isn t craving screen time or more song lines     he s a music ceo s dream  it just goes to show that every single member is intrinsic to bts s identity  i think a lot of new fans  especially western ones  are predisposed to thinking boy girl groups have key members and  throwaway  members  and that just doesn t apply to bts ,0,653,111
i couldn t agree more  he was really careful wasn t he  and i appreciated that as well  what is exactly right for one person may not be right for another so highlight the need to address an issue  highlight and normalize the fact that it is a real and important issue  but don t be arrogant enough to think that your answer is the only one  don t be tightly prescriptive about how everyone should handle it  i thought that showed  very clearly  that they want to use the platform but are thinking very carefully and responsibly to make sure that they don t misuse it  that s also a level above the norm ,0,603,109

definitely yoongi  he s gotten so much more comfortable with being open on camera and yet there s still these old stereotypes circulating about him that might affect the way he s perceived  especially by new army  for example  he s written some of the most vulnerable  tender  pure love songs  but a lot of people would never guess that about him by just a surface judgment  then  aside from yoongi i would actually say tae and hobi  they re both very extroverted and i think a lot of people mistake this social openness as a whole expression of who they are  i actually think they are among the most mysterious members of bts in terms of how they think  what they want  etc ,0,675,119

you know     it strikes me as obvious that celebrities should know what power and influence they have and use it for good  but unfortunately that isn t the case and i m always so amazed that bts seem to take the concept so seriously  they are keenly aware that they have a platform  and they try as much as they can to use it well  i stan the right people  i also think that what namjoon is talking about  how broadly applicable the  love yourself  message is  is key to understanding bts  ethos as a group  i ve seen a lot of people deride  love yourself  as being a shallow and cliche message  but i think it s just indicative of how conscientious they are  as namjoon said  they know they have a wide audience  and they can t in good conscience give any  advice  because they know their outlook and experiences are limited  for example  telling one person to  just cheer up and work hard  might be what they need to hear  but for many others  especially those with depression or those on the receiving end of systemic issues like poverty or prejudice  it s insulting and damaging   love yourself  applies to everyone  ,0,1121,197

yoongi is a brave  determined  compassionate soul  and namjoon s quote reminds me so much of his lyrics from reflection  wings   rm elaborates   that s why we have the concept love yourself  we don t want to preach  do this or don t do that   because that s not the way that we want to spread our message  like for example  say  anna from new york or marc from rio or me or you  we have different looks  different races  different parents and backgrounds  different weather  whatever  everything s different    we re born with different lives   he continues   but you cannot choose some things  so we thought that love  the real meaning of it  starts with loving ourselves and accepting some ironies and some destinies that we have from the very start  but we never chose that  so instead of preaching or \[giving\] orders  that s why we committed to loving yourself and that s why i started with  i m just an ordinary boy from city near seoul in south korea  at our u n  speech   [ ,0,983,167

welcome new army  whenever someone from some other group did something problematic and were called out on it  people of that fandom would deflect and say  but namjoon did this      or  but namjoon did that     as if their faves should not be held accountable because namjoon already made mistakes before they did  what these people fail to realize or acknowledge is that namjoon has apologized and educated himself and has grown and matured into the person he is today  this part of the song shows how namjoon was aware of all this  but namjoon  bs happening on the internet but it doesn t bother him anymore    yes  his mistakes are part of him but also look at him now ,0,671,118
your own examples disprove your point  if singing in english well  for mass radio play  were so easy  every member would have sung on wiom  they didn t  for a reason  bts and bighit aren t stupid  they ve done very well for kpop  better than anybody else  and it s not because they don t know what they re doing or don t challenge themselves  maybe they will make a conscious decision to record another song or two in english in the future  but i would not say their doing so would be a result of avoiding  hypocrisy  or past  klutziness   it would be because they believe they had reached the point to where they can do it well and it s the right sound for the song ,0,667,121

 my comment stands  means i still hold that opinion  and obviously westerners are forgiving of koreans performing in english  given your example of two bts songs  waste it on me and        i m not sure how to take your question about bts not being interested in non english markets  i don t recall saying this  but perhaps something i wrote could be interpreted that way  as for learning english to sing there s a difference between learning song lyrics and learning an entire language  jungkook does it all the time for his english covers  and that s as an extra curricular activity  absolutely the korean language and culture deserves the same respect as any other culture  asking why bts can t do one song in english when they do entire albums in japanese is not to disparage korean culture  nor does it disregard the band s workload  it questions the disconnect between their goals and their approach to solving the problem of cracking the u s  singles market  look at it this way  it s the question that any good manager would ask in that situation  ,0,1055,177

personally i think there s no point to it if it s not up to their usual standard and i hope they would agree  for example what s the point of having rappers like suga and j hope if you re going to handicap them by making them rap in english  mic drop remix was the most that they ve leaned into english for a group song and what happened was that the fans thought the lyrics were cringy and bad  and the locals could barely tell that it was english or what the lyrics were  i thought fake love and idol had a really good balance korean lyrics and english lyrics for the english speaking audience to grab onto while still keeping it comfortable for the members to perform  in general i don t think english songs from kpop groups are the game changer people seem to think they are   the only group that i could see doing it successfully rn is blackpink and that s because it would feel authentic to  them  as a group  not so much for bts ,0,936,174

this is exactly what i was gonna say  reminds me of a comment i saw from a spanish speaking artist once   gt when asked about the possibility of recording an album in english  juanes responded   singing in spanish is very important because it s the language in which i think and feel  i respect people that sing in english  but for now i ll keep my spanish   they probably feel more comfortable expressing themselves in japanese  and english is much harder to rhyme flow in compared to japanese  so they re stuck with very limited options to make it fit the song s rhythm  even more closely related languages like german or spanish end up with wildly different lyrics in english just to force the words to rhyme  fit the line length  and not sound too awkward ,0,760,130

i mean i think it is very simple  they want to succeed  but not if it makes them feel as if they are losing their identity in the process  clearly for them singing in japanese does not make them feel this way  but singing in english would  i don t see anything wrong with that  they still feel like bangtan when they sing in japanese  probably because the countries are so closely intertwined in both language and culture  however they feel like they are being shoved into a mold that doesn t fit them if they try to sing  rapping is probably their main concern  in english  i respect that and don t have an issue with it  japanese and english really can t be compared  imagine if a french artist sang in english compared to singing in korean  not comparable  ,0,760,137

 bts doesn t have to do anything different to break into the us market  they already have  and they know that with the support of army they will succeed whether they sing in english or not  and again  bts is korean  they sing in korean  namjoon has already said that they won t sing in english because not only is he the only one who knows it  but english is a hard language  they record in japanese because of the korean artist formula  japan is a good way to break out to the rest of asia  waste it on me was like a nod to english speaking armys and the western world  at this point it seems like a lot of ignorance on your part  bts doesn t have to do anything we want  why not let them sing in their native language and spread korean culture into the us  it s not like america won t listen to songs that they can t understand  ,0,831,159

first of all  let me apologize to you for causing you upset  wasn t my intention  although if you take another look at what i said  i was trying to convey that their position could be  interpreted  as racist  but i think they are much too well meaning to do that  obviously that wasn t entirely clear  and i think it s great that they are representing their pride in their country  i live in a very diverse part of the u s  and one of things that i love about my country is that we are such a mixed bag  that gives us avocado toast and korean tacos  mariachi music and oud records  southern rock and kpop  but bts said they wanted to succeed in the us market  and they will record japanese albums  but not a single english song  i m questioning the hypocrisy  nothing else ,0,773,141
yessssss  i see it too  ,0,24,6
no  your comment does not stand  because as was already explained  japanese fans are understanding of korean singers having less than perfect japanese  again  do you think westerners would be so forgiving of korean singers performing in english  and again  they already did two songs in english  one of them had unclear pronunciation  so what you are proposing is multiple songs  in english   with unclear pronunciation  and do you really think bts is not interested on non english markets  given their touring locations over the years and the huge fanbases in non english speaking countries  they are interested  they are simply not superhuman  you are saying they must learn japanese  learn english  and sing them well  and learn choreography  write songs  produce  film shows  eat  sleep  work with other artists  promote  do photo shoots  do musters  do festa  travel  perform concerts  and have some semblance of personal lives  for what  in all seriousness  your comment makes me angry  the korean language and their culture has just as much worth and deserving of acceptance around the world as english  bts is not required to sublimate or backseat their language to  prove  they re not some fabricated definition of  hypocrites   ,0,1238,192

even if you deleted your post  you re still going to get this notice hopefully  anyway  whoever you are  we all hope you deleted it not because of the backlash but because you re embarrassed for posting something like that and have learned from it  do not say that bts is only marketing for the us now  because they aren t  don t throw around the word  racist  casually like that anymore either  and if you still don t understand why your post is hurtful and harmful to not only bts but also armys  then you are just being ignorant  i genuinely hope that s not the case  and that you have learned something today  ,0,614,109
 please note  i didn t say they are racist  i said awkwardly  i admit that i would suspect them of such if they weren t the adorkable puppies they are  and bts already promotes to the entire world  they are a global band  i m not suggesting they sing in all english  all the time  just one song in english on an entire album  that would largely market itself ,0,359,63

the question is really more about hypocrisy  and bts are trying to be global superstars  they \ want\  greater success in the us  i don t think everything is about the western world  but i think it s valid to ask why it s not hypocritical to record in one market specific language and not another  and  waste it on me  just makes the hypocritical question more important  bts has recorded in english once already why ow are they saying they won t  it s inconsistent ,0,466,79

honestly  as a korean american who has seen a lot of casual racism and rejection of asians from western entertainment world  your post really hurt  bts being racist for wanting to promote korea and their language to a market that has locked asians out    really ,0,262,45
i think the large part you re missing is that japan and korea are culturally similar  so it s way easier for a korean act to get into japan  also given their history of the two countries    also korean and japanese are quite similar grammar and sound wise  so it s easier for them to speak and sing  how many big asian singers are in the us  especially foreign ones    not a lot  so it s way harder than you think to just make it big  just because the total market is big  doesn t mean bts will take a large part of it  so if even japan s market is small  at least they have the opportunity to be a large part of it  if you watch some of their english interviews there s clearly an awkwardness with their cultural and language barrier  the western world is just not use to their style of quirky  it s not racist  look up what racist means  considering your idea of it  it would be racist if they didn t make songs in every other language as well  they did make a song in english   waste it on me  they don t need to make an english song to make it big  several of their songs have already charted high being in just korean  rm stated in entertainment weekly yesterday that they wouldn t make an english only song because they don t want to lose their identity   they re korean  not english  and they shouldn t have to bend over backwards for english only people  domt you that s a big entitled  why dont english singers make korean or any othet language songs  why do only non english people have to specifically please english people  the western market is so multicultural  we should not be afraid of songs that aren t in english  heck  despacito blew up  so why can t a korean song  we already know we don t need to understand the lyrics to appreciate a song  look at mumble rap  non lyrical songs  etc    bts is proud of who they are  and you as a fan should be as well  ,0,1875,343

 gt what i always find interesting is that if you re not a fan of bts  a lot of people don t think much of yoongi s presence in bts  he s always a little to the back  and i wouldn t be surprised if he looks like the less important member that was just tacked on to the group to non fans  that just reminded me of him saying he s the member who doesn t care the most about screentime in the recent bts armypedia talk show  haha  i thank god that he really chose to be an idol and part of the group instead of working behind the scenes  there s just  so much  he has done as an idol that i couldn t imagine how it could ve gone otherwise  ,0,637,122

obviously they aren t against english in their music  they wouldn t have recorded mic drop remix and waste it on me  to call them racists when they regard the us entertainment industry as highly as they obviously do is inaccurate and lame  not to mention many kinds of ethnicities speak english  so i m not following on the racist accusation   racists against whom  obviously there is a huge difference between making music in japanese and english  in japanese you cater to solely the japanese market  promoting full english albums is promoting it to the entire world  it would change there identity because their korean lyrics and identity would get buried in favor of music that s in english globally ,0,703,115

wow    well  kpop artists tend to either make chinese or japanese versions of their songs because it is an easy way to break it into the asian market rather than just the tiny country of south korea  plus china and japan are bigger markets for music than korea  with that said  that s why kpop artists do chinese or japanese versions  because they re not trying to be global superstars  kpop is from asia  japanese is also easier to translate from korean as the languages are very similar  i really don t like the  this is racism  standpoint tbh  it might just be the difference in culture  i am asian   but bts nor any other kpop artist has to sing in english to please anyone  bts is praised and so well liked worldwide because they are themselves and don t try to pretend they are anything but  please don t push this  bts has to sing in english to be popular or they are being racist   not everything is about the western world  p s  you already have waste it on me,0,969,176
kpop groups and japanese version releases have always been hand in hand and it was so normalized    in a sense that i didn t even think about this lmao  with that in mind though  i think since it s more or less a sure thing they d have japanese songs in their lifespan as a group that they re more prepared for it  unlike having english songs   amp  x200b  but who knows  waste it on me is a thing  english versions of songs are becoming common  maybe we ll get there eventually  ,0,480,86
 namjoon seriously has a beautiful soul  it shines so bright when he s in nature and i m really glad he shares this with us    ,0,127,24
i wrote a comment about this exact thing in a  thread so here it is  they do include some english in their songs  that s a part of their dna even maybe to a larger extent than a lot of other kpop groups  so there s no  anti english  mentality there  like rm says in the quote  it s about identity  both from the perspective of the group  who yes  probably does feel closer culturally to japan  more comfortable with the language etc    and from the point of view of fans  bts know their fanbase really well and they re aware that 1  most fans of kpop groups are into it precisely because it offers something different than western pop and that includes korean language  and 2  sincerity and lyrics are very important points to armys  and if bts were for instance to release a full english album in hopes of reaching a broader audience  they might very well lose a big part of makes them appealing to their core fanbase in the process  i think most fans see japanese albums as extra  optional content and it s pretty easy not to pay much attention to them  their impact is very limited outside of japan  full english group releases on the other hand would attract a lot more attention  scrutiny and would alter the image and identity of the group on a global scale ,0,1264,228

is not racism  they want to stay in their asian roots  since their debut they released songs in japanese  there s also a single of boy in luv in chinese   japanese albuns went well so is a thing for them since 2014  they dont need to keep releasing japanese albuns at this point  but since they are all doing since 2014 it will keep that way  but english songs will be different  i also think that is a part of their charm to the western media to keep releasing korean songs and also their indentidy as a korean group  they don t want to change that and is totally fine ,0,570,108
no way    this is all i ve ever wanted  pluto nation rise  ,0,59,11
japanese albums were part of the industry before bts even debuted  to not release those albums would have ruined any chance they had with japan  if you notice  their more current japanese albums only have a couple of songs  their clout is now enough that they can pull back  frankly  i don t want them to release an english album  they express themselves much better in korean  also  it would set expectations for the english speaking market  they d have to reduce their overall output just to keep accommodating people that are stuck in a language bubble  and their message would more than likely be watered down  this isn t about racism or one market warranting it while another doesn t  it s honestly just new territory because english markets are newer for korean groups  so why bother when the korean is getting such a good response ,0,838,141
it s both linguistically and culturally far far easier to translate from korean  gt  japanese than korean  gt  english  the sentence structure is almost identical and there s a lot less of a gap in things like untranslatable words or things that would have to be rephrased quite a bit to sound good in english  converting a korean song to japanese is a much smaller task than writing a song originally in english or rewriting a korean song in english  ,0,452,78
basically  you said it better than i could  they re human  we re only seeing one persona  stream persona  so i don t really mind it if fans latch on to a particular persona unless of course it s false and harmful   shrugs,0,221,39

uh  bts wasn t huge in the us until recently  early on  they were mostly following the standard kpop playbook  that is  market primarily to sk and japan  then try for the rest of the world later on  that means that of course they re going to start  early on  learning and singing in japanese  because that s expected both in the kpop industry and by the japanese who consume kpop  further  i have seen multiple people say that bts  japanese pronunciation isn t the best  but i m sure the japanese fans accept this as par for the course for most kpop idols  do you think western listeners would be so forgiving of songs in english that don t have flawless pronunciation  they also put out waste it on me  and the mic drop remix was mostly in english  though the pronunciation wasn t clear  that said  i notice you didn t say bts should sing in all spanish  though there s a huge market of spanish speakers  isn t it possibly  racism  on your part to expect songs in english  but not in spanish ,0,993,173

recently i was listening to some mono again  since i realized that i hadn t in far too long  i love it so much  it has such a distinct tone to all of it  and the lyrics are so good  and i ve built up a bunch of memories associated with the songs that are fun to remember  it was really interesting listening to forever rain again this time  since the first couple of listens  i ve always found it a really sad and like rather despairing song  the  forever rain  bit especially has always felt to me like softness  kind of calm and soothing  wrapped around a plainly discernible core of something cold and hard and hollow inside  that s a lot of metaphorical language  but i feel like it expresses well how i feel about the song  it s like surface calming but then tucked under the surface is this thin edge of despair that makes me feel a bit cold and empty inside  so it was really interesting to listen to the song again and have it not come across that way to me  it felt like   letting out a breath  that s the only way i can think of to describe it  it was really nice  actually  i felt like emotionally reading it that way made it fit with the album more  before  when it just seemed sad to me  it didn t really fit with the emotional progression of the album for me  but now it does  i just find really emotionally complex songs like this  ones where there s a lot of things going on and you can interpret it a lot of different ways and it kind of invites studying the lyrics and sound to get a better feel for it  really fascinating  and i m so hyped for the comeback  this will be my second comeback  and i found  just a little while before answer and wasn t really on top of all the news and stuff before that  so i m excited to be able to follow it more closely this time ,0,1783,339

as someone who played piano for over 10 years  actually 14  but i don t play as much anymore as i used to lol   i definitely see where you re coming from  but you kind of have to admit that he has that natural musical talent  or something along the lines  for knowing from memory how to play these songs  on pitch  he has decent posture  his wrists are curved up properly and he isn t exactly banging on the piano too hard  a little bit of banging but more practice can lessen it   but he can curve his fingers a little more so it s the tips of his fingers instead of where the fingerprint is at and straighten up his back  we can give him credit for that   ,0,658,125

all of them  i ve known bts for a long while  even though i only really went into stan mode around her comeback  so it s so funny when ppl talk about jin like he s actually like the confident chaos king persona he presents  like  sure  that s something he is and can access but literally every single person in the group and backstage have described him as more quiet  serious  professional and diligent  yoongi liked rooming with him cause jin was laid back and chill  so whenever fans go omg put jin in charge it d be pure chaos or smth like that it feels cringey to me cause that just doesn t feel true to me at all  yoongi and taehyung get the bad personality discourse most often  not always mean spirited but since they actually do and say stuff that idols aren t supposed to  keep it nice and fluffy for the audience   ppl discuss them often as being mean and lazy or immature and bratty  i think with tae there s kind of been a thing where the fandom has difficulty picking a dominant trait for him in recent years  after he calmed down so much and grew more reserved  there s no clear image for him anymore  and ppl do love those tv character traits   even if fans say they want the idols to be real  that s not really what they re for  considering the overreactions everytime someone has a bad day or acts differently than what s expected of them  there s clearly a reason why idols present themselves that way ,0,1421,253

i definitely second this  i really wish they would stop with the  4d alien  and  taetae language  labels  they lead to the unnecessary flanderization and infantilization to the point it has become really irritating  the  4d  is supposed to be a compliment in korean culture for having a unique personality  but the way some fans have been using it is just degrading and insulting to his personality  same with the alien  it s quite detrimental and dismissive of the  unique  part of his personality  also  don t get me started on the  taetae language   it just really makes him less educated and intelligent than he really is and is quite dismissive of his uniqueness as well he actually talks fine imo and as someone who was diagnosed  or misdiagnosed according to my parents  as  autistic  in my childhood due to social and language developmental delays  it not only makes me 100  uncomfortable  but also 100  sure that it makes him uncomfortable as well as someone who stans him  the flanderization and infantilization have gone to a point that there are some fans who see him as  weird  and or  dumb  instead of the creative and intelligent person he really is  it actually reminded me so much  why i relate to him so much  of my middle and high school days when i was made fun of my  unique personality  due to the social awkward part of my personality due to social and language developmental delays from my childhood that i couldn t really help by some of my peers while i was a top student in my classes  i was a namjoon of my high school  and sunday school some of the worst came from my sunday school and church youth group peers lol  back in the days  and a top and adept student in my math classes  throughout high school  i made the highest grades or one of the highest grades in my math classes  especially calculus in junior and senior years in high school  not to brag  but it s true  as well  and yes  my some of my classmates overlooked me as the  weird  and  funny   for no apparent reason class presentations were a nightmare for me  why i developed a fear of public speaking that carried on even today  i would see at least one or a small group of kids snickering at me whenever i presented something in front of the class  kid in their class instead of a top student  in both regular and sunday school  who was a true math geek  not only that  but he definitely reminds me exactly or almost exactly of my two best friends  one before college and the one i have right now  the best friend i had before college actually had exactly or almost exactly the same personality of tae and the same amount of endearment i have as well  she has a  4d personality  imo  she s generally friendly and gets along with pretty much everyone she meets  she contains a sophisticated or unconventional fashion sense  like tae  she can wear pajamas as everyday clothes as well lol    she has a high aptitude in language  she aced ap spanish and even took chinese 1 in our senior year of high school  and knowing other cultures  spanish and korean culture though i don t think she s a kpop fan lol   she also has an idealistic and optimistic view of the world and sometimes it may seem like she s in her own world  she has a tendency to be carried by her own identity and perspective of the world  when she s emotional  she can be pretty intense  like tae like that one time in high school she had a panic attack because she thought she messed up somewhere in one of our ap exams   etc  however  this similarity between the two of them stick out to me  like tae  she can seem to be carried by her own world  where the  4d alien  for tae comes from   but she s actually more intelligent than she actually appears  like tae  for instance  we were both in the same calculus class for both our junior and senior years of high school where she slept for every single class  so it doesn t seem like she gained anything from the class   but still got away with a s  not a  s  like actual a s  in the class every single marking period  tae s introvert extrovert level reminds me so much of my current best friend  some fans also seem to exaggerate his level of  extrovertness  as the  social butterfly  of the group he s actually a gregarious ambivert or a gregarious introverted extrovert  at best    my best friend is an entp  which is why we re very close to each other because i m the  introverted  version of him we technically have the same personality except i m the quieter one lol   which is the  thinking  counterpart of enfp  which is taehyung s mbti  he is definitely a classic textbook enfp   and he s definitely a gregarious ambivert he loves going out and hanging out with his friends  he has a large circle of friends  and you can always go somewhere and you would see him bouncing around and trying to talk with a bunch of people he s also more confident in meeting new people than i am  i m really shy around strangers  but he likes meeting and befriending them  and he definitely loves being around people however  when he s an environment where he doesn t think he can contribute much  just like taehyung you can see him in interviews  variety shows  ot7 vlives  etc    he just stays in his shell  thinks and observes what s going on  and doesn t talk much  just like taehyung  he s also has his long periods of introspection and can be pretty private as well  introvert extrovert isn t all about being sociable or not sociable and how many friends acquaintances you have  they re factors  but not complete   but also how you decide to spend your energy with either yourself  introvert  vs other people  extrovert  both tae and my best friend spend their energy in both ways  but they lean slightly more to other people  also  enfp s  taehyung  and entp s  my best friend  are known to be extrovert leaning ambiverts or introverted extroverts  at best  btw  haha this is longer than i expected it to be  but this type of frustration has led me to open more of my experiences back in middle school and college that i was afraid of opening up because i didn t want my feelings and frustrations of being  misunderstood  get the worst of me back then  and this helped me relate to tae and misconceptions of him   4d alien    dumb blonde   etc   by a lot  a lot of people in the comments are also mentioning yoongi as well and as an introvert that prefers leading by my thoughts and logic more than my feelings and emotions with a  tsundere  sort of personality  i can also relate to yoongi as well with my own introvertness and reservedness as well  i m kind of similar to him in terms of personality as well  we can be cold outside the exterior  i actually don t talk to people unless they talk to me first as a fact lol   but to the people we re close to  we can be quite nice and friendly people and caring to an extent  sometimes not in conventional ways   also  people should remember that on camera personalities and off camera personalities are not always the same while they re not exactly fake  there are times when on camera personalities are exaggerated a bit or made as an extension of that idol s personality as a way to attract or please fans to the group or even to the idol himself herself  so people should draw a line between off camera and on camera personalities imo  but there are some people who don t and that s where i think the misunderstanding of some idols come into place  ,0,7409,1291

\^\^\^\^\^ this  i ve always disliked the way that people label him as these labels as well  in korean culture  4d is supposed to be a compliment for having a unique personality  but the way they have been using the  4d  label on tae is just degrading and insulting to his personality  same with the alien  it s quite degrading and detrimental to his precious and admirable uniqueness as well  the 4d alien has gone to the point that so many people see him as the  weird guy  of the band instead of the truly intelligent and creative person he is  and thus  leads to the unnecessary flanderization and infantilization  even if some of these people are younger and even no smarter than tae himself  it just literally reminds me back in my middle and high school days when i was made fun of by some of my classmates for my  unique or weird personality  due to my social awkward personality  due to language and social developmental delays in my childhood  that i couldn t help having when i was one of the top students  i was the namjoon in my high school back then  in the class  so i can definitely relate to tae on this  also  they really need to stop with the  taetae language  as well  it makes him less educated and intelligent than he really is and dismissive of his uniqueness as well  and as someone who was diagnosed  or misdiagnosed according to my parents  as  autistic  in my childhood due to social and language developmental delays  it not only makes me 100  uncomfortable  but also makes me 100  sure  as someone who stans him  that it makes him uncomfortable as well  ,0,1583,283

i was recently cleaning out my facebook and found this  10 albums that will stay with you  list i had done a decade ago  it had remapping the human soul on it  and i thought    huh  that s still valid  it s stayed with me so long already  it probably actually will for the rest of my life too  it s a massive album but really a masterpiece  map the soul is one of my favorite single tracks  the lyrics of the korean version are really beautiful  it s maybe one of my favorite love songs  i attended their concerts just a couple of weeks ago  and honestly teared up a bit when they performed it  i somehow didn t expect it to be on the tracklist  one more thing  tablo in general has this aura of being this encouraging  idealistic godfather for baby rappers everywhere  but on pieces  part 1 there s this song called       pencil sharpener   it always makes me think of namjoon and yoongi  the album was released in 2008 when they were 14 and 15 respectively  it s like a gentle power anthem for young rappers  with [lyrics like]    gt the thick dreams are the first to fold but remember the first time you touched the mic fill your stomach with passion and don t fear everyone points fingers and tells you to follow the money even though you look pitiful it ll be your wings fly sky high your beautiful mind color the black and white world with your beautiful rhyme in this heartless city oh this godless city you re an artist dont lose your confidence in yourself and  gt in the moments of your life where the darkness loses its opening never forget that you become the sun for others i can t help but imagine them listening to this song  i wonder if it gave them courage and strength when they were just dreaming of being rappers  oof ,0,1738,314

i ve been into bts for only about 6 months  so i m no expert  i ll just say what i see  but i don t know how much my opinion is worth  and sorry for the novella in advance  i ve thought about this stuff sometimes and wanted to get it out  maybe others have noticed some of the same things  in terms of the public  i also think jin and jhope are the most misunderstood  as for myself  i would say i also misunderstand tae  or maybe not misunderstand  but still seek to understand  as others have pointed out  jin and jhope have fun  beagle personalities on camera  but i ve read articles that describe jin as  quiet  or  brooding   we also know he was very quiet and accommodating for suga when they roomed together  and namjoon  very early on  said he d never known or been able to understand someone like jin and that it took time to relate to him  i still question to this day what that means  as i haven t come across a clear answer  jin is the only member of bts  that i know of  who has a higher education  i may be wrong  though  and he has made certain off the cuff remarks about business and finance that make me believe he s more sophisticated than he lets on  he currently owns a restaurant and a flat  and from what i ve seen  the restaurant is doing very well and provides good quality to its customers  i also believe he traveled around the world and studied in other places  unlike the rest of bts  before joining  and he keeps in very regular touch with his mom  and has a song called  mom    and it s said that his family is wealthy  we also saw jin use expensive cookware from his home in the early days  given all this  i think jin may have been expected to complete his education so he d have a foundation in case bts doesn t succeed down the road  and i ve come to feel like he has one foot firmly planted in the adult  professional world and is competent for his age in that regard  he said years ago his mother didn t praise him in front of friends  and i question whether he had been raised with very high expectations for performance as well as social modesty to not appear socially tacky  he has said that  your hard work is for only you to know   but i think jin also still has a foot planted in the world of youth  so he loves games  toys  cute things  making new friends  and making others laugh  i think he has a very adult mind in many ways  and was raised to be such  but still has a young soul  it s typically the young soul on camera  however  as for hobi  i feel like he is still very rooted in his family and his familial identity  he s mentioned his father s profession many times  his father s cooking  how his family inspires him  and his song was mama  he said he wishes he had learned more about literature years ago  given his father s job  he cried during his family s birthday video to him  and while hobi often acts silly and loud  i notice that he can also show disapproval or hesitancy when he thinks other members are being too ridiculous  i believe he s very disciplined both physically and in habits  too  he s clean  he learned to rap from ground zero  and he s a dancing machine  i think he loves to perform and entertain  but that he also has a domestic  reserved side to him that takes extreme comfort in being with those he loves deeply and knows well  i also think he has a wicked  sarcastic sense of humor that comes out only sometimes  but when it does  you think   dang  that was sharp   as for tae  i ve come to realize that i can accurately describe a ton of his traits  but i admit i don t fully understand where he comes from or how he experiences the world  i find him more of an enigma than any other member  i recognize that tae experiences stimuli  situations  and social constructs in a way others don t  and that he also responds to them in a unique way  what makes this even more interesting to me is that he s completely sincere about it  and you can tell he is not merely seeking attention or trying to amuse people  he just does what he wants to do  and it s natural for him  and yet he also completely knows what to do and what to say to get the responses he wants out of people  he s clever  sometimes in an even scary way   amp  x200b   amp  x200b   amp  x200b ,0,4236,785

i don t think we understand any of them  really  i mean each of them has traits within their current life  or in their past  that are contradictory to the point of fascinating and mysterious  jimin   who s always falling down  frequently late  often clingy  class president for years  tae    who looks like he could walk down the catwalk at any fashion show in milan and spend his days walking down the champs elysees  grew up on a farm  yoongi    who gives off a sleepy grumpy vibe so often  is the one most likely to openly tell his fellow members that he loves them  also sounds like a professor  or maybe a music executive  when you get him talking about bts s process  its plans and its dreams  jungkook    mr  tough guy athlete who likes to punch his fellow members  apparently sensitive to scents and uses a fabric softener called adorable  you get my drift  these guys are all far more complex and complicated and human than we could ever imagine  it s fun to try  but i don t think we ll ever understand them   amp  x200b   amp  x200b   amp  x200b ,0,1057,183
in jin s latest solo v live  he ends it by talking about his pet that recently passed away  he was devastated  it was an eat jin video with funny rants but in that vulnerable moment i think we see seokjin instead of bts jin  truly heartbreaking and oh so precious ,0,264,49

what i always find interesting is that if you re not a fan of bts  a lot of people don t think much of yoongi s presence in bts  he s always a little to the back  and i wouldn t be surprised if he looks like the less important member that was just tacked on to the group to non fans  and then you become a fan and you re like  omg  he s like bts personified and super super important part of the group s music  mentality  support structure  goals  and i think bang pd once said in early days that suga give bts its bts flavor  ,0,527,100

all of them in different ways  people use what members have said and done to defend how they want to portray them to others in fandom  it s a lot of projecting from everyone  even me  it s mostly innocent but sometimes fans use it to manipulate how others view members to fit and justify their attitude outlook of the group or certain members  i can see how casual fans or new fans may especially believe certain stereotypes and myths  but longtime fans cherry picking what they do and don t want to see is being disingenuous  ,0,527,93
lately i ve been wondering a lot about who hobi is outside of being j hope  i also feel like his personality is hard to understand  it s interesting to know that other fans feel similarly  i understand that they all probably have sides that they want to keep private  i just hope he doesn t feel like he has to keep a poker face all the time ,0,342,64

i love how innocent they are with  sexually charged  english words  i m sure they would refrain from using the word  virgin  and name   egg slut  if they knew what those words meant  especially because they re the complete opposite of a sexually explicit and vulgar group     unless they re on stage then i m dead   the language barrier might hinder some of their ability to convery their thoughts but in this case it s just so pure and cute ,0,442,74

by newbies or fan  because 3 years with bts and i m still very surprised at how badly misunderstood jin  amp  hobi are by actual fans  especially jin  with hobi there s like 10  effort by some to actually understand him  jin not at all it feels like  both are beautifully human and say a ton with their body language and silent moments than fans allow them to with their words  by newbies  jungkook is the  angry one   tae is the  dumb one  and some fans try to make new fans think yoongi is the  scary one   fuck that noise  watch all the old content and nothing about yoongi has ever been scary  he was a bit reserved and there s nothing wrong with that  i don t know why some older fans are determined to stereotype him that way to new fans  it s utterly pointless and frustrating  ,0,785,144
i think the same thing  he shows his immediate emotions well   crying  scared  happy about something  but he kind of keeps his private stuff  well  private  some of the other members share their more personal feelings and going ons  like jimin and jk  but hobi    i used to think he was the easiest to know  but now i think he s the most reserved  ,0,348,63

imo  taehyung is the most misunderstood he s member who has gotten the worst flanderization by fans  fans don t understand his way of thinking and his personality most fans label what they don t understand as weird  abnormal ect just because you don t understand him doesn t make him  weird   he is definitely not dumb  man child ect and all that bs i see attached to him i wish these labels get axed  i wish people would be more open minded in understanding taehyung more  but nonetheless i honestly think people need to more self aware and realize that other people are more complex than the image they portray on camera  he may be innocent and playful in some ways  but he is part of the filthiest industry in the world and you don t veer through it being naive  ,0,766,136
i did vote out bst and chose spring day but spring day isn t on even my top5  the fandom generally has an emotional attachment to the song  the only way i understand is by examples from other artists  lose yourself is not eminem s best work and most fans would not even have it in their top10 but that s the song that gets the most reaction from a crowd fans and non fans alike  that s spring day for us  the song that lives on  ,0,429,82

i believe bts is the only group that use a full song intro as their comeback trailer  other groups like got7 used short films before their new album dropped  they never used any song from the album to do this  it would be a risk to do the same because of potential accusation on copying bts  nevertheless  this is a smart way to give us a sneak peek on the theme of the new album and maintain a strong storyline throughout their release ,0,437,83

jimin is a ball of fluff  our mochi  our angel and fairy  the most supportive friend with the cutest eye smile  but is also our demon and king of duality  just when you settle into the illusion that he is just the cute he throws you a curve ball  so don t let the cuteness distract you because that man is a slytherin  the cutest  loveliest  nicest slytherin but yes still a slytherin   there is also the fact that jimin has a certain androgynous beauty and elegance to him  especially when dancing  which makes jimin effect really powerful to the point that gender and sexuality is no longer a barrier and everyone just loves him   amp  x200b  anyway  welcome to the fandom  jimin is definitely a fav among the fans but so are the other members  they all have their own unique qualities which we really like and apppreciate ,0,825,146

the only time i have seen yoongi be labeled as  cold  and  scary  in the past two years is people who do everything in their power to remind the fandom that yoongi was once seen as  cold  and  scary   even for people new to the fandom  the most recent material interviews shows all have yoongi being his dumpling self  it s usually older pre 2017 videos that perpetuate this image anymore due to cherry picking videos that show him as cold  i would say any member at any given point could be misunderstood  just due to what they want to keep private versus what they allow us to see  unless they decide to be forthcoming about something  we re pretty much in the dark ,0,668,119

hmm i think it s natural for any of the members to be misunderstood at some point  especially by new fans and or the general public  some that i can think of at the moment  jin   it could be easy to misunderstand him as being always confident  never taking things seriously or even egotistical  but in truth  we know that especially at debut he had low confidence  he uses jokes to make others feel comfortable and his  worldwide handsome  thing is confident but humorous  not egotisical   suga   as people have already said  at first he can give the impression of being cold and aloof but the more interviews   bangtan bombs   v lives etc  you watch the more you see that he can be quite soft  he s just introverted  is clear of his own mind and is a music genious  also has a gummy smile    j hope   he is someone i misunderstood at first  he can be very over the top  extroverted and  in your face   i have to admit the first few things i watched  i found j hope a bit much  it was only as i fell deeper into bts that i really began to admire him as the  hope  of the group and see his more mature leadership side  jimin   i think he can be misunderstood as needy or attention seeking  whereas really he is just a perfectionist who doesnt fully recognise how talented he is  v   i think there s a quote somewhere from namjoon  which says v is sometimes misunderstood as a clown   silly but is actually a genius  i think he can be misunderstood as being in his own mind but he is actually noticing everything ,0,1511,283

yoongi as  cold  when he s literally the brother that would hold the umbrella for his other brother while getting his shoulder rained on to make sure the umbrella covers his brother  how if he argues with tae  he would hold his hand  how whenever someone does hi5 he ends up holding their hands instead  yoongi works so hard when he s awake that he sleeps to recharge when he can and it s often misunderstood as being lazy bc that s all they see in vids  he works on music off camera and sleeps in the comfortable company of his bts family  he s the softest his gummy smile is   and taehyung  the adjectives that still stuck to him till this day are the ones he expressed he didn t like   alien  weird  strange  there s more but the intention behind those words changed from being cute things during early debut to being mocking bc  fans  still label him as that despite how observant  caring  gentle  and warm he is  his mind works differently and to others that s perceived as weird and dumb  he s intelligent and worries too much x x remember the book  he wanted to learn how to communicate better  and jungkook  there s a portion of the fandom mainly composed of new fans or misguided or just plain rude  that dubbed him as a legit brat and spoiled  the boy started working at 15  he spent his middle school high school training and honing his skills while others his age were out playing and being spine breakers  he earned everything he got bc he paid for it with his own blood sweat and tears  he s good natured  well mannered  and dedicated and passionate and thoughtful and he s surrounded himself with good influences in a good environment to grow as a person  he is a fine young man  yet there s ppl that misunderstand judge him to be brat and spoiled  i wish people would think first before casting judgement on anyone they do not personally know in real life  especially when it is in demeaning way and disrespectful  and namjoon  if haven t noticed  he s the punching bag for everyone in existence whenever anyone decides to target bts  a young man like namjoon is a gem  one that learns and grows and doesn t shy away from his mistakes  but the thing is  people don t want to see his growth  the man beneath  his thoughts are so  soft and soulful and he works so hard and he overthinks so often  he s still so young too  and i say this for the whole of bts  they are good people  genuine people  but other people must first step on them before they give them a chance and majority of the time  they re scapegoated and hated on for merely existing ,0,2562,457

i don t recall other groups using full tracks as comeback trailers either  although those  full tracks  for bts tend to be album intros  come to think of it  they ve always had such stellar trailers for this reason  i think they can do this because their albums are so thematically cohesive  so the intro track will give an accurate taste of what to expect  therefore making a great trailer ,0,391,68

off the top of my head  monsta x does something similar where they release a short video called a  special film  or  music film  that s related to the album s concept  there might be other groups too i m not remembering  you can also think of it being similar to the western music industry model of releasing a lead single before the full album  but this way if encourages people to buy the full album and not just the one promoted song ,0,437,80

on one hand  youtube is really doing us dirty with these algorithm changes and i m very intimately aware of that as someone who streams  on another hand  yt is actually showing us   that people really really like this song because it s not slowing down  i think that persona has a lot of mainstream appeal and replay value and it s getting a lot of  those bts guys released something   clicks from people who watch bts mvs because their culturally relevant and sort of afforded the privilege of people checking them out just like they would any western artist who has a new song out  so on one hand as a dedicated streamer  i m miffed at the algorithm but as a fan i m happy with what the steady views may actually say about persona and bts   that it s becoming a cultural essential just like a new kendrick or drake song for example  and that s the dream right  ,0,863,154
i really love how the lyrics match the music by touching upon the past but also the present  like the lyrics at the start talk a lot about his transition from an underground rapper and his doubts from past but in the end they bring it back how he feels about it now  the music takes a sample from an old song but brings it forward with a sound to match the kind of feistiness and confrontational feel of the lyrics ,0,415,81

i agree that breaking records  mostly yt ones  isn t all that helpful right now if the goal is longevity in charting and remaining in the public consciousness  we could aim to break the goal of how long we can maintain _____  or even simpler break out a biweekly goal with daily goals for those who do best with smaller numbers and steps  i know we have conversations about goals each comeback and one of the topics is how to get everyone on the same page  i think we do better each time  but it takes time and everyone is just now learning how to do the previous comebacks much better in hindsight  which is the info i see floating around social media  so  i totally get the desire for change and its necessity  but it won t happen quickly  it s possible that next time anything we are able to adjust regarding implementation and resetting goals will actually be used by more people the next time and the next  if you or anyone has another plan  please share and some of us can approach this cb from that direction  who know if several alternative angles simultaneously might be the way to go and we could have fun in the process  ,0,1132,208

thank you  this is my point exactly  if you have decided to stan these artists for their music then go give all of it a try and listen to the old interviews they did about the different eras  there s just so much out there about the older eras but people just seem to focus more on hyyh and ly  all the eras bangtan has gone through are meaningful and they were able to talk more about the inspiration behind each song and album  it s one thing to listen to present day bangtan talk about their past music and a totally different one when listening to them in their teens talking about the school trilogy  this is why i know fans would also enjoy listening to bts talking about their older eras as they lived through them  their enthusiasm and approach to talking about their music hasn t changed  they have just expanded their knowledge and experience as they tried different themes and genres  at least say you listened to it first before you dismiss their music  plus you never know you may be surprised by actually liking different aspects of those eras ,0,1058,191

 gt this again is just their bias towards the genre which i don t care for   they are no different from people who say they won t listen to bts coz they sing in korean  honestly yes  i think army needs to open their eyes to this  i honestly accept them giving the older songs a real shot and then deciding that they don t like it because that s only fair  but being someone who is kinda going against the grain not listening to something in a language you understand  how can you seriously be shy of trying new things  i was personally reluctant to listen to old music because it was hip hop to  i thought hip hop was only about sex drugs  money  and women  then i remembered this is bts  this is the stuff they started out with and i trust them to have quality songs  and if they were able to build their careers on it then why not just check it out even if it really is just about alll those things  i don t care if songs are about sex  drugs etc but it gets a bit tiring  surprise it wasn t about any of that at all  i looked deeper into what they said about their old albums and what they thought about hip hop  i m pretty sure it was in the video of yoongi talking about the old albums for 80 minutes that made everything clear to me  hip hop isn t about hedonism  it s about true expression of oneself  it s about taking your experiances and your thoughts and just having a place to express them  to talk about them  based on this i think hip hop is a huge part of what made bts  bts  their songs are written from the heart with and honestly  that s what i think anyway  ,0,1577,300

i just barely finished all of my assignments yesterday  it was exhausting and i m planning on taking a few days break before diving into the remaining ones  the four assignments i had was basically to create art pieces  mainly through drawing  so i ve been churning out an insane amount of drawings  prior to this i always felt that if i managed to draw once a day  that was an accomplishment in itself  but during the past three weeks i ve been doing roughly 5 art pieces day  not that i would say they were my best work  but still  i made something  and i feel like drawing has become less daunting for me  i ve also become faster and am actually surprised by how well i can sketch given a short time limit  yay for improvement  and on to another topic  i m watching the new re make of hunter x hunter and    i don t really like it  it follows the story perfectly but even though this is one of my favourite shows i don t feel captivated at all  the combination of the animation and the music doesn t create much of an impact  i feel as if there s no real build up  it s just    plain  but i m gonna continue watching because i still love hxh ,0,1145,208
i get it but i don t get at the same time lol on one hand the song is set up to attract two completely different demographics  although lbr it s obvious which one is hard carrying this song lol  and it got so many spins on radio too  no long breaks in between the music video either so people use that version to listen to on youtube  on the other hand the song is beyond basic and cardi doesn t fit it at all  she s got one type of flow which is fine for certain songs but for songs like this      there s so many better female rappers out there  we need one of them to go mainstream instead ,0,593,117

i never implied you weren t a fan or didn t like their older stuff i was addressing you defending people who are ready to disparage their older songs coz it doesn t align to their taste  i didn t lecture you just provided a different opinion which seems to make you think i m some over emotional and over invested person without the knowledge that there are casual listeners of bts or people who just don t care to listen to different genres of music  if they can take their time to type that they don t like hiphop on a bangtan sub and not expect an army with a different opinion to chip in and question why not then they should stay away from voicing their opinions in the sub  it s all about discussion but if you can t take someone criticising your opinion then don t invite others to it by commenting it on an open platform  ,0,830,151

dude i ve been a fan for ages  i love their older stuff  and hip hop in general   you don t need to lecture me  i just    honestly think it s not that deep  it doesn t always have to be bias  though that does play a part for some  of course   it might just be actual personal taste  that people are afraid of expressing because they get lectured or piled on immediatly  which for most people is just not worth it  some people are just fans  they don t want or need anything deeper than that  some people just like their newer stuff  some just like their older stuff  some people have zero interest in them as people  that s all fine  i just think we need to learn to let those opinions be without pulling out the  well  actually  card  ,0,736,136

people will get defensive about the shitting or even side eyeing of a hiphop heavy album because that is who bts are  one of their personas if you please  i don t know which music these people were listening to but i don t remember the rap line disappearing at some point during ly era  again people can say they don t like their music all they want but these are the same people who will bop to outro tear and ddaeng and say   i like bts coz they don t sound like all the other sex  drug songs found in mainstream hiphop  these fans are the same ones they will pray for a rock heavy album but guess what that genre also sings about   yes   sex and drugs  so there lies the hypocrisy  they never bother to explore hiphop as a genre but are ready to praise bts as outliers when what the boys are actually just staying true to the roots of hiphop  this isn t a case of fans have to like every content their fave releases  this is a good time as any other for people to examine their bias  this isn t a case of edm vs hiphop  it s more of a hiphop artist exploring other genres and rapping over said genres but still releasing hiphop tracks  their older songs are actually rnb and hiphop heavy same with the current b sides  the only thing that changed is bts started to release more mainstream friendly title tracks  so if people keep on saying they don t like the older songs it begs the question do they really even take the time to learn who bts are as artists and the artistic journey they have taken to date  how can you even appreciate their growth if you never even listen to their older songs and explore their older eras  i m asking this because i have seen people outright saying they have never listened to the old albums and don t plan on doing so because they are hiphop heavy  this again is just their bias towards the genre which i don t care for   they are no different from people who say they won t listen to bts coz they sing in korean  what are you even going to talk about in ly era when you don t care to go through the school trilogy which is where it all began  i m actually looking forward to the new album coz i don t particularly care to dismiss music based on genre but hiphop as a genre has a special place in my life  it s about time as bts does a throwback that people take time to actually check out their older albums and eras coz they are important  even if you have to do it once i would recommend that armys do it  do that and watch ahl coz some people seem not to grasp how it s really beautiful for us to have a throwback to all these eras that have built the members both as artists and human beings  also if you have checked out the persona trailer then check out monster from rm and am i wrong coz the are some good parallels in terms of flow and message that would be a good throwback  ,0,2826,535

i don t think it s against the rules at all  yet  each comeback there are debates for an against lyric videos and reaction videos in the 1st 24 hours  mostly  i think  because many are trying to be sure the official music video is the top search result in addition to wanting to increase the view numbers from the gp and break records  etc  maybe next time  including a note encouraging readers to wait 24 hours before hyping reaction channels  would be a nice courtesy  but whatever floats your boat     ,0,505,90

it s one thing to say i don t like the new sound bts are taking and being entitled to think you can dictate the direction they take with their music  you can t conflate the criticism the handful of edm tracks got  even though i don t see the big hold up about not liking a song coz it s edm  with the hiphop songs and albums they have made  new armys who joined during the wings to ly era who keep saying they don t like hiphop keep forgetting that bts has 3 rappers who during those eras rapped over the edm  rock inspired music  it doesn t change that they are still rappers who take hiphop seriously  have paid homage to the founders of the genre and keep on staying true to their roots even as they experiment with different genres  ,0,737,136

guys hello  i noticed something that might be nothing but it really matches with the narrative   so namjoons coat the colorful one that has the hood  if you zoom in on some patches it say  pay no attention to the man behind the curtain  now i recognized that line from wizard of oz  and i remembered it had a meaning behind it so i googled the context explanation and basically the wizard who was seen as a great being by dorothy and gang   was discovered to just be a mere person behind a curtain  that complies with the idea of sorta discovering who the person who you are  if you also think about it it really matches with persona since persona literally means how a persons character is presented and like i mentioned the wizard was perceived as all mighty when actually he s a man behind the curtain  ,0,806,147

you and me are i the same boat my friend  because i experienced everything you just said  have been army for a little over a year now and like you it took me a while to get into their older stuff simply because i didn t have much of a taste for hip hop  rnb and especially rap  but i like to think that their was a dormant interest for it inside me because once i did start listening to it i really enjoyed it and it just made sense  in fact i attest my further interest or more appreciation for other rapper  especially korean rapper like zico and loco  to listening more to old school bts   anyway needless to say  like you  i m also incredibly happy and excited ,0,665,128

because i think suga wore a winter sweater in their first bts talk show when he was getting chased around by everyone xp  forgive me if i got this bts member wrong  i have very bad facial blindness     c    i want to treat myself to some fluffy winter sweaters next year  he looked so cute in his  so i want to get a couple myself  \^ \_\^ i remember back when i first got into k pop in my early 20 s  i wasn t really attracted to the women s k pop idols clothing so much  but more drawn to what the men wore  i just thought what they wore was so cute and i wanted to dress like them  \^ u\^ bts looks cute in their clothing most of the time as well  so when i see an outfit or a clothing item that looks good on them  i would love to wear something like it myself  \^ u\^ i have always been drawn toward androgynous clothing in my 20 s and in my mid older 20 s now  but i am finally starting to pull off the androgenous look so much that i feel so awkward if i ever wear something more feminine like a dress  o \_o  i m just so used to wearing jeans  i guess  xd i don t like looking too musculine outfit wise either  so i try to wear necklaces and sometimes bracelets to balance my outfits out  \^ \_\^ after seeing our boys wear such cute earrings as well  i have thought about percing my ears finally  but i don t feel comformatable putting piercings anywhere on my body in general  so yeah    dx i m afriad it will hurt if i do pierce my ears     c i know other women says it only hurts for a second when getting your ears pierced  but it freaks me out the same way that waxing your eyebrows does  it only hurts for a second sure  but it hurts  dx   i want to start going to the gym again as well and working out too so i can get a little more muscle on my body and i have an idea of the gym i want to join  it is a very nice gym and i do love the atmosphere in it  so i hope i will be able to join it soon  \^ \_\^ i apologize for the essay  dx  i just had a lot to say on the subject  haha    \^ u\^ ,0,2007,409

i love bt21 because they are freaks  they could be just cute mascots  but no  our weirdos had to make their creations weirdos too  i adore the oddness of some of the promo pics  like [this one of mang]     there s something about a masked character telling himself his reflection is him     and their wild quirks  like koya s ears or shooky s metaphysically challenging cycle of getting disintegrated in milk yet somehow staying alive or the fact mang s first scream at birth resembled a trap beat  i m not really interested in mascots in general  but they are  so freaky  i can t help but love them  if there s gonna be a plot based series  i d love for that oddness to not be diluted too much  i d rather it not be quite toddler level simple  but contained some of that quirk that the concepts have shown  of course while still being appropriate for kids   a bit like adventure time   i m also thinking back to some of the first promo pics we got  [example 1]   [example 2]   [example 3]   and what a neat atmosphere they had  there s a hyyh like vibe to them  just in a more surreal  fantastic world  the world of these promo pics looks like something i d love to see in a series  but ultimately  i know i m asking quite a lot from something that probably does end up being more in the direction of the small video clips we e already seen ,0,1342,240

i think it would be fun if the show were to still keep the element of tata coming from outer space and meeting 6 new friends and have fun adventures together with all of them in a boyband or not  \^ \_\^ i would love to see individual episodes of tata meeting his friends one by one as he gathers all of them together  i would also really love for the show to cover serious topics as well children and adults face alike such as happiness  sadness  love  anger  death  jealousy  infatuation  bullying  being different  animals  pets or not   loving yourself  taking something without asking  etc  and have each character offer their advice to other characters going through a troubling time concerning these subjects through each bts member s own words from their character  maybe even explaing what certain objects and events are to the audience if the viewer is not familiar with what the object or events are  \^ \_\^ it would also be really cool if our boys got to voice act their own characters  it would be so much fun to see  \^ \_\^,0,1039,186
you know how after each show bts holds slogans  those are part of army time  it s not funded by big hit and actually organized by fans  so fan bases translators ask big hit if they can run it for a date of a concert and once they get approval that s when they open donations  if the donation amount doesn t get reached they either decide to run with it and only give the funded slogans to the front of the crowd where bts will actually see it or they ll refund the money ,0,471,90

for me it s not necessarily a specific song or specific songs  it s their voices in general that calm me down  which is kind of strange  i guess  but i ve always had a thing about voices  whenever anxiety kicks in  especially in public  nothing calms me down quicker than a bts song  whether it s a slow song or a hyped one  their voices just make me feel grounded and when i m anxious their music feels like a big  fluffy blanket that i m hiding under and that s shielding me from the world  yoongi s voice in particular works really well for me  so i do often put on seesaw  hope you figured out which song s  work for you and that you re feeling better  op  sending good thoughts your way ,0,692,126

glad you opened up this dicussion  i got into them during wings   and so all i ve really known them for is the dramatic glory of that era  that and the the memes is what really dragged me down the rabbit hole  however it s been a while  and i ve had the chance to look back at the roots and their beginning as a tentative hip hop group  while the genre is not unappealing to me  they just didn t seem fully confident in that era  later  during ly  confidence really shone through  and i think it has the potential to transcend genres  i feel like now  bangtan can properly and pridefully present hip hop with their own twist  and it would not feel awkward  honestly their charisma and confidence is what brings the house down  and they shouldn t be restricted by genre  i will say  personally stuff like bs amp t and fake love is immediately immersive for me  most likely due to my own preferences in art  have a thirst for dramatic visuals and music   ,0,953,173

yup  web toon taehyung really cares about his friends  i agree  i guess something happens pretty bad next chapter from reading some army s comments in this thread  o \_o i m kind of hoping they all get taken by the hospital security staff and get locked up as well and seokjin has to save all of the one by one  xd  plot twist that screws up the going back in time thing  8d maybe jimin can stay with seokjin and help him out rescuing them or something    d i hope seokjin tells them the truth next chapter as they are walking jimin down the stairs and totally breaks down or something  it would be a nice dramatic scene if that were to happen next chapter  \^ \_\^  amp  x200b   amp  x200b ,0,691,128

i dunno    i think it rather highlights the past  in my op minor  mistake which he has already so clearly owned and asked forgiveness for  by the cliche phrase   non bis in dem   i rather think this could be unnecessarily attracting attention to what newer armies are incognizant of    right now  rm is the respected leader and the next generational icon in the entertainment industry  he is who represents the whole group and their voice  rightfully so  at least from what i gather this is the sentiment in korean gp right now  but to point in the wrongful direction could actually be    i would be more careful  korean gp s are much more unforgiving and more judging when it comes to mistakes  please know that by bias is namjoon and i speak in care and sincere concern for his rep  ,0,785,139

i think i have a idea about the new album  it s long i m sorry  in this comeback trailer  the black board and the room has persona  shadow  ego  who am i  who are you  dream  love and happiness written all over it  this is important later   rm raps about finding himself and others finding themselves  who the hell am i   at 1 40    do you wanna die    at 1 43   where s your soul  where s your dream     at 1 47   do you think you re alive   at 1 49   the  me  that i remember  and people know   the  me  that i created myself to vent out    at 2 04   the  me  that i want myself to be    at 2 23   these aren t all the examples  but you get the point  i believe that namjoon is saying this because at the end of the love yourself  all the members love themselves after fake love where they made a fake persona for a girl they loved  but the members never lost their fake persona and throughout the album  bts will find themselves  also  i believe that in the map of the soul album  bts will meet txt and mentor them into love themselves and love their horns  which is why rm says  where s your soul  where s your dream    etc  as in crown  txt grows horns on their head and a person with wings  this is bts  teaches them to love themselves as bts had just finished the love yourself era they could teach them how to love themselves as in crown  txt hate their horns and want to run away and want to be saved by the person with wings   wanna run away  wanna disappear  far away also   are your wings the same pain like mine  and   save me  who am i  i don t know who i am  and  who you   which i think is refusing to bts   so  throughout the album  bts will mentor txt to love themselves and through other experiences throughout the album they will have multiple experiences and will find themselves and who they are but  bts will go through problems  which i believe what map of a soul  shadow will be about  but bts  probably jin  because it s always jin  just joking  will fix this  then bts will almost fail txt  which is what map of a soul  ego will be about  as txt will have too much self confidence and develop a huge ego but bts will stop this and teach them how to not be cocky  thus  making map of a soul  dream  love and happiness  which i believe will be albums to end the map of the soul era were bts will find themselves  txt will love themselves and both groups will be happy with who they are   ,0,2413,454

thank you for your visit and kind words  thankfully though  the focus of this campaign  kim namjoon isn t dealing with allegations of being a general asshole   while a complex issue  the  but namjoon  narrative began around 2013 2014 when said person was accused of 1  cultural appropriation for wearing dreads and imitating hip hop culture  and 2  flowjacking j cole s  born singer  and kanye west s  black skinhead  when the band released [ born singer ]   and [ bts concept trailer ]   respectively  it s gotten to the point where for any idea bts released that shared similarities with other k pop groups  much online hate and anger would be directed towards them  and namjoon in particular  thankfully  this has mostly stopped but we plan to mobilize and so that we can transform the disruptive force carried by  but namjoon  into an uplifting one  again  thank you very much for your time  ,0,896,144
exactly  i love their albums  but i got to miss the old kind of vibe  their ly era was feeling it was pop hiphop songs which were mostly made by vocal lines and the rap was added  it makes sense since loving yourself give you soft  hopeful vibes  not like dark  amp wild haha  old bts was mostly rap line  and their recent albums were more of vocal line  showing bts growth in trying different stuff  so    maybe this time the are showing their balance  also i feel like  just like many fans knew bts with ly era and the ones who were already bts fans from d amp w and previous album must have felt the change too and decided to go on hiatus  now could be viceversa  but i don t feel they will leave  my prediction for this album is like bts is reflecting on their old and present music  so they are gonna the mix of this ,0,822,156

i definitely see your perspective  and it s a totally valid one too  none of us want to engage in crude fights with another fandom  reference to this section on the original post   gt i shall reiterate this with distinct clarity  the intent of this campaign  is not  to pick a fight and or belittle any other artist or fandom  rather  we are to use it both as a tool to regain power over a word that has once hurt us  and as a rally of support to kim namjoon himself by showing that army is ready to move on from the once painful narrative with him  i want  none  of us  as a collective to go out and spread malice to other groups  we and bts have already gone through a lot early on and would not want the same fate to befall any other group  but  in defense of the campaign  the focus is on conveying positivity and support to namjoon  our goal is to root him on for taking back the power of the  but namjoon  narrative  unfortunately  being aware of the current situation that s going on amongst other fanbases  there can be no realistic scenario where someone will take the campaign the wrong way  let us be there for them while they grieve  let us help them cope with their loss with empathy and sincerity  let us clarify that our intent is never to mock or spite them  if some cannot understand that and acts hostile  then i m sorry to say but we must peacefully disengage  mute and block ,0,1395,259

mine is super late but the story is kinda unique i think    xd so a friend of mine asked me if i wanted to attend a shinee  kpop concert with her  i had vaguely heard of them in high school and wasn t really against kpop as i listen to a lot of jpop  i didn t really have any sort of bias but i had never really been interested in kpop before when one of my friends had showed me a variety of mvs  either way i ended up going and having a really good time and wanted to listen to other groups as well  while we were in line  we met up with another one of our friends who was very eager to explain to me things about kpop  she actually told me that i should never get into bts or exo because they were overrated  their fans were scary  the usual sort of thing  however when i went home that day  the curiosity killed me and i ended up looking up both groups and watching all their mvs and dope bst got me in the rabbit hole       amp  x200b  it was kind of slowgoing for me where i only listened to their music and was vaguely interested in a few other groups but i remember them starting their wings tour and seeing clips of them goofing around or being cute on twitter that eventually made me become a full army around the time the first bbmas rolled around     i ll always remember sitting with my friend so eager just to see a bit of them in the background  ,0,1361,268

hm i get your feelings on the kpop industry   the more u learn it is very  off putting  i was a casual listener to kpop songs   somehow bts was always in my top song list  cause i liked the korean language through watching kdramas    started watching some varity shows so i learnt about some idols  then more about the industry then by chance i got interested in bts and way people made such a big fuss on an mv that was swiched by an hacker     and i ended up learning more about bts and about their lyrics  personalities and a lot more about the industry  how things work etc  now i am an army only   thought i never called my self a fan of anyone  and i would say bts is way different and so far bighit as well   from day one bts got a studio  they wrote their own music  released projects and started to communicate with their fans on twitter youtube     it s not really fair that all the missdeeds and things that go wrong in that industry are also linked to bts     and on the other hand bts has had to fight hard to get any attantion from their country now they have that attation but still the big companies try their best to stay on top    and downplay bts hard and make it into a kpop kwave is succeeding thing      uff this ended up in a rant  p s bts started out to use youtube and twitter heavly because they didnt get to promote much on varitey shows etc  so they started to use those plattforms especially   and later vlive      that direct interaction from the beginning was and i think still is not commen in that industry as companys fear that the idols will mess up and want to controll their image etc  of course there are groups that also get the freedom but i think a lot are post bts     success ,0,1719,332

i thought so too    the articles they wrote about bts  especially by one writer were so bias  a disaster  and then that same writer suddenly goes to a concert of a certain group in the us  how does that work  magically have press passes hmm,0,240,45

[yonhap news agency]  ,0,22,3
haha true i used to try not to laugh out loud when i watch bris  anthony is mellow and really thinks about it\  i think bris once mentioned in a vlog that he saw anthony at the concert  or was it the other way around   but he needed to line up so he apologized if he seemed like he was in a hurry lol,0,300,64
i don t really see ppl saying the newer albums are more generic or anything like that in this thread haha  i think it s just preference and difference in music taste  i think for ppl that have gotten into bts because of their more hip hop based sounds back then are just excited to hear those sounds resurfacing again  i don t want ppl to misunderstand that me being excited abt this particular sound is a diss to their other sounds that they ve experimented w  i think that goes for most fans that are excited after this trailer too ,0,534,96
oh no  i know that their status was a huge part of it  but  i always interpreted the article as they were unhappy also with the identities they were asked to take  even now  when they talk about then    they seem to cringe a lot  which is understandable  they  as all teens do  struggled with their identity  i wish i could find that article  it s been forever since  and  i agree  they are definitely fighting words  i gave her a hard time for it a lot when we used to hang out more ,0,484,94
xceleste is great if you like delving into the theory side of bts  and a lot of the times she gets it right  even the stuff she ends up wrong about  always seems plausible   anthony too  jre  joseochoatv  and rt tv are great  in my opinion  because they listen to more than just the title tracks  they have great appreciation to bts  music and message  they ve also delved into other kpop artists  and like them  and continue to listen to them  so i don t feel that they re faking their interests in the genre ,0,510,93
 gt are you suggesting that we tweet things such as   butnamjoon hypes and supports lgbtq artists   yes  exactly like how you ve imagined  we do so much of this already everywhere  all we need now is a commonplace hashtag to build up the foundation of a social media trend  it can be general like   butnamjoon has the cutest dimples periodt  or personal like  i often feel like no one cares about what happens to me   butnamjoon always cheers me on and wants me to love myself  so i ll keep fighting on   anyone can do what they want with the hashtag and how to format it  as long as it maintains the core message that we want to spread  our endgame is that we can trend this online  to the point where namjoon can see all of our love and support for him  so he knows that we re with him through thick and thin   psst    if we re lucky  we can get namjoon s biggest fan account     in on this too lol ,0,901,168
lol yeah i like watching bris these days because sometimes he can put in an occasionally good input depending on the video  but i mainly watch him as one of those reactors that gives off hype energy and gets excited to watch things and not really because i care about what he really thinks about an mv or song  as mean as that may sound  anthony is one of those reactors where i actually really care about what he has to say about a song mv and his opinion and interpretation on things because you can tell he loves doing research and learning about what some of the songs  really  mean  like when he watched those in depth videos about baepsae and ddaeng and seemed to gain an even bigger appreciation for the songs as a result  i always look forward to his reactions  he s so chill and open minded and it s great to watch him explore bts  discography ,0,853,158
i follow this person on twitter and the hilarious thing is that they actually posted a really lengthy  articulate analysis of the lyrics and how meaningful they were but the tweet they got clout for is  colossal schlong power  and they were  so  [embarrassed]   when they found out,0,281,48
today was my day off from work  i was going to have a normal day dreading to do laundry and other chores  and start rewatching music videos for the bangtan universe    but the moment i woke up     bam      a comeback teaser was released  and i was instantly mesmerized the moment king namjoon popped up on the screen  for my first comeback  this started off super strong  i did do laundry  yes  but my mind was still on per  so    na    i also finally ordered myself an army bomb  may is coming so soon    ,0,506,93
i wonder if namjoon knows we call him president  he s got to since he lurks and other armys think the banner is a reference  i hope he knows because he deserves to know how much we love him,0,189,38

honestly  it was forever ago that i came across it  i always interpreted it as not an issue with the sound itself but because of the issue with the identity they were asked to take  rm and suga going from underground rap to being in an idol group  and so on  even now they look really uncomfortable when they look back  like  yeah  not having the status they wanted was a huge part of the unhappiness but they were  as all teens do  struggling with their identity  ,0,465,87
i got laid off yesterday woo  i don t know what to do with myself  devote my entire days to supporting this comeback maybe   anyone want to give me suggestions of all the things they wish they could do if they had more time  cause that s what i got right now  ,0,260,50
true\  i knew he would be one when i watched him introduce outro tear to his friends and it s been nice watching him especially since i found him  bris and track pop at their early stages ta the same time so it was fun  it s like almost watching a rookie debut  but for reactors  lolz,0,284,54
thank you so much  looks like i ve got a wonderful night ahead of me    these boys are always cracking me up and pulling me in more every time i watch something new  ive pulled my 13 year old step daughter into bts run  we spent a couple hours watching it together after my little ones  7 daughter 5 son  went to bed  it s something new for us to bond on with her becoming a teenager  which i really needed since she s really not into making crafts or watching me cook any more    the little ones really like the song fire and mic drop  now i just have to get my frank zappa loving husband in  i m hoping snl can help with that  thank you again i really appreciate it  i m going to watch it as soon as i tuck in my kiddos ,0,722,143

 gt  i remember reading once that everyone was really unhappy during sla and d amp w because the concept wasn t them  do you remember where  o  cause i remember them struggling the most when they switched their sound up from d amp w to hyyh  there s an extensive interview yoongi and joon did talking abt their struggles abt identity around this time and how they feel abt going for a more public friendly sound concept w i need u and the flower boy look  most of their unhappiness w d amp w seems to be cause their title at the time   danger   tanked really hard in the digital charts haha  i don t remember them talking abt the cause being abt the concept tho  though  they do look like they get hella embarrassed revisiting their looks back then now ,0,753,131
a satoori song would complete me omg,0,36,7
i just wanna put another line of thought here  if we look at all the bts member s solos or covers or the different mixtapes     i think its pretty obvious that the members themselves have different musical taste     not all of them are so big on hip hop  specially now   amp  x200b  they all have different strengths and after disbandment talk i think they have mentioned several times now how different they are to each and want different things  so while they ve done different genre of music in last few albums to show versatility and people say its to please different fans    i think it was also to highlight the strengths of each member      amp  x200b  at the end of the day they are a band and a group project even if they started out around one member and in order for the group to continue they need to find ways to satisfy each of the members  i am all for hip hop bangtan and i loveeeeee  war of hormone  and wish it released in recent times so it got more attention albeit with slightly more mature lyrics   amp  x200b  but if people are saying their newer albums are more generic or about trying to please everybody  well if that everybody is the members themselves then i don t see anything wrong with it  because as long as they all stay together i think they can and will cover any genre thrown at them  ,0,1321,239
they weren t unhappy back then because of the music   they were unhappy about their status and not having the success they wanted  which is why bang pd made the change to hyyh sound  to appeal to idol fans more  joon faced backlash bc of his history in the underground and other controversies  and no offense to your friend  but them s fighting words ,0,351,63

exactly  if mots p has a largely hip hop sound and some fans don t agree with it  that s their right  but you have to ask why they re fans of bts in the first place  like you said  hip hop is their root  they literally came into the scene with purely hip hop music  ,0,266,52
slow rabbit commented on hissnoise s insta  we love a supportive family  ,0,73,11
yeah  i ve mentioned it here many times before  but i am digging their  new music   2016 2018  than their debut sound  it s kinda the opposite from other armys  some even decided to  unstan  after hyyh era  so when i first had the inkling that they ll go back to their roots this time around i decided to lower my expectations a bit  but this trailer is fire  namjoon just oozes confidence and the rap itself is pure straight bars  so dynamic and fluid and hype  and the lyrics are all so damn personal  that s one of the reasons why i love the rapline so much ,0,561,103

when my friend introduced me to bts she told me to ignore skool luv affair and dark and wild  because they weren t as good as everything that came with wings and after  i went back and listened to everything  though  and i love sla and d amp w just as much as everything else they ve put out  so  i m not concerned that they are going back to that sound  in fact  i m excited  i had a feeling we were going back in time  what better way to fix the past then go back to the first concept and do it the right way  on another level  i remember reading once that everyone was really unhappy during sla and d amp w because the concept wasn t them  rm specifically faced a lot of backlash over his identity as a rapper and an idol  it s a huge power move  in my opinion  to go back to a concept that you weren t totally happy with to revisit and put a new spin on it  so you are happy with it  it also fits what we are expecting this albums main concept to be  persona  gt  what s expected of you from society  maybe i m just talking out of my ass and i m way off the mark  bts and bighit likes playing us like that  but i m excited either way ,0,1138,221

can confirm  honestly before bts  i wasn t really a hip hop sort of music person  growing up in the west  i wasn t too fond of the hip hop music and only had few songs i liked   but after i got into bts  ly  tear era   i realized that they had their roots tied pretty deep in hip hop and i became more open to the genre  i am super excited to hear this album  ,0,360,74
it really does  i thought i was doing so well being chill and patient  but then namjoon slapped me with the full force of his talent and now every second i can t listen to the album is torture  ,0,194,38

i will repeat this over and over again  namjoon is a lyrical genius and this comeback trailer is a visual and lyrical masterpiece  i don t think i ve ever been so hype abt a comeback trailer before   this one smacked me in the face and i said thank you  this is it guys   this is   the   comeback    i m so excited i can t even imagine what the whole album is gonna sound like  title track teasers are coming next    are they gonna be classic bighit and give us a completely different sound than from what the actual song sounds like  or will they stick with it this time lol we shall see ,0,589,106

ahh  exactly this  i almost started tearing up lol  such a good comment and very well written ,0,94,17
as someone who doesn t normally listen to hip hop  i am all ears  i m very open minded to whatever genre of music they will release  and music in general  actually   it s actually a good thing that they re able to experiment a vast amount of musical styles throughout  i listened to their entire discography a few months back  aaand i might do it again soon  and i admired how many different sounds they ve gone through  and not just each album   love yourself  answer  didn t stick to one genre  at all    it shows that they re not going to just stay in one lane of music for every album they make  in a sense it gives them a chance to figure out which style stands out to them the most  from what i took from listening to their discography also is that they never ever left their hip hop rap roots  but  yeah for someone who never listened to much hip hop  bts opened up a new type of sound for me  even since the lyrics are mostly in korean  it s amazing as you would say regardless of language  music breaks down barriers  like earlier today i gave  skool love affair  special addition  another listen and was sucked into that early 90s hip hop world of their since that persona teaser shared that lovely sound  it makes my heart happy to hear such nostalgia from the teaser  they bring that type of hip hop era into their music and make it modern present  that s another thing i notice about their music  and another reason why i love listening to them besides  i think based on my novel comment  i am very much excited to hear this potential original bangtan  ,0,1566,283

your experience is the reason i avoided bts for quite some time  i become obsessed about things i really like  it s as if i need to know every little detail immediately  for example i would get a new game  put in so many hours  finish it and leave with that odd empty feeling  i would fill that empty feeling by writing and reading fanfics  reading theories  watching clips of it  talk about it a lot  dream about it  but that empty feeling would always remain because i had already consumed the original content  like you  it brought me joy when i would consume this content  but i would feel a bit sad outside of that world  and in the end the fanfics i enjoyed were sad ones which reflected my mood and kinda influenced my mental health  and not in a good way  from what i ve gathered here  a lot of people seem to have gone through the same thing  that doesn t mean it s normal though  it s far from normal  being obsessive might even lead to being possessive and that s just not good for any of the parties involved  now a few months ago i decided to finally watch a few bangtan bombs  but because i knew what would happen if i didn t control myself  i limited myself  i have watched all the mv s but just a small amount of bangtan bombs  i watched a few v lives  i can count those on my hand  what i m saying is that the key to getting a healthier relationship with bts is limiting yourself  look at bts and realise that they are just seven guys  yes they are awesome people but in the end they are still human  you don t need to have seen every video  they promote self love  love yourself because you are worth it  and don t do it for them  do it for yourself  go out into the world  take their advice with you but let them go for a few moments  then at the end of the day  see if there is something new   again  you don t need to know every little detail  it s okay to just be a bit more casual  i think it would be a whole lot more awesome if you re a casual fan that takes care of their mental health than being a hardcore fan and bursting at the seams  sorry for the wall of text  if you re reading this i just want you to know that i really want you to feel better  ,0,2179,420

the thing with bangtan is they usually mix and match a lot when it comes to their songs and albums  if you take any album of theirs you cannot safely place it in one genre  so i am expecting the same a mix and match  wishlist   hip hop   rock  synth rock punk rock or old school classic rock ,0,292,54

i m kind of shocked  a comment i wrote yesterday about bts being superheroes matches up with namjoon s lyrics in pers ona     namjoon said this in persona     i dreamt of becoming a superhero  now it feels like i really became one     i wrote this yesterday    [    i like them a lot for the same reason people like superhero stories    look at hero stories like spider man  sailor moon  superman  wonder woman  etc   they are peter parker  or miles morales   or usagi tsukino  or clark kent  or diana  they have their  real  lives with their relationships  responsibilities  struggles  rivals  and trivial stuff  just so with bts  jimin is always late  namjoon breaks stuff  yoongi just wants you all to be quiet  jin s  mom might call suddenly   jhope shrieks in fear during amusement park rides  jungkook has a collection of luxury lip products  tae would prefer to not wear shoes  and maybe not brush his hair   but when they re in costume and  on   they perform amazing feats nobody else is performing right now  like superheroes  we know the lives of bts members through their social media and shows  or at least  we know the story of their  regular  lives  but when they perform as bts  they re basically the dancing and singing equivalent of voltron  they come together to create something like nobody else  and they can do this because they ve invested thousands of hours of practice into being excellent at what they do  watching bts is like watching spider man swing through the sky  or seeing usagi tsukino change from a clumsy schoolgirl into a magical warrior  the narrative of bts is one of transformation  duality  human potential  and fighting against society s preconceived notions of sex  gender  race  nationality  economics  and class structure  once you get to know them and their background  you realize their story and ability to entertain are as engaging as anything you can find in marvel  dc  or manga ,0,1929,316

i became army in 2014 when they dropped  boy in luv   which also had rock vibes that i fell head over heals for   so needless to say i freaked out when i saw the visual callbacks to skool luv affair in the persona trailer  naively  i assumed until recently that a lot of fans like hip hop because i ve always associated bangtan with hip hop  but it came to my attention that this isn t the case when discussing  outro  tear  s low popularity relative to other tracks  ultimately  i think bts needs to make the music they want to make  and if that means going back to their hip hop roots  then it ll be wonderful  they re already well established in the west by now  so i hope they were comfortable in expressing themselves while crafting this next album  also  the rap line is criminally underrated and people need to remember that the rap line is the entire foundation of the group  as well as being the three first members of the final lineup  in a way   if you can t accept their roots  then you can t accept them  army is so huge and diverse now that not everyone is going to resonate with every single track and i think we just have to be at peace with that  and their message and lyrical themes are always more important than the genre they re framed in  i have confidence that true army will give the music a chance because of that ,0,1339,245
looking at the sheer volume of this thread  it is starting to look like too many army s bought extra tickets in a panic  and there are plenty of scalpers who over bought tickets as well  i hope that there are not too many empty seats in the stadiums     ,0,254,48

i personally think that dark  amp  wild album is ahead of its time  it s def up there on my top 3 fave bts album  and if they are really going back to that era  i ll be beyond ecstatic  also  bts in general are very diverse with their genre  you can have variety of genres from one single album even from their old ones so the fear of alienating new fans bc of their potential return to old school bangtan is doubtful imo  they may have a hiphop or r amp b heavy title track but im pretty sure their bsides will offer something else  hopefully  whatever genre it may be  im pretty sure it will be of high quality regardless  ,0,625,118

pop bangtan enthusiasts had their day in the sun and now it s time for hiphop bangtan enthusiasts to get their shine  we ve been waiting for years  2018 was them moving back in this direction and now for persona  i hope they don t hold back very much at all  i m perfectly fine with this album not trying to please everybody  i think tear kinda suffered a bit for that so i hope they keep this album more consistent  that being said  there s always a little something for everybody in their albums so i m not worried about it appealing to the fanbase as a whole,0,561,103
whew i wasn t expecting to get anything today  but what an awesome surprise this was  namjoon as usual absolutely killed it  also i love the blonde hair  actually his whole look in this was amazing  not going to try and make assumptions from this though as to what the rest of the album will be like  since the intro is often much different ,0,341,63
dude  i soooo miss the rock vibes from skool luv affair and dark  amp  wild  it s part of what drew me into their music when they first dropped  boy in luv   i would be so  so happy  i would also love more orchestral production akin to tracks like  outro  tear   but  more than anything stylistically  i just want bts to settle back on their haunches  now that the ly foray onto the western stage is over  i want them to relax and just make the music they want to make  of course there s always expectations  but i want them to finally exhale and be allowed more creative control  i feel a bit like bh tightened the reigns on production during the love yourself era  which is understandable   and i adore love yourself  but please just let yoongi and namjoon  and whoever else  go wild ,0,786,144

whew  this is hard to nail down      namjoon  [something like this]    prada   which i think would compliment the long  very masculine lines of his form without overshadowing his face  i feel like he can pull off a lot of quirky  unique looks  or [this more formal look by boss]   but definitely with glasses    jin  [boss]   sleek  expensive  classic  with high necklines  feels right for him    yoongi  [amiri]   love him in anything black  leather  or silk  or anything with an edgy asymmetrical or vintage type silhouette and detailing    hoseok  [wooyoungmi]   something about it reminds me of boy meets evil  maybe it s the cuffs i dunno  but i love him in vintage inspired fabrics or overlarge lapels    jimin  [wooyoungmi]   not crazy about the idea of a large coat masking his figure  but he d have fun with it  love the earring too    taehyung  [d amp g]   tae totally has the strong facial features to pull all this fabric off without fading into the background  and he always looks amazing in flowy  loose fitted clothing  even back before he could afford designer brands    jungkook  [this stunner]   by yohji yamamoto  i love yamamoto s designs for yoongi too as they re dark and edgy yet have a lot of shine to them too  but i wonder if all these large folds would overwhelm yoongi s more delicate build  kookie would totally work it though  especially those majestic coat collar  lol i realize this wouldn t resemble anything close to a cohesive collection  but that s alright  and in terms of music     [adore you]   by nao or  [do you remember]   by jarryd james   amp  x200b ,0,1594,264

i can barely find the words to describe how exospherically ecstatic i am about experiencing their new old hip hop sound in the present  ready to sprint 5 laps around the block  that being said  i wouldn t bank on persona being wholly hip hop  they ve always placed storytelling as their top priority and i trust that they will employ the most organic and visceral sounds to help communicate the message they we want to say  if their discography has been a show for anything  it is that bangtan have the musical versatility to deliver the authenticity that has propelled them to the place they are today ,0,603,105

i am stoked that they are  potentially  returning to their old sound  d amp w is the best album they have done imo  it was also my gateway into becoming an army   and skool luv affair has so many bops on it  i mean obv it won t be exactly like their old stuff  i m internally cringing thinking about those outfits and hairstyles  but it ll be interesting to see how that sound will change w a matured bts  anyway i think it ll go over well w a western audience  there s a lot of millenials out there who love their 90 s early 00 s hip hop and r amp b   as for the younger audience  who knows  ,0,593,105

well  one of the things i absolutely love about bts is how diverse their discography is and how they don t hesitate to experiment with their sound and with different genres they always keep us on the edge of our seat guessing and anticipating what they will do next personally i am always excited about their music and this is not an exception   i love it already and will love it if their whole album is hip hop but   we have to remember that the songs of one of their albums are never the same and they usually genre hop inside the same album so it probably won t be all rap and hip hop  as for the gp considering mic drop is one of their most successful songs in the western market and among the gp and radio i think a hip hop album would do amazingly well the gp is really receptive to hip hop it would also set them apart from other popular musical acts because of their genre hopping and ability to pull everything off while remaining true to themselves and their style ,0,976,168

when the album title was revealed as  map of the soul   i immediately thought of epik high s albums  they had map of the human soul  2003   remapping the human soul  2007   and map the soul  2009   epik high was my favorite group back in the day so these connections make me feel extra giddy ,0,292,54

i expect them to continue to mix genres  ly involved all sorts of genres   i imagine this one well as well  also  musically  the intro isn t always connected to the title track  look at boy meets evil and bst  and epiphany and idol  so let s just all wait and see ,0,264,51
same here  i come in with wings and didn t check out their earlier work until ly tear was released  i didn t check it out until a bunch of beautiful people on this subreddit recommend i do  i still don t like rap hip hop in general  but the bts magic worked on  i definitely recommend checking out dark and wild  it s got a good mix of everything and a sort of bridging album between their more intense hip hop pop transition  favs are intro what am i to you  hip hop phile  embarrassed  let me know  rain  look here justin timberlake vibes imo   2nd grade      so literally the whole album  ,0,592,103
i m hoping this next album is mostly in that hip hop vibe  d amp w is still one of their albums i listen to on a daily basis  all the songs on it were on point  but what i ve learned with bts comeback is to not get tunnel vision on the theme of the upcoming album  the comeback for dna and idol had me presume it d have a certain sound but it didn t  so i ll just sit back for now and enjoy the waves  ,0,402,81

i feel like my prayers have been answered and big hit has finally responded with hip hop material via namjoon s intro to map of the soul  it think this ll force new army to go back in history and put the clues together as to the many throwback elements in the new intro aka school luv affair   bts and big hit are just soooo good at that  fighting ,0,348,68

i legitmately could care less about how other people could feel  the dark and wild era is how i got into bts and i have always felt like that time got kind of underrated as they got more successful  and i was cool with that because that sort of thing happens with every popular kpop group but if they re making a full return to it  break out the goddamn champagne because i m living for it ,0,390,75

bangtan was formed as a hip hop group  it is the core of the identity for them  and i dont think they ever slipped away but rather added to that identity  they added rnb  edm  bit of pop and rock  so i dont think there is a  throw back  as such  i feel we will see them re define and mix genres in this era as well  just like they have done so far  my favorite albums from them are dnw and tear   which are across two separate era s but what i like about both is the seamless blending of different music types to create great songs  and that is essentially bangtan   to me ,0,573,113

i think namjoon strongly hinted at sub units at the grammys  and maybe people should get used to the idea of sub units now so it won t be such a shock when they start enlisting ,0,177,35
 don t wanna judge anyone but i think is kinda strange you enjoy bts but don t like hip hop  i know that they use a lot of genres  but the main genre is hip hop  even in ly era  i don t think bts will stagnate with only one style genre and personally i really love them for doing that   amp  x200b  just what i wanted to say,0,324,64
this makes me realise how much i d love to see namjoon do a deconstructed with genius ,0,86,16
it s been a year since i graduated with my master s and i finally got a job offer in my field    it s kind of a boring job from what i know and i will probably be underpaid  but at least it s my foot in the door of the field  and way less exhausting than the overtime hours waitressing that i m doing now  ,0,306,61
we can never really predict which direct bts will go genre wise even after they drop the intro  remember we got epiphany and idol in the same era and the are nothing like each other genre wise  just cautioning against hype backlash   i like r amp b a lot and definitely love hiphop bangtan but i have never restricted myself to any genre so i will be excited no matter the genre they do   my theory is a different mater ,0,420,78
i love boy in luv  and if we get a song like that on this album i might lose my head,0,84,21
i love everything about sla era  and was during that time that i saw bts live for the first time so i have a lot of affection towards it  i really enjoyed the throwback at the beginning of the comeback trailer because i love sla s explosive intro ,0,247,47
i totally agree with your point about collaborations but i d like to see more of everyone together rather than sub units     for exactly the same reason  sub units will have to happen while people are away in the army so lets have everyone together while we can ,0,262,48

i m  really  excited  their hiphop roots is what made them become the one of the only kpop groups that i m really connected to  i ve seen ideas that they might be doing a rock concept and i would absolutely love that  i didn t know what to expect for this comeback but   yeah    also they had mic drop that they promoted pretty widely during ly era  i think most new armys would be familiar with that at least  ,0,411,76
oh my god,0,9,3
if it s sub units  that won t be a problem  if it s ot7  then i could see them collaborating with a dj  producer like zedd  pharrell or dj khalid  although we would have to put up with dj khalid screaming his name at the beginning of the song   ,0,245,48

that s always the icky thing with this list isn t it  it s supposed to highlight major influencers good and bad     but somehow it feels like recognizing them is also celebrating them and  maybe  feeding into that destructive narcissism  i always have mixed feelings about it ,0,276,45

i got into bts via dna and mic drop  which appealed to my love of both edm and hip hop  and then i was thrilled when i delved into their earlier stuff b c it s so heavily reminiscent of the 90s era hip hop and r amp b i was listening to when they were itty bitty bangtan  hi  kids  i m old   so i m very excited that this could be some modernized throwback stuff  but i m equally okay if they don t do that  i just want them to make the sound and music they like  i mean  there are songs i adore on every single album they ve released  so i don t feel like i m going to be disappointed  no matter what they put out  hell  they got me to love a song with  jazz flute  ,0,667,131

i m excited  if they re using jung  a review of past bangtan is probably essential for this persona album  in the podcast interview with murray stein  he said that we all have many legitimate personas     because we automatically adapt ourselves to the different roles we have to take on in life  we just naturally mirror the role models we see  but there are also times when we work too hard and change mold ourselves too much to fit expectations  so what is the essential  core  you  that underlies all of your personas  how do you learn who and what you really are  in order to know  understand and love yourself  and live an authentic life that is right and healthy for you  to start     you examine  1  your past  the person you were at many points in your life      2  all of your influences  people and situations that have shaped you and      3  all the roles and archetypes that make you  so  maybe they re going to revisit all of it     to arrive at the essential  core bangtan  theory a la jung and stein ,0,1016,186

while bts does  at time of post  a 25 75 poll between yes and no  do understand that most people on that list have a no majority lead with an average 20  margin  even donald glover  naomi osaka  beyonce  moon jae in and others have roughly the same percentages as them  among the few with a yes majority lead is michelle obama  and let s face it  no one can top michelle obama   so don t get discouraged by the numbers  after all  people s votes on time polls only account for a partial view on what ultimately gets on the magazine  that s in the hands of the editors themselves ,0,579,106
oh okay  ,0,9,2
i m not surprised tbh a few years ago the only people that knew bts were army s and people into kpop so if this pole came out then there would have probably been more  yes   but now they are well known i m pretty much every corner of the world a lot of people will have a more varied opinion on them  i love bts and voted yes but i think there are a lot of people on that list that deserve that cover more   like alexandria ocasio cortez  jacinda arden and greta thunberg ,0,472,92

i agree  their central theme has always been telling the story of them and sharing it with other people for comfort and personal reflection  that started in the school era  continued in hyyh  wings  and love yourself  i understand that some people prefer a certain sound from them but for me  every sound they ve experimented with carries their message  i became an army during the idol era  drawn in by the styles of i need u  bst  and fake love   i was never into hip hop but going through their older material made me appreciate their talent and the way they used it as a medium to convey their message  i look forward to bts going forth with whatever genre makes them comfortable ,0,684,123

it has begun  the style feels different  i m not sure about it but i don t hate it  this song was very   cheerful  a little less so in the middle  lyrics wise  but it picked up again at the end  though those things collapsing was a sudden disturbing note at the end   i m excited ,0,280,51
to be honest  i wouldn t take it as anything personal towards bts  the votes are supposed to be for who has changed the world the most  good or bad  and yet a lot of non american politicians celebrities influencers who have been hugely influential for all kinds of reasons are also getting majority  no  votes  i think the only one i spotted that was overwhelmingly positive was greta thunberg ,0,394,66

ah  okay ,0,9,2
i m extremely excited  as long as it s a fresh take  sign me up  we should also take into consideration that the album will be varied  they have hip hop  leaning  albums  r amp b  leaning  albums  edm  leaning  albums  etc  so while there is a dominant sound  i wouldn t even go as far to say their albums are specific to a genre  i have a theory that for many fans  their first series change is the hardest on them  half the fandom had a meltdown when dna was released  ,0,471,88
it s funny how one of suga s first songs was called  it doesnt matter  and later he has  nevermind   i guess he really does not give any fucks  huh,0,147,28

of course  the most important question lol  it was the first part where they are dancing in the intro that caught my eye  with the black shirt  jungkook  his aesthetics in everything else look very different to me  but that one visual of him looked really appealing  i m not sure why  i haven t seen him with the same look since  the disappointment is real   not saying the other guys aren t attractive  just that the one visual is what reeled me in for a second   ,0,465,84
agreed  i love ly series but now it s over and is time to move on  if they released something exactly like ly series again will be boring ,0,138,27
oh yeah i know about your site    i have no idea why i didn t think to use it lol i compiled it all myself,0,106,24
i originally got into it because of a friend who was is heavily army  this was when dna dropped and i really liked their sound and aesthetic  over time i grew to love them more and more  ly tear came out and i listened to it damn near every day i was so in love with it  ly answer came out during a really rough period of my life and helped me overcome some very tough issues in my life  i never understood what people meant by saying music  saved their life  until i listened to that message of loving yourself that bangtan was singing  i listen to them every day now and i just can t get enough of them  they re so authentic  lovable  and relatable that i m so happy i got into their music ,0,692,134
pfsh  denying hip hop is denying their identity  no more needs to be said  also  this is only one song out of their album  it s ok to not like the genre because there s something for everyone in every single one of their albums  they ve been doing this for years and will continue to infuse different genres so don t sweat it,0,325,60
i didn t even consider the not today connection  and the wormholes  darn it i will have to read it again while blasting nt in the background  just for fortification purposes  probably followed by persona    and we have the  mother  in the comeback trailer  and am actually curious if there are more of the archetypes and what army are finding  but yes maybe not today is some sort of big picture story of their journey  and like dna there s a reality through jungkook s eyes  an inside truth and an outside truth  and in the end aren t the ninjas clustered with them  not against them  i m glad i m not alone on the old man bully section  it was so specific and loaded  now talking about it maybe they are just symbolic of their foes but also who they could be  like jk is always fighting men like that but how easy would it be to become it  and same with tae  i don t know i m just spitballing  thank you for the compliment i don t feel good at all  but love speculating   what will this era mean  i wonder  so curious  also as to how literal  run i need u versus blood sweat and tears for example  the mvs will be  ,0,1117,207

i am not rap hip hop fans pre bts but weirdly i like to watch rap competition like show me the money and unpretty rapstar  lol  i just found its cool to watch  until when i start stanning bts  i realize how rap can move people heart too with their beats and lyrics  outro tear and cypher 4 are my most fave rap songs by bts along with suga first love  so  its mean i am still gonna listen to the album despite it being rap hip hop heavy  and i always love and appreciate how experimental bts can be  and for me  their core is their lyrics and message which consistently being convey since day 1  so  i am really looking forward for their upcoming album  ,0,654,124
i suspect she and a few others might release a single with them  but not included in the actual album  i m not saying that it s bad to include joint songs  but historically bts has always kept their albums pure bts  and i think for good reason ,0,244,46

like someone else said  hip hop has always been a big part of bts  dark and wild was my absolute favourite and i m so glad they re going back to their roots as such  i m so pleased for them  in a way it may even do us some good since it might weed out  no pun intended  the people who only view   like them for being pretty kpop idols  know what i mean  either way  i m so excited to see where this new era will take us ,0,420,86
i am so ready for it    i love d amp w era and miss their hiphop stuff  but i love almost all genres so it s fine with me    ,0,125,27
this is perfectly said  yes  their parents are abstractions in a way  almost as much as the women their anima are  and it s almost like they drift through this foggy  grey life and the other boys are the only bright lights in the darkness  but they re so choked and consumed by that miasma that it keeps pushing them apart  and they have to become their own lights before they can find each other  i m so impatient to see more and understand what the next steps are and who taehyung and jungkook are becoming  ,0,510,92

i for one am excited  i officially got in on this fandom in mid 2015  so i missed the debut train  i m excited to potentially experience a polished enhanced version of it  i also wonder if all of the hints to the whole past recently means that they are going to revisit their hyyh styles as well  even though they aren t as discernible as debut  but i just love this whole direction regardless ,0,394,73

this is amazing  more than i expected from a trailer ,0,53,10
i m one of those people who has been around since debut so this is all very nostalgic for me  dark and wild is one of my favorite albums  with that being said  i don t really expect every song to be hip hop  bts has shown their versatility over the years and even though i think they will always have hip hop roots  i can t imagine them abandoning the newer sounds entirely  i genuinely haven t been disappointed by any of their albums though so i m not worried  as far as how the general public reacts  we ll see  tbh  everyone seems so impressed by their hard work  message  genuine talent and impact so i think it s going to go well either way  i m not too worried about how the public feels anyway  i want to enjoy this with other fans and the boys ,0,753,141

since mic drop was their most successful song on us radio  i think it will go over great ,0,89,18
i m actually really excited  i live for hiphop and r amp b bangtan so i m stoked  as for the general public i don t know  they re one of the top groups in korea and one album probably won t change that  as for international audiences  not sure about the rest of the world but the us is really into hip hop  if anything i believe it ll go over pretty well ,0,355,66

the korean is actually lyrics from  intro  skool luv affair   namely the song we hear at the beginning and that was in  skool luv affair  comeback trailer\^\^ dream  happiness and love are actually the themes of the school trilogy  respectively for  2 cool 4 skool    o rul8 2   and  skool luv affair   but it does look like they re going to revisit them in this new series  sidenote though because it seems a lot of people don t realize it  these have actually been bangtan s main themes all along their discography  especially the dream  it was central in  hyyh pt 2  concept  papillon  and it was also the main subject in  paradise   they constantly turn around these three themes  it s just more or less explicit depending on the album   don t think i ll update this comment  unless it s a big discovery  but i ll add everything i find on [this post]  ,0,856,144
i m really excited  i got into bts around the wings era but have of course gone back and listened to everything  it s a big piece of their history and i love  love their more hip hop songs and am such a huge rap line fan at this point  this might be a little weird but i remember an interview with queen  where they mentioned they never put themselves into a specific genre and that was okay  i see bts the same way   they have so many songs that  fit  into all different genres  but ultimately they re all bts songs ,0,517,100
omfg when i asked for guitars in the predictions thread i absolutely did not expect this  specially not this led zep flavor     i love it so much  they seem to have mixed in some of my favorite bits from their past intros  even youth  aaah    i could just cry with how special it feels  quite the journey  dudes  and joon    our president is so cool  the coolest  ,0,364,68
my first comeback was tear  but i saw dna when it was performed at the amas  i love their old sound even though i never liked hiphop rap before  im excited for the high energy  less poppy  bts ,0,193,37
i ve been a fan of bts since 2015  and all i can say is that this is what i was really hoping for  i ve always preferred their r amp b hip hop songs over the newer sound they ve had  not to say the new stuff is bad  it s just not really my style   love is not over will always be one of my favorite songs  and i really hope to see more of that ,0,344,70
everytime bts drops something there are people that are not satisfied  when hyyh era began hip hop fans were disappointed  when bts started doing edm  hyyh wings era fans were disappointed  some fans stopped being fans  but a lot of people became fans as well  just going to have to accept that not everyone will like what direction they do  but doing different things allows bts to reach a wider audience and it makes them happy  also  a lot of people attribute 2013 2014 to the  hip hop years  but those albums were a mix of genres and more complex then people are giving them credit for  also i think this will be hip hop from a less um   inauthentic place  it will be about their love for the genre and not putting on an act ,0,729,133
im looking for 3 tickets for wembley night one  possibly level 1 2  would mean a lot,0,84,16
i m so excited it s not even funny  lol  i became a fan after ly  her and it took me a while to get into their more hip hop based music because i ve honestly never been much of a fan of hip hop  i eventually came to love it as much as i loved their more pop y stuff  though  and despite not being a fan for long  a little over a year now  i found myself wanting them to revisit their old sound quite a lot  so this  this makes me incredibly happy ,0,447,90
just about everyone has some degree of a  no  score  maybe they choose the few  yes  and the least bad  no   ,0,109,22
i don t know if it s ignorant of me  but i typically don t spend much time thinking about the gp reaction  i believe that when they make their music with sincerity and create the way they want to create  it will continue to appeal to people  of course i love seeing them soar and reach bigger audiences  but for me it s more enjoyable to see artistic growth  good art doesn t always appeal to a big population  they may end up doing something that doesn t appeal to the masses but has artistic merit and is true to what they want to express  that will always have its audience and that s what i personally prioritize  i m  slightly  apprehensive about calling back to previous work too much  i much prefer exploring new territory instead of endlessly re examining the past  some artists turn inwards to fixate on past successes and do overs as kind of a swan song  however  i have trust in them to keep doing it in a way that helps them evolve  so i m still on board this nostalgia trip we ve been on for a while  there s really no sign of stagnation in it  anyway  their albums are always a good mix of sounds  i m here for all the ways their interests are evolving and expanding  i m sure the upcoming album will be another interesting bag of things too  i m a rapline hoe and prefer their bangers hiphop tracks  i m probably good based on this ,0,1347,241
i m really excited  both because i m a huge hip hop fan who adores bangtan s earlier releases and really wants to see them dip into that style again with more maturity and all the skills and knowledge they now possess  but also hip hop is definitely the trendy genre where i live so i think the reception here at least will be great  if anyone who isn t a hip hop fan is feeling a little disappointed or nervous that they won t like this album i think that s okay  just remember that bts has a huge discography and they aren t done making music yet  they love to jump genres and try new things so it probably won t be long before they re releasing stuff that s more your taste again  and until then there s no shame in listening to the albums of theirs that you do like  i know there s often an expectation that if you stan a group you should love literally everything they ever release  and sometimes it works out that way  but sometimes it doesn t and i don t think you should be considered less of a fan for that  ,0,1017,188
hi  my reddit dm seems to be acting up  i opened up my twitter dm s so if you could utilize that please  thank you  ,0,116,24
i m laughing at the accuracy of namjoon mannequins  long limbs ,0,63,10
dark  amp  wild is one of my favourite albums so i would be so  stoked  if they actually did something similar for this album  i m a huge hiphop r amp b fan so i actually have a slight preference for their older stuff and the more hiphop leaning tracks of the ly era albums  they ve gone with a more public friendly sound with the last era and i think they ll keep going in that direction  but i have a feeling they might try to blend some more of their original sound in there  i mean  i really don t think whatever they ve got cooked up will be that big of a departure  not enough to alienate a lot of people anyway  i have faith in their production team lol  they haven t let us down yet  imo  holy shit i suck at expressing myself  how do people do this,0,757,143
i am excited  i wasn t a hiphop fan before bts but they made me appreciate hiphop to the point i checked out other artist and their work  we still don t know for sure if the plan on going full og or not but i am excited either way  even though it s old school bangtan  it s an ungraded version  it has the polish they have now and the great lyrics but still the fun they always were  i think the gp will get to experience another side of bangtan and will come to appreciate them even more  i have this theory which i hope is correct but i feel that with this comeback and era they are just not discussing our map of soul  they are also making bangtan s map of the soul musically so i think this album will be their 13 14 era  and the shadow will be hyyh and wings era like and then the last ego will be ly era like  so this theory is correct then the newer fans who don t like hiphop much will have their era soon enough  there time will also come ,0,948,188
yup  we already dont get  enough  of all 7 u really want a feature to come in and basically take up a quarter of the song lol,0,125,27
i am thrilled  i am a pre debut army so it may be a bit different for me but it was that sound  that concept  that hardness that got me into them and kept me with them all this time  i ve seen both gp reactions  but most of it is positive  they understand and welcome the bangtan roots because without it   we wouldn t be here  i m ready for whatever bangtan throws at us and even if i m not too fond of the title tracks  dna anyone   i learn to like it and know that other tracks on the album will appeal to me because come on  bangfreakin tan  i love that bts is so versatile  they will play with their sounds yet always never really managing to stray too far from their roots and their signature styles  cheers to us all  may we all survive this comeback ,0,758,144
that s amazing  thanks so much ,0,31,5
namjoon is cool  jimin  i totally agree     ,0,44,8
bangtan have matured a lot since their earlier hip hop albums and i think that s important to keep in mind  even if they do return to their  old sound  i don t think it would be the same for that reason  they just don t need to go around saying  swag  all the time anymore to seem legit  personally i hope this album is a bit less straightforward than just  hip hop  since their strong point has always been mixing genres and coming up with new sounds  with hip hop at its core  ,0,479,91
yeah i don t understand why people are always wanting the albums to be anything but just bts  especially with all the line distribution issues we already have  ,0,160,27

that s my king,0,14,3
excited       d amp w is their best album  sla was also one of the best  those eras also had a lot more cohesiveness and explosive energy and i think it will be awesome to have that with their maturer and more confident selfs    koreans know bil  when you see new korean reactors   fans listen to those eras they thoroughly enjoy them  so i don t think a hybrid of that era will go badly with them  as for the west  idc what they think  as music is stale and repetitive and if that s what they want  they ll pick it regardless of what bts presents  what i need to see is army a 110  behind this album and the direction they are taking  i personally have many issues with ly era  especially tear   answer and have come across a ton of people who don t really feel it as well  but we ve supported them completely and found put silver linings in all of it and i hope the same is done this era  pls none of the crap with shitting on dna for example  that was ugly and gave fodder to antis  don t do that  it s disrespectful to bts and just plain nasty  don t like anything  cool  express it in a mature manner and then move on  ,0,1124,214

my second comeback  here we go ,0,31,6
i m really excited  i became a fan during d amp w so this is exactly the type of sound i signed up for  i ve been missing it a lot lately  despite this  i m sure their album would have more gp friendly songs if they went this route  especially as single and some for vocal line  that said  just because the intro sounds like this doesn t mean the whole album will  i m still   at them  i don t trust  i ll only believe when listening ,0,434,81

hello op  my friends and i also made a compilation of sorts  the [bts timeline]   since their debut  i also [posted about it here on the sub]   a while back too  it s a lot though  not just the comeback content  but majority of it are still the teasers  tracklists  mvs  etc  maybe it might help with the links for the eras before young forever in the compilation page  i ve been trying to update it monthly now so the content won t be as overwhelming to upload one by one   i ll upload the march update before the month ends as promised     lol i wish i could ve had this page when i was trying to update our timeline as well hahaha  i ll cross check your links with the ones we uploaded on our site  we might have missed a few  thank you for compiling this     ,0,763,143

the thing is those armys should know and accept that hip hop has always been a big part of bts and it s their roots,0,115,24
i m so excited  i got into bts with sla era and d amp w is still my favorite album from them  i teared up hearing that sample from intro  sla in the new song  it was serious nostalgia for me and i m so excited at a possible return to that sound  ,0,246,49
the album that got me into bts was skool luv affair  that s answer everything  don t wanna judge anyone but i think is kinda strange you enjoy bts but don t like hip hop  i know that they use a lot of genres  but the main genre is hip hop  even in ly era  i don t think bts will stagnate with only one style genre and personally i really love them for doing that ,0,363,71

as someone who got into them  d amp w  that era has a special place in my heart anyway  but i also just love their sound  for their newer albums there s usually a couple songs i ll start skipping after a while but when it comes to their 2013 2014 stuff i never skip a single song  so yeah  i would probably just instantaneously combust out of pure happiness if they include some more throwback  if they do  i m not too worried about the reception  in korea  hip hop and rap has been very popular these past couple years  and in the west it s also become very mainstream  not to mention  western critics love versatility  so bts switching up their sound a little would probably be well received  ,0,695,123

i pretty much posted the same theory in the comments for the mv post both here and  which i assume got lost lol  copy paste time again   i have a feeling that they will go this way for genres persona  2013 14 early hiphop bangtan shadow  2015 16 hyyh era   wings era genre  ego  2017 18 ly era genre  also this tweet inspired me    it saw persona  dream shadow  love ego happiness written somewhere on the mv  the genre bit is the extra part  if bts is making map of the soul of their own soul then this is how i assume their musical journey to be portrayed  just a theory ,0,573,108

i just wanna scream out into the void i love how old school this is i love that the lyrics read as if they came right from joon s brain onto paper i love that he s actually addressing the concept they re presenting its not really vague and broad the lyrics are directly addressing the complexity of self identity i love the rock influence w  the guitar and the reference to school love affair and the relevance that has to the concept of self identity and persona considering how far joon has come and changed since that time and i love that this seems so much like a song and an mv that only joon could truly pull off with this sort of energy  amp  x200b  anyway  i feel like the song could ve hit harder but it s still growing on me so i can t really make much judgement on it yet beyond the stuff i m sure of above,0,817,155

at around 2 00  he starts rapping with his head and eyes up  then you see the titan with him  at that point in the song  he starts saying  me  in almost every line  and directly making statements about himself  rather than questioning or bitterly recalling the past  also  the titan is in a robe  rather than clothing  which is a metaphor for purity or nakedness  they can t depict a naked rm  whatever fans may want       he bends down and looks at rm with curiosity and leans forward for a closer look  i think the titan is namjoon observing rm  i don t mean to get too philosophical  but it s said philosophy is the study of the mind studying itself  in terms of perception  every person has their  version  of every other person they know  and then their  own version  of themselves  which is separate from every other person s version of the same person  robed  naked namjoon  his actual mind  or self awareness  is studying himself  and the rm  himself  is speaking back to the namjoon studying and perceiving rm ,0,1019,177

two hours later and i ve finally regained  some  composure and gather my thoughts  i was not ready for this  at all  12am korea time thursday meant 8am wednesday where i live  and that s basically the time my day officially starts  fortunately it s my day off from work today  so i am able to fangirl properly     i was just thinking yesterday about how it s been  that kind  of week for army as far as new releases goes  mattel dolls  first look at uno cards   crying over you by honne feat beka  rm   and i pondered since they didn t air an episode of run  it felt like an eerie anticipation for what will come on the next day  wednesday    which now led us to this trailer  they really come at you with a punch  don t they   it s my first official comeback  and i m still reeling from everything from this video  my twitter feed right now has been flooding with observations and theories coming true  but i m feeling so attacked  because kim namjoon is my bias  and  just  damn  everything about this near three minutes trailer was so visually perfect  so well executed  i love the nostalgic  throwback feel of it  that early 90s hip hop that i grew up with  it s also strange even for a short video  it makes you think about who you were in the past versus who you are now  i m still figuring out who i am and what i want to do in life  i think even the older we get  we re still a work in progress  no matter whatever trials and tribulations we go through  i m forever grateful for bts entering my life at the time they did  and i m very much excited for what s to come   i just need to manage my time during this comeback for the next few weeks ,0,1651,307

theories  1  there is a quote by carl jung on the blackboard  and it says   the dream is the small hidden door in the deepest and most intimate sanctum of the soul  which opens to that primeval cosmic night that was soul long before there was conscious ego and will be soul far beyond what a conscious ego could ever reach   2  there is another quote by carl jung on the blackboard  and it says   i am not what happened to me  i am what i choose to become   3  there is a quote from wizard of oz on namjoon s jacket  and it says   pay no attention to the man behind the curtain   4   happiness  is written on random places  and i knew it was relating to the concept  they had mentioned it too many times in award shows and random places where it felt like a hint  5   who am i  who are you   is from an award show vcr 6   dreams  are written on random places  again  knew this was relating ever since they tweeted so many random  dream  songs that it didn t feel like a random coincidence ,0,989,190

okay  as you know  bts have ale written about whatever phases they were going through and during their earlier years  most of them were still teenagers  well i ll start with intro skool luv affair since this song samples it and what am i to you  also [tomorrow ]   is a fan favourite for a reason  since you like tear  well before there was tear  there was [cypher part 3]   which if you watched the armypedia event you will know that it s like army s favourite hype anthem  the video i linked was a kcon fan cam so you ll know how crazy it is that they performed a random b side from a year and a half back and everyone knew the lyrics  also  it s not talked about that often but before there was hope world  there was [1 verse]   other similar songs would be we on and intro 2 kook for skool if you like their crazier songs  [spine breaker]   is really good and it also has a hilarious bangtan made home video  i also like look here and second grade  i think i will just recommend the entire dark and wild album  another crazy but educational one would be paldogongsang  satoori rap  which actually inspired an upcoming variety show  if you like their softer songs  people seem to like just one day but my personal favourites are rain and like  i m sorry  i m trying to keep it minimal so i don t overwhelm you but honestly i would say just give all the albums a go just one day when you are free  you might be surprised at how good it actually is  source  i wasn t much of a hip hop fan either and i got into them through the unhiphop blood sweat n tears,0,1557,294

whenever other kpop idols ended up in a controversy  the fans always used     but namjoon  to refer to the problematic stuff rm did  he apologised for all this but some people still use it although not so much  to make themselves feel better ,0,242,43
[it s a reference to this]   basically people use rms past mistakes to downplay the current mistakes of other kpop stars,0,120,20
i wonder if the styling is also a throwback to their earlier looks  the white shirt with a chain reminds me of o rul82 ,0,119,23
i m so in love  i m so delighted by how the boys refuse to stagnate musically  the punk vibe is really fresh  and i love how joonie sounds here  he can hit hard  but he has more maturity now than he did when he was mowing through bars in rm and early cyphers  he s always been talented  but the growth is huge  i m so proud ,0,324,64
forgive me for not properly putting my thoughts together  but i m at a loss for words at the moment  i had no idea the trailer  soon song  would hit me that hard  a little background as to why  intro  skool luv affair is one of my top 3 bts songs   that really says a lot  they ve got a lot of heaters   amp amp  if you haven t connected already  they ve got it mixed in the new song  i ve also been following bts since 2014  so i have a lot of history with them  too boring to explain   granted i wasn t following them as closely as i started to in 2016 because of    reasons   high school needed my attention  but anyways  what i m trying to say is  wow  they really took me back  i didn t think i d feel like this  till 10 years from now  amp amp  i d hear answer  love yourself out of nowhere or something  ly tour was my first bts concert  i have feelings for it   i definitely recommend listening to  if you haven t already  intro  skool luv affair or even just watching the trailer for it   amp amp  watching the persona trailer afterwards  it ll give you a semblance of the journey i m sure rm was trying to convey he went through  amp amp  his feelings on it  because i sure did  i texted my husband as soon as i saw it   amp amp  started gushing about how much i was feeling  considering it felt like i was standing face to face with my past self   amp amp  thanking her  amp amp  understanding the solid fact that the past me  amp amp  the present me really are the same  the reason i am who i am  is because of my past me   amp  the choices i made from then on  is the reason the present me is who i am today  rm made me realize this in one song   like wth man  i don t know if it s because i ve had past history with them  or if i just understand what it is that they re trying to convey  whichever it is  i m really here for it  personally  i think that when they said it ll be a more  organic  album sound this time  they maybe mean a mash up of their old sound  amp amp  their present sound  their sound from back then  kind of improved on  amp amp  polished with what they ve learned since then  regardless of the hodgepodge of feelings that are running through me at the moment  it s still at face value  an amazing song   you are welcome to feel otherwise  music preference is subjective  but it s definitely going to be a fan attractor  a k a be ready for another influx of new fans  this isn t new really   the video was attractive  visuals were great  i can see it aging well as well  this is when you hear it again at a later date  it s even better   amp  as always  his delivery is perfect  my husband always says he swears he knows korean when rm raps  because you just really do understand him   language is never a barrier when it comes to great artists  the song is a hit  so  yeah  i m really stoked for the new album  thoughts  ,0,2858,530

that none of this is real and it s just seokjin watching mvs   a reality   ,0,75,16
i had to pull an all nighter for work one night and naturally i sought out distractions  my brother was letting me use his youtube tv account and saw the burn the stage series pop up  i m korean american  never really got super into kpop and my mom would always go on about bts and why i couldn t bring home a guy like seokjin so i wanted to know what all the fuss was about  i was drawn in to burn the stage because i was so used to the k variety shows with the subtitles sound effects replays and had never really seen an  intimate  or  real  looking docu about kpop stars  their authenticity drew me in  then i stayed up until 6am not working and watching a billion more videos  those bts in america ones  i thought jungshook at normani s performance at billboard was so cute and i loved jin s dad jokes  the mvs that hooked me were bst  save me and war of hormone  ,0,869,164
i m late  anyway  the intro for school luv affair is criminally underrated and the whole album has a special place in my heart  they were right  we really didn t expect this  kim namjoon is our president for a reason ,0,217,39
he knows what  ,0,15,3
true  true  but here s hoping ,0,30,5
if he doesn t perform this masterpiece at the stadium tour i ll riot  ,0,70,12
lol i thought i was the only one this is too good,0,49,12
how freaking fortuitous    i have been away on vacation for about a week and have also tried to stay off  unplugged from social media so it s perfect timing that the day i fly back home the trailer drops     in the back of my mind i wanted the trailer to be kinda like nevermind with the animations  surprised i was kinda right for once lol rapline back at it again with the intros woop woop    comeback time let s get it ,0,422,80
nice work  i think it s really handy to see what kind of time frame bighit have worked with in the past ,0,104,21
i know  don t worry   ,0,22,5
 gt  this will get buried but has anyone else realised there are 7 previous eras  7 members of bangtan     bruh you just blew my fucking mind,0,141,26
yesyesyes i ve been waiting for hiphop bangtan for such a long time  since dark and wild school luv affair  my prayers have finally been answered  i have watched this at least 20 times  hopefully the rest of the album will follow in this hiphop style because i am loving it ,0,274,49
[i wish i saw your post before posting tt ]   ,0,46,10
my first comeback let s get it,0,30,6
the fact that jimin [gave us a hint all this time]   also cackling that [this was played at the armypedia event]   they re such schemers  ,0,138,24
i need to take the time to dive into the lyrics  it s so good   i m so excited for what s coming ,0,97,21
i actually saw that as soon as i hit post  thanks man  i ll leave a link to my two cents  this post  under there as well  much love  thanks for looking out  ,0,157,32
i use to not be interested in their earlier albums but i watched their live performances for their early songs like we are bullet proof part 2 and fell in love with the old songs and all i do is listen to their older songs now  i prefer live versions because it adds a different feeling to a song for me  maybe try looking up their older songs being performed live  ,0,366,71
 but namjoon  went from a shade to a brag lmao i love it  king is back  he s seriously so attractive it s unfair    and what if we re getting a rock oriented album   ,0,166,31
omg  this is everything     i can t with how great that beat is  thank you  namjoon  you are king ,0,98,18
we can t really say how the whole album will sound like but intro does give a direction and it s definitely directing towards that  what i said above is just my random theory so it can definitely turn out to be wrong ,0,217,41
yo  that is such a cool theory   it would be so neat if they did this ,0,70,16
that was quick,0,14,3

wait    this is a teaser    this slaps  if it s a teaser  will there be more  ahhhhhhhh,0,87,16
just please lord  give a sexy 90s slow jam ,0,43,9
this reminds me of old school bangtan  his flow omg  and the lyrics    it s so introspective and very on brand with the theme  and great visuals too  i love the aesthetic of the video  king namjoon slaps so hard  ,0,213,39
this is sick as hell  omg  i m so in love ,0,42,10
why am i at work now   it s gonna suck waiting all day,0,54,12
oh man  lol  you bet i will though  ,0,36,8
for the most representative music of bts  i would recommend the hyyh era  so basically i need u  then prologue  then run and as final young forever  the themes in this era is youth  and coming to grips with growing up  it is probably the era where the most fans were had  i recommend first listening to those 4 songs in order  and if you like it listen to the hyyh albums  ,0,373,72
good lord  hip hop bangtan might make a comeback    but instead of teenage angst now we have that good old adult suave,0,118,22
i m hyped but still rational lol i love the trailer  so far their trailers have always been very good  and i just love to see the rapline back at it again  namjoon s trailer has very good vibes and that s coming from someone who doesn t like hiphop that much  the lyrics are topnotch too,0,287,53
don t even worry about it  lol  i couldn t place it either because i always skip the intro myself though i do listen to their old stuff about as much as i do their new stuff  ,0,175,35
i got the notification for this while i was driving so i pulled over to watch it    so freaking worth it  ahhhh i m so excited for this comeback  ,0,146,29
me tooo  i always forget the comeback trailer is actually a whole song of its own  comeback season has that effect on the brain  ,0,129,25
i suggest you do a full discography listen start to finish  you can t ignore who they were and the roots that they themselves have never left behind and are still present in all albums ,0,185,34

 maybe that s a hint   you can never be sure with bh  d,0,55,12
ok your comment made me feel better  i love the first 3 you mentioned  those are      sure  always open to recs  ,0,113,23
oh my goodness the same thing happened to me and i thought i was the only one and then on top of freaking about this video i was just freaking out about it not working  so then i was spiralling  like what if it just doesn t come back for the whole come back season  where will i spill all my thought and to who  then what  i m fine now  so so relieved it started working,0,370,75
yeah  it sounds like an old soul record but pitched up significantly  it s very much right for the style of the original skool luv affair track to sample an old soul or r amp b track  thanks for clarifying   ,0,208,38
i will require a five foot clearance around me because i will being going  off  ,0,80,15
yes yes yes  have all my yes namjoon  i can t wait to see what this album brings now  that i hear a snippet from the past reborn,0,128,27

understandable  i was so overwhelmed i couldn t really make out what am i watching  i kept thinking why is it a trailer but it s a whole mv  this is not my first comeback  i actually know that they release the intro as a music video  but my brain wasn t really working ,0,269,51
at work  i meet with a student who loves bts every wednesday at lunch and im so excited to show her this  president kim namjoon did not have to to go this hard for a teaser  i couldn t stop smiling the whole time   ,0,215,44
rest assured  i was shaking and   heavy breathing   not breathing at all and tearing up when i watched it at 12 01 kst but reddit was down so now i had time to process everything so i can deliver you my thoughts calmly  dear fellow armys  ok so what the fuck namjoon  the sound is oldschool yet high quality and funky and catchy at the same time  lyrics are  based on yt subtitles  hitting me hard and strenghten my wish to be like namjoon  my idol  my role model  only thing is the biblical references  not sure what to think about those hmmm  visuals tho  he s so confident  so grown up  so so  so  so beautiful  i basically screenshotted the whole mv and sent it to my army friend  his eyes  i tell you    and it looks like he s wearing visvim style clothes  it feels very casual joonie but then at 1 52 he s casual hip hop rm and \[rest\]  btw love the animations  same as txt s  crown   good job bighit  if the album will be oldschool  hip hop bangtan but polished and evolved and visually modern     whispers  maybe    grammy ,0,1032,188
ok  i would love this  ,0,23,5
did you like mic drop  outro her  outro tear or ddaeng  because of you did  you re good  they never completely abandoned their hip hop roots just like they won t completely abandon their new style ,0,197,34
not that  i think the op is asking what was actually used for sampling even in the original skool luv affair ,0,109,21
i approve of this,0,17,4
do you know when people were speculating and hoping for the style this album would be going towards and was really hoping for something similar to their hiphop rnb days and even with this i feel like that has been satisfied  it would be great if the whole album would be like that,0,280,52
i am not sure what you actually want to talk about but if it s your feelings about the song then i would advice you to wait a bit and let it rest  hype backlash is a thing and there is also the fact that all of us have made all these predictions and perception of what this comeback could sound like and when it doesn t sound like how we in visioned it we get disappointed even though it s humanly impossible to satisfy every vision of every fan for any artist  so if you are overwhelming and don t know how you feel then i suggest you take a break  both from the internet and from the song  don t think about it and give it time and comeback to it when you feel like it  that will help you judge better ,0,704,138
      i m so excited  this is my first comeback and this is so much more than i expected from the first teaser  ahhhh,0,117,23
i was in my work office talking to a colleague when this dropped  i closed the door and made her watch it with me  trying to keep my cool while watching a bleach blonde rm remixing one of their old tracks was a struggle    amp  x200b  dark and wild  and skool luv affair were what drew me to bts  i am so excited for this comeback   also  makes me think jimin s tattoo is  actually  for comeback reasons ,0,404,76
you give me    ,0,15,3
i usually dont  fanboy  or go crazy over their mv s but just smile and enjoy  but i swear this time i could not hold back  rm is my bias  and this is so fucking great  everything about it  i feel like it is a much lighter spring y vibe than his sadder and deeper stuff from mono  but still certainly in the iconic rm style  the mv is sooo chill  and not too overproduced like a lot of recent mv s of theirs has been imo  also loved the cribbly effects they used  sort of the same thing as in the txt video  but in a different style  can t wait for the album      ,0,563,111

oh my god it s 100  my style  this is actually so good  it s like early 90 s hip hop and irobot had a child,0,107,23
honest opinion  mixed feelings  i m a new army and i don t know any of their earlier albums  because i simply don t like their hiphop era  i was a little scared going into this comeback they would bring that style back       i fell inlove with them through ly  so i hoped it would be that style  i m still open minded and anxiously waiting for the whole album to drop    ,0,371,70
everytime i listen to namjoon s songs  i feel like i am taking a journey through his mind and it honestly amazes me,0,115,22
yo  i thought i was gonna get a snippet of some music  but it s a whole video of my boo bear namjoon    omg  ok  i need to breathe     he looked so fucking sure of himself  i can t right now with this boy  confidence was oozing out of him  and that shit was sexy as fuck  lord help me  i am not ready for this comeback  if they are going back to hip hop  i might legit die  this song was so good  the beat  yas jesus  i m so not prepared for what is to come ,0,458,95
man that was a stressful past hour  firstly i leave the house for maybe an hour or so to come back and see this    for some reason i completely glossed over the fact that and intro video comes out first and was not read for this  and oh my goodness i love the song    it has an old school vibe to it and i also really love the animations and animatron things later on  the lyrics feel very much like rm  very thoughtful and introspective but also with a playfulness to them which is just so nice  sheesh but the stressful part of all this is that i just need top spill all this out somewhere and my reddit just wasn t working for like half an hour  of all the times to not be working it chose just when i video was released  but now i can finally take a breathe,0,761,151
namjoon s flow     namjoon s bars     namjoon s everything     he looks and sounds so freaking good i was actually screaming at certain parts of the video  the best rapper in the industry  the cyphers and ddaeng have a new member  let s all welcome  but namjoon  into the club  this is so exciting  i m still trying to process the rest of that video  persona is already a damn masterpiece  wooooohhhhh boy ,0,406,67

the way i screamed once that notif hit tho     no lie im getting so excited with this theme  how poetic is it that namjoon shows us his persona as rm in this intro  aaaa i can t wait for the title track now  i love self aware and woke bangtan so much  so much growth and rawness in what they do,0,294,60
lol   its a bone  false alarm  haha amazing,0,43,8
can someone id what track this   the original intro  skool luv affair samples  the  you give me love  part  stan twitter thinks it s a bts orig  of course they do  but i m sure it s a sample of an american track  probably soul or 90s 2000s hip hop  anyone  thanks   it s going to kill me again this second time around ,0,318,59
this is so different  but familiar at the same time   like  it s refreshing in a new way  but the way the song was produced  and obv  the classroom  harkens back to their first albums  so hyped to see what this new album has in store for us   ,0,243,47

i m not all the way caught up so i can t say about later episodes  but the early issues on line app naver don t have music  having said that   i have read a webtoon before that had a soundlink to click to listen to while reading  a horror comic   so it s not a thing that s never done  i d encourage you to read on the original app website  if you can afford it  because the art is designed for continuous scrolling specifically which really adds to the tension  ,0,463,84
i m a new ish army  this is my first comeback  namjoon is my bias  i am overwhelmed  ,0,85,16

i m seriously impressed by this  for one  i m super excited to see intro  skool luv affair again  the animation and the song are timeless and should have been experienced by more people when they came out  bangtan was always so good  and the sample holds up still  the rap is autobiographical poetry  it s introspective  questioning  challenging  and vulnerable  and namjoon ends his rap with telling the world that he just wanted to comfort us  i had a very strong emotional response to this  i also love the rock guitar throughout  the titan namjoon  and the throwback to the classroom  in this one video we have both the origins of the bulletproof boyscouts and the titans they ve become ,0,691,117

this is awesome  nice flow   i m kind of assuming going kind of back to their hip hop roots back in their early era  nice concepts as well  i m seeing some subtle political undertones and literature allusions  sci fi  there   okay  don t come at me  but why the wall reminds me of that  build a wall   yea you know   ,0,317,54

the most recent era just ended in august  as you can imagine  we re all somewhat hyperventilating as it draws nearer  the eras are  school trilogy  examining  and often critiquing  different aspects of school life  they had a lot to say about the korean educational system and class inequality  3 albums  dark and wild  more of a hip hop sound  a lot of reflecting on society and who they are as burgeoning artists  1 album  the most beautiful moment in life  examining the transition in your twenties from youth to adulthood   3 albums  wings  reflection of oneself and dealing with struggles of greed and temptation  loosely based around herman hesse s novel damian  each member also wrote a solo song about their individual struggle  2 albums  love yourself  more narrative  follows the various stages of love  ultimately ending in grief and realizing that the only true love is self love   3 albums  map of the soul  upcoming     it looks like they re going to follow the progression of the different parts of jung s book map of the soul  there are also japanese albums  mostly existing songs translated into japanese with a few new original japanese songs thrown in there  and unofficial songs released on their soundcloud  sometimes they fit in with the era  sometimes they re standalone  but they re all beautiful nonetheless  i think it may have already been mentioned  but three of the members have also released solo albums  one of them has released two  which are all masterpieces  each era has a very distinct sound as well  so i d say pick one that appeals to you and listen through with one of the recommended translators    ,0,1639,274
it s funny because i  always  read comments even if it s just a quick glance and for all the complaints about bts fans spamming comment sections  i don t recall ever seeing them mentioned until that day so afterwards it was a shock to realize we actually are in almost every comment section  the only conceivable explanation is that i must have literally thought people were talking about the military  ,0,403,68

i see that too  especially the one titled  bts being extra af in america  with suga s picture as a thumbnail  i personally feel like for kpop idols  a big part of the appeal is also the personality  they almost never just sing  dance   rap  go to award shows and take some interviews  they also regularly go on reality tv shows  game shows  talk shows etc that showcases as many sides of themselves as they can  maybe it s because many people find that to be more endearing and hence more intriguing in that sense  ,0,515,94
that s amazing thanks for telling me ,0,37,6
it really is  actually a new era is about to begin  its based on carl jung s philosophy  at least the name seems to indicate that   they will release a new album which will be the first of its era called map of the soul  persona on 12 april ,0,241,48
all my life i only listened to rock  i had heard of people reading anime or watching k drama  but i d always pretty much laugh it off  saying i could never imagine myself getting into something so culturally different  so when my friends started brainwashing me into liking bts  i was very prejudiced against them  but after a couple of months i gave in and watched a few of their us interviews  which made me appreciate rm s high iq  and then i watched their mvs and realized how hardworking they must be to achieve such results  and also how they really seem to be working as a team  which differentiates them from the much more selfish western artists   amp  x200b ,0,668,118

 watching youtube mv and it auto played fire steve aoki remix mv  it had a good beat and one of the members looked so good in the video and i watched a few more but couldn t identify the hottie in subsequent mvs  was surprised they changed their looks so frequently and drastically  did some digging and got interested in how they made themselves so available through videos etc but have since found that to be super common in the kpop industry  ruining the uniqueness of that experience  watched an expose doc on kpop and then felt bad for supporting the industry  now i follow this sub and their twitter and call it a day  a lot of mixed feelings  ,0,650,118
oh i understand  i d like to add that with kpop  yes the music is really good  but they also take extra care with the performance factor too so usually the joy in it is consuming everything ,0,190,36

yes  i can still remember no doubt pretty vividly and since i still think it s good music  i suppose young girls do indeed possess superior taste  i do forgive the fandom for not knowing no doubt  even from english speaking countries  since most people who remember them firsthand would probably be at least 30  ,0,312,53
bts is actually known for their lyrics  there tends to be a lot of korean wordplay though especially in rap songs so you have to look for good translations  for example  a fandom favorite is [ddaeng]   which includes many many meanings of the word [ ddaeng ]  ,0,260,45

there lyrics are actually one of their biggest strengths  and yes your are correct to assume that genius isn t a good source for there lyrics  these are some of the trusted fandom translators      there are also some video which break down their lyrics like   for bapsae   for satoori rap  there whole discography is available in spotify except for the free songs the release which are on soundcloud and predebut stuff which are kind of everywhere and nowhere  for songs i suggest checking out singularity  stigma  house of cards  serendipity  lie  rain  let me know  fake love  remix   spring day brit rock version  run  butterfly for starters  for lyrics i recommend songs like  bapsae  dope  no more dream  n o   tomorrow  spinebreaker  satoori rap  hiphop lover  intro  the most beautiful moment in life  moving on  whalien 52  ma city  nevermind  young forever  fire  wings  reflection  first love  begin  awake  mama  am i wrong  spring day  you never walk alone  paradise  134340  anpanman  the truth untold  trivia love  answer love myself  please don t use genius for translations     ,0,1094,174

no  quite the contrary  he s considered very beautiful and attractive   now  at debut  though  i think he was more supposed to play the role of a  muscley tough guy   which doesn t really suit him naturally  his body tone was a lot different at debut  i think he is happier and more natural looking now that he can be more himself ,0,331,58

just go through each album starting with the most recent  the albums are themed  and make sure that you use lyric videos or read translations if you don t know korean  i like the suga and spice channel for album overviews and general intros to bts  though it is less active now  [general intro to bts s music]   includes part of love yourself era   my favorite bts albums in order  1  hyyh  the most beautiful moment in life  young forever  this is compilation album of the era that launched bts into stardom  has a lot of classic bts songs like dope  fire  baepsae  save me  butterfly  etc  theme is the transience of youth and the struggles of entering adulthood  the only song that i really wanted in this compilation that s missing is  nevermind  but you can listen to that separately  2  love yourself  answer  the compilation of their most recent era  following the arc of love gained and lost  followed by the journey to slowly learn to love the self  3  wings  about the loss of innocence and temptation  based on demian and the bangtan universe stories  this was also the album that grew their international popularity  especially the title track mv blood sweat tears  i personally enjoyed wings more visually than musically  but i do think that blood sweat tears was their best comeback to date  the expansion also included  spring day  which is one of their most popular songs  [solo mixtapes albums]   rm   rm raps over different beats to discuss him coming to terms with both his rapper and idol sides agust d  suga tells his life story  confesses his experiences with depression and fame hope world   jhope offers us bop after bop while telling us about his thoughts on his life and how far he s come mono   rm s most recent album  basically therapy in music form ,0,1778,307

 the following are the best translations you can find  they not only translate but also provide cultural and linguistic references to the lyrics because bts esp the rappers use a lot of wordplay and cultural and social references unique to their experiences       ,0,264,42
blonde jimin is my fave,0,23,5
i m on mobile right now and for some reason it s not letting me post links  so bear with me here   often does in depth translations and has entire posts to explain a concept    not exactly translations  but this channel will give background information about some of their songs  bts tends to get very political a lot  and some may get lost in translation   are also accurate     again  other accurate lyrics i m also aware of papercrowns on twitter posting correct lyrics the problem with bts is  they will oftentimes purposely give a lyric multiple meanings  which can make it difficult for any translator to know which would be the best one to use  also  they work in eras  which is different from most western artists  they ll release a set of albums around a particular topic or theme  or even a narrative story  as was the case with the most recent one  one song may not seem like much  but when put in context with the remainder of its era  gives it a lot more meaning  i d also recommend the rock versions of fake love and dna  since you specified you like rock  along with the unplugged version of young forever  ,0,1122,200

i would say start with their lead singles  i need you and fake love have emo vibes and fake love especially has emo lyrics  i would also recommend sea  it s no stairway to heaven but it does discuss disillusion with their reaching the top  i would also suggest spring day  i know you said you re not interested in the video but i would suggest watching it with the song just for the lyrics because half the beauty of the song is it s lyrics  bts can be quite poetic   an oldie which is a personal favourite of mine is tomorrow i love avicci too  and i don t find bts really similar in any way  however  i would recommend save me as it s got some dance vibes and blood sweat and tears just because almost everyone i recommend that song to loves it,0,746,141
i hadn t noticed the release dates were different between the dvd and blu ray when i pre ordered and was so sad when i found that out later   that might have pushed me to give in to the urge to preorder both  but i just went for the blu ray only since i was more concerned about the video quality than the extra goodies  ,0,321,62
these are good sites for translations      i would not recommend genius  the translations there are not always accurate ,0,120,18
no  i don t think you were rude at all  just saying i think it s kinda odd to come onto a bts fan specifc place to ask  if bts is worth listening to  because as a fan of course i  and possibly others  will say i think they re worth listening to cause i love their music haha  but i saw you list the genres you like listening to and i see you like lyrics and there s def many songs that you could enjoy in terms of lyrics  but for me  a good starting point imo is their dark  amp  wild album because it s a good mix of hard hitting and slow songs and some good lyrical content as well  like intro  what am i to you is a pretty hard hitting song by their leader rm  can you turn your cellphone off while a bit more pop ish has a great message about technology and friendships  rain is a bit more  bluesy  and has a melancholy lonely feel to it  there s some lyric videos on yt you can look up to see the translations of specific songs  but you may find some more in depth sources regarding their songs as well online ,0,1015,199

yeah i agree the lyrics translation i have found doesn t seems to confirm the genius i have been informed they are ,0,115,21
i love this  the way they think and speak just squeeze my heart and make me feel so warm with emotion  i particularly liked what joonie said about being 1 of the 7 members and doing his role to  fulfill the share of one member   it takes all seven of them to be bts  and each member contributes their own part to everything they do  no competing with each other or overstepping any bounds  i always love that line from one of the award shows  i think it went  what a relief that we are seven  what a relief that we are together   might have gotten it mixed up but don t mind me i m just sobbing in the corner  ,0,610,120
definitely listen to spring day  the truth untold  epiphany  stigma  singularity  seesaw  serendipity  blood sweat and tears  house of cards  those are my fave  at least  and the lyrics are awesome  look for translations  ,0,222,34

 gt i am not a video and performance guy and definitely not sympathetic to their past and such ok  but this is half of the bts experience  they re musicians primarily but it s a holistic package with aesthetic and performance and ideology all rolled up in it  you can gate all that off if you like  but it s like saying  someone recommend a pizza to a guy who s never tried one  but be warned i absolutely hate crust  dough  and tomatoes   load up the this is bts playlist on spotify and just start listening  if you like it  great  their music is diverse and extremely well produced  you can t make any mistakes just by listening ,0,631,113

personally i think asking us if they re worth listening to isn t really a good way to get an objective pov  i d say listen to them yourself instead of asking their followers who will obviously say they are worth listening to  but if you want to be directed to specific songs  it s best to list genres you listen to and maybe we can point you to songs you may like ,0,364,69
rock  blues  bluegrass but most things i prefer is lyrics  ,0,59,10
you re asking if they re worth listening to on a board of some of their most devoted followers and fans  their music isn t limited to a specific genre  so it might help people if you named artists you already like to listen to  ,0,228,42

so i m not an expert in this  but i read [this chapter]   once and the way it defines parasocial interaction requires  a sense of copresence and mutual awareness  campos castillo  amp  hitlin  2013   in a parasocial interaction  users intuitively feel personally addressed by the other  although they are not  because the other addresses a mass audience   and they experience the seemingly social encounter as reciprocal  although it is not  because it is one sided or non interactive    i don t know if this is the generally accepted definition though  however  the author also points out a phenomenon labeled  parasocial processing  which doesn t require a give and take  such that  parasocial processing captures all  social  responses of users that set in as soon as they perceive a mediated other  even if they just observe the other but do not feel observed by the other   so maybe things like empathetic responses to news stories would fall under that category  and this all certainly seems related to empathy  research seems to show that people with high empathy seem to form tend to develop stronger parasocial relationships than people with lower empathy ,0,1165,182

i remember i watched one of those teens react to kpop videos  i m not sure if bts were in the vid i watched  and i didn t look into it further than that  then in 2017 i decided to use my dormant twitter account to see what happens on twitter and i saw a hashtag trending about bts and the ama s  so i was curious as to who they were and decided to search them on youtube  i just assumed if a non english speaking boyband is performing there must be something more to them than just their looks  i was curious as to what it was  i got hooked on their music lyrics and performance but what i really remember appreciating is their maturity when it came to their craft  also with all the performances i watched i was impressed that there wasn t one obvious  it boy   they seemed very balanced and i couldn t see a weak link  also at the time a lot of the interviews that came up were done in america and i wanted to find interviews were they were a little more comfortable which led to me looking for more content   i kinda also just wanted to know their names   oops  interestingly enough before i knew about them i had been wondering when an artist from asia  that doesn t perform in english  would become i guess  mainstream  or be taken seriously in the us and twitter was like  do you know bts    i didn t have any preconceived notions on k pop and i liked that their lyrics were more than the typical boyband just talking about a girl  which while i don t really mind those songs either it was nice to see variety in the topics they write and perform about  it s kinda easy to appreciate them if you look at them without prejudice  even if you don t end up becoming an army   amp  x200b ,0,1689,312

at first i only knew dna i don t remember why  it was my guilty pleasure but only because of the choreography because i tought it was freaking cool even if the music wasn t my style  i remember that one of my friends was listening to music with her sister  and her sister played fake love and my friend told her to change the song  i asked what song it was and she said  that korean boys  and i said  oh i know them but i don t really like them  i m not interested  months later the idol video with nicki minaj came out and oof i swear if it wasn t for nicki i wouldn t have clicked the video  i remember namjoon was the first who caught my attention and at first i only wanted to learn their names and to differentiate them but i ended up watching all their mvs  watching meme videos and by the first week i was already a hardcore fan  specially when i came across spring day  that song made me fall in love with then  but i was intrigued by their personalities also  it s funny because i totally refused to listen to them before  but their music is really powerfull  they are the only k pop band i m interested in  ,0,1117,212
my friend was showing me music videos and clips of this korean group  and as i make him put up with nonsense i like all the time too i was a good sport and watched the videos  i wasn t a big fan of the music  though i was impressed with the production  and i liked how goofy and cute the members all were interacting with each other in clips and videos  my friend gets all pumped because they might win a billboard  and i keep tabs on twitter while it s happening because i sort of like them and even if i don t vibe their music really  i can tell they work hard and it s a big deal to them to get recognized  i even find the short speech by the one guy who speaks english to be endearing  anyway then my friend links me mic drop remix when it comes out and i am absolutely addicted to the beat and the whole thing  it s like a visual treat  and wheni figure out how to turn on lyrics i m tickled by the bragging song of these dudes who just won an award  i listen to this one song on repeat long enough that i decide to buy it  except oops  the version i got on itunes doesn t have the killer intro on korean that i liked so much  but there s another version that does on some weird album that s pretty cheap  so i just grab the whole album  i didn t actually like it a ton at first aside from mic drop  but the music grew on me  and my friend kept showing me more songs i d like  a month later i bought wings bc i had been hooked on a few more songs  i showed my sister the bst mv because i was just amazed  and she asked me if these were my boys  and did i stan  i had no idea what she meant  it was a slow descent into insanity and by the time i realized i was in too deep my friend who hooked me had sent me a koya cushion from the line store opening day  i honestly didn t want to accept that i d gone full fangirl at first  i told myself i was too old for this sort of thing  but the more i listened and watched and read lyrics the more connected i felt  and i found myself rooting for them whenever i d hear they broke some new record  i slipped all the way down the slope from  oh i just like this 1 song  to learning fan chants for a concert i m traveling to alone and planning a tattoo like please send help i still don t know how this happened ,0,2256,456

as other comments have already said  connections and influence matter more then just bulk profit  even pledis has more sales then yg  bighit having more profit doesn t say much  and if the ongoing scandal has revealed anything it has definitely revealed that yg has a shit ton of influence to the point of even speculations are made if yg is actually connected to the older administration of south korea  bighit just doesn t have that influence and connections just yet  bts only started registering on the korean media s mind just last year  it takes time to build connection and influence  so bighit could be part of the big 3 in the future but i don t consider it a part just at this moment  i am also not that into the big 3 title anyway given how many bad scandals they have been involved in whether it s artist abuse or other stuff ,0,838,150

i just wanted to know who jungkook  jimin and rm was because of the waste it on me track  i m a big indie music fan so i thought it was from an indie group  i came across the mask singer episode with jungkook and my i was curious  then i heard v s voice  then i watched bst because of it s link to demian  i was excited   a boy band referencing a book    boy before i knew it  i was watching theory vids and mvs  haha  then i moved on to crackvids and vlives  xd ,0,463,95
i knew it existed  but had very hazy details on what kpop was or who was in it  to be honest  i tried and wanted to get into kpop in 10th grade when a friend showed me many videos of her favourite group  but after a few days i lost interest and began watching anime instead lol  at that time i was super into music in other languages so it would ve been  so easy  to make me a fan but seriously nothing caught my eye  i discovered bts on my own a while later  said it here before but the lyrics of dope amazed me  i imagined a whole story of working professionals escaping during their break to show their pride  then i got hooked on the hyyh universe and theories  and by the time the wings short films came out  i was as deep into theories as you can get    a month later  i thought it was natural to get into other groups  so i started watching videos of two other groups  for one of them i liked their personalities  but their music honestly sucked  and for the other one i found their videos a little boring  now it s been 3 years and bts is still the only group i follow  so i m not sure i accept the label of a kpop fan  ,0,1128,225
bighit has been  1 in net profit the last two years  they almost make double what yg makes in 2018 they even have less operating costs  they re also valued between 1 2 trillion  jyp was valued at 1 trillion  for right now they definitely are a big 3 ,0,250,47

based on how bighit operating  txt is poised to be atleast becoming mid tier or top 3 4 in future  which mean it still gonna help bighit getting a lot of money  and the fact that they only have 2 groups and 1 artist  bighit dont have much to spend that affecting alot their net profit  from bts  i can see that bighit gonna applying similar marketing and promo on how getting money even without promoting alot on tv and active on solo work  like obviously they gonna produce tons of merchandise related to txt as well while trying to produce high quality music for txt to make sure their fandom stay loyal and growing  if bighit partnership with cj in producing so called global group next year become successful  bighit could stay on their own and people may no more questioning their position as big3 big4  however  for me  i dont prefer for bighit applying for ipo  i am bit nervous thinking bighit may gonna lose their creative control on their artists  so  i just love how they are right now  i actually dont mind for them not to be in big3  they have done so well as private company until now  ,0,1100,200

i have heard of their name and my friends are actually pretty into them  but i only listened to dna before and could never understand the hype and i just blindly dismissed them as  overrated    i don t get why these guys are famous  etc  until some time last year i was suggested i need u from a music app  the artist was        bangtan sonyeondan in chinese  i had no idea it was bts s full name   i loved the song from first listening to it  the first two verses by suga and j hope already hooked me  which is rare because i don t even like listening to rap  but this is different  it s like    rapping out a melody  i don t know xd  fast forward a few months  i started listening to their songs on a spotify playlist  i came across boy in luv  i loved fake love and mic drop as well but at that point they were just catchy songs for me  then i came across dope and the music video   when jin s part came on  my heart totally melted   insert j hope s  oh my heartue is     my heartue is    oh my god   did it make sense to pick a bias before i even stanned the group  xd i was just like  what is his name     excuse my fangirl moment  i also remember replaying dope many many many many times because it s just so damn catchy  what really got me into bts as a group for good was when i started watching those fanmade crack videos  i didn t even know their names but they sure are funny  then i started watching a couple of bts run clips  the point is  i didn t feel like i was just watching them doing what they were doing  it s like i m there with them getting to know them during the process  every one of their personalities is real  distinct and raw  i was pleasantly surprised that they also don t have the  we are superstars  kind of vibe at all  they are humble  well spoken and on some level very relatable  i always felt that the more relatable someone is  the more inspiring they can be  and bts really inspired me on many levels till this day  anyways  i m just glad i got to know these boys  i know there are plenty of other artists who are also talented  hardworking and special but after knowing bts  they really do deserve the level of success they have achieved  hey bts  you nice  keep going  ,0,2211,415

i knew about kpop when i was in high school but never got into it  fast forward to late november 2017  i stumbled across a clip of mic drop remix mv on facebook  i was shocked that it just sounded like hype hip hop and really liked all the choreo and swag  i became obsessed with everything mic drop for a month  i then started descending into the rabbit hole at first cautiously and then falling deep at an alarmingly fast rate  after watching mvs  interviews  intro vids  ahl  listening to all their discography  learning their all their names etc and barely sleeping for about 2 weeks because of bts  i finally declared myself army in january 2018  i m still here because i love their music  it s rare for me to like entire discography of any artist  and they just seem like really great people  i wanna continue being by their side with this awesome fan community and keep following bts  journey ,0,900,162

i m kinda skeptical about this one  it s not like this is now official that there is now the big 4  or that is ever was  and this was tweeted from a translation account that is obviously an army and would pick and choose from whatever article that benefits army  i love bts  i love many other kpop groups including yg groups and groups associated with cj amp m  in fact i only discovered about them because i bought an i made cd from  g  i dle and it was charged to them and i had to know who the hell i was paying so i discovered them and found them to control a ton of shit  i just want to say  don t be toxic and shove this in yg stans  faces and don t treat this like it s official either because the sharing of this is clearly biased  i m also kinda skeptical because of reasons other users on the internet have pointed out  bighit doesn t have that many artists in the first place compared to the well established artists in the  big 3  but it doesn t mean the world that they don t have a ton of people if those select few are making so much money  anyway yeah  just my thoughts  don t go around treating this like it is official word ,0,1142,217

i felt the same with spring day  this song is very special in that  i was able to feel comfort in two different situations  when i was happy and found a new connection emotionally  and when i was at the point of a heartbreak  again  emotional  and lost that same connection  it s powerful if you think about it  ,0,312,58

cj is a media conglomerate that has bought out several small labels and has been getting into idol business because of it  but central management doesn t care much about it  except for the money it brings  and leaves everything to the agencies  which means their condition is akin to artists in small agencies  not the  formerly  big3  off the record  agency of fromis_9 and iz one  doesn t even have their own training facilities  they use pledis    and mmo lm have been treating their golden boy kang daniel like dirt  which hopefully is going to come back at them   showing ts level of greed and disrespect  if not worse   ,0,626,106

jin went on the law of the jungle in late 2016 and it aired in jan 2017  i remember jin tried this because he just really wanted to and not exactly for any promo purpose  he even went to shoot for this on his own vacation time from bts  and yes i agree  i think bighit is trying to built those connection but still hasn t built those connection just yet  their connection network is not as extensive as other big 3 company  though i guess they do have connection with cj and dispatch at the very least  ,0,503,97
well there s a good point  i just assumed he said something like  what   i didn t hear you  but there s no reason to think he didn t hear and or have something else to say  he s very observant about others  ex  jimin s reaction to the arboretum  so he may have figured jk also had some weighty things leading to anxiously chewed fingernails     and he certainly has a lot of his own life crap on his mind  everyone who said they had no dreams ended up shouting out to the universe     including yoongi  it will be interesting to hear the lyrics of his song too  ,0,562,103

well  profit wise bighit is definitely comparable to any of the big 3  but having a bigger roster does give a bit more stability which the other company s do have  like in sm s case  even without exo  due to the coming enlistment  and shinee they still have groups like suju  tvxq bringing in huge amount of cash from their tour and sales  and this is why yg was suffering a bit last year  he just doesn t have any group that is big enough to compensate for big bang  blackpink are pretty big  they have the largest following among the new yg group and their sales prove it  they also have public interest like any other yg group and have great digitals but they are still not big bang big  maybe in the future blackpink will become that big  it s definitely possible given their hype and popularity  but not now  i think bighit will have a similar problem when bts will start enlisting  txt are pretty big as rookies but they are not bts big  so i don t think txt can completely support bighit while bts is gone  though of course this is based on limited knowledge because we still haven t seen txt comeback and how much they have grown since their debut  so i guess a lot of variable are involved and it s too soon to make a definite decision ,0,1245,230

i think they can start to branch out into those things now that they have the revenue    but only if they  want  to  i feel like bighit is breaking new boundary and proving that it s ok to just focus on the music  and not have to branch out into acting modeling ect  and i think that s ballsy as all hell and i hope they can keep that up lol ,0,342,66
 but i don t really like them that much     that was me  too  my sister  who was into kpop  asked if it was bts when i listened to save me  my answer was a defensive   yes  but i m not into them  i only like this song   and here i am ,0,234,50
i thought  big 3  status had as much to do with the connections those agencies had within other korean media organisations  broadcast networks  brands etc that allowed them to keep a stranglehold on certain jobs  opportunities and guaranteed media coverage  as it did the recognition of their groups by the korean gp  bangtan kinda bypassed a lot of the accepted strategy for getting known  no acting jobs for members in 3 years now  not much appearing on non run bv variety shows  no solo non musical activity for anyone since 2017 i think  when did jin go on that jungle show   so i don t know if bighit has built those connections with the regular media so far  i mean  i believe they have some kind of arrangement with dispatch but that seems to be it so far ,0,763,134

hear me out  this one is going to sound a little strange  i want jungkook to sing  and possibly rap because i enjoyed rapper jk  on a collaboration with japanese rock band one ok rock  one ok rock originally had a lot of rap with their songs but they moved away from that sound when their gutarist rapper left the band  jk cited oor s  we are  as one of the songs that he enjoyed previously  alternatively i want just a jk x taka of oor duet  this would never happen  but i want a jin x yoshiki rock ballad collab  i think jin can do some serious rock ballads  and no one writes an orchestral rock ballad like yoshiki hayashi  on the western collab front  i want an rap line x mike shinoda collab  here s why   i see this as a western rap collab that would actually have both english and korean rap  rather than the automatically expecting rm to rap in english thing that has been going on in change and champion   i think mike shinoda would be totally cool with them rapping in korean  so mike can rap in english  rap line can rap in mostly korean  with the hook in english   and it would play in all da clubs  since i m just missing jm and v at this point  i want a duet from just the two of them  i loved their harmony in the last part of fake love  and want more of it  ,0,1274,241
i am a bit uncomfortable about cj s continues rise and take over  some people tend to forget that cj is bigger then all of big 3 put together  they are a conglomerate  one of the 5 largest company of whole south korea and seem to be constantly buying other entertainment company which makes me worry if they are trying for a monopoly of the kpop world  even sm s beef with cj and mnet is because they tried to interfere with sm s music distribution and mess with it  i am always been a bit uncomfortable about cj and bighit s collab but i realised that bighit just isn t big enough to actually oppose cj so maybe they kind of entered a compromise to preserve itself if cj is actually aiming for that monopoly  it s also why i don t want bighit to do a ipo soon because cj is definitely going to buy a shit ton of their stocks ,0,826,156

yeah i noticed the fabric print for the yoongi doll s suit was cut to align as correctly as possible   that s tough to do even on human sized clothes  and often not done at all on cheaper clothes   i m not a fan of the dolls but some effort did go into this on mattel s part fwiw ,0,280,54
one thing that i often hear when discussing big hit becoming a part of  the big 4  is cultural impact and a big roster  despite the finances  they lack variety in their talents  jyp  sm and yg all have a huge roster actors  models  different idols etc  big hit only has txt  bts and lee hyun and has yet to prove that they can be a proper major label spanning over multiple talents and therefore doesn t qualify to be a part of  the big 4   thoughts ,0,450,86
aww  hyyh really goes a long way  and i feel you  bts are probably always so ecstatic when they see covers of them  i remember when they reacted on the ark and their reactions were so nice ,0,189,37

thank you for sharing your thoughts  first of all  no  none of this is  weird  behaviour  after all  the idea of weirdness is just some concept others have formulated to label people who choose not to fit their mold  they use weirdness like a weapon  but you  you have strength  just the act of reaching out and sharing these thoughts with us is already strength in its purest form  i went through the same pains you re going through right now  believe it or not  instead of bts  i fantasized  dreamt and hoped for friends in the form of characters from an old pc game  grand chase  i had no real friends as a child  my father tried his best to make my living conditions better  but he couldn t fix the daily barrage of insults and bullying that went my way  i was different  i was an outcast among my society  i think differently  with abstract thoughts that dived deep into the complex and the philosophical  but i couldn t share them with others my age or older with the fear of being labeled as  weird   no one could understand my words  no matter how much i screamed for them  whenever i wept  the teachers would distance other children from me because i was  an attention seeker   beyond my dad  i felt no love from the world  one day  i began imagining  what would it be like if the chase were my friends   day by day  a new member would enter my conscious thought and keep me company  lire  an eleven archer  became my moral guide and conscience  jin  a fighter from the silver knights  was my motivator to keep living another day  ronan  a magic wielding knight  was the one whom i could express my deep philosophical observations with and we would bounce off our ideas to each other during my sleepless nights alone  there were many more chasers  each member provided me another lifeline and another friend  sounds silly  i know  buy it was because of these friends i had  i was able to overcome my extreme loneliness and lack of love and empathy from others  the chase became my safe haven as a child  with their help  i began to use reason over my impulsive emotions  caused by years of trauma  i grew out of my shell and developed more confidence because of whatever support they gave me  i began to have friends   real friends   again  and while my situation in life was still shittier than the gutters  i wasn t alone anymore  i had both the friends inside of me  and the friends around me to help pick me up  i managed to stay strong and last long enough until i was given a fresh shot at reinventing myself in a new country  canada  there  i took the lessons i learned from my past life and from the chasers and began to really  truly find myself in a new land  it s been almost a decade since the chasers have greeted me to say hello  since those times  i have finished high school with flying colours  gained many new friends for life  but most importantly  found the answer to who i am and what my purpose in life is  i haven t found all the solutions  but i learned to love myself  at a time when no one else loved me  through the help of my old friends  bts will help you fight your day to day battles  they will guide you  comfort you  and help you grow  but i urge you to reach your hand out even more  try your best to get in touch with someone who you can trust and talk to  even i had to utilize a counsellor  which helped me a lot growing up  you have the strength  the power and ability to change your circumstance for the better  find your allies  those who will love you unconditionally and whom you can love unconditionally back  don t stay silent  speak out  oppressors find those who stay quiet as weak prey  take action and fight back  you re not alone  if you have bullies  find your friends  if you don t have friends  rely on your family  if your family doesn t have your back  reach out because there  are  and  will be  people who will  you have bts  you have us now  here at  as well  don t be afraid to talk to me or any one of us here if you have a problem  we re here for you  you matter  you have potential  no matter what anyone else says  we love you  you never walk alone ,0,4120,760

i heard about bts since 2014 but didn t bother to check them out  but the funny thing  while scrolling my twitter tl  there was a tweet discussing about inu or prologue theories  the tweet talked about how each one them was suffering and jin or v committed su cide smth like that  i don t quite remember  but the thing is  i felt so sad reading that tweet w o even knowing the background story  hahaha  i started to dig their music when there was a trainee group in reality show covering dope  i was so impressed with the lyrics esp  then  a new army was born  that s why when some ppl on twitter being arrogant and dismissed trainees esp from big3  covering bts songs  claiming they wanted clout  i felt so offended because u never know how many new fans will discover bts thru that way  plus  i m sure the boys are thrilled to see their songs being covered left  amp  right ,0,876,159

i ve been a metal head for forever and i watch youtube like its tv   bts content had been scrolled past from channels i sub to like music video sins and fine bros because i wasnt  into  that sort of music  but at work we have to listen to generic radio 1 and they gave idol airplay  i added it to my  catchy pop  playlist of stuff i like from this station but i never bothered looking up any other songs  then when i saw their interview with graham norton trending i watched it and was sucked in by hobi   his  you re my hope  lines and smile just wrecked me  it was completley him that made me watch the mvs and youtube content  but by the next weekend it was the music  i ve not felt this way about music before and it s helped me through tough times the past 6 months  it was my own fault it took me so long to discover them but i found them at the point i needed them most  as the saying goes ,0,897,180

thank you for sharing  so random question  i tend to get emotional when reading about certain news stories and such  for instance  a few years ago i saw a picture of a sobbing boy carrying a dead relative after a devastating earthquake and i cried immediately  would this be an example of a parasocial interaction  also  when people feel anger toward the president or a different public figure  would that constitute as a parasocial relationship  i m trying to understand the lines between random empathy  regular opinion  and social interaction with public figures from parasocial interactions and relationships  ,0,614,97

i know in hong kong at mama the stage was ridiculously tall  i think almost a foot taller than me  and i m  5 5   to the point where you couldn t see the main stage from the back of the extended stage from the pit   but i also heard from people there that hk stages are usually really high  also still managed to get pretty decent fancams and just seeing their faces anyway  since the angle isn t that steep lol  and since it s the walkway  thin     i think you ll definitely see them fine unless you re right at the very edge of the main stage  which might be a little harder  as far as i noticed at the bts ly concert in taiwan  the stage was actually only i think a bit taller than most peoples  height   apart from the main stage being higher  though  however  bts does have the large panels on the side all the time  so you ll be able to see what s going on whether the stage is crazy y all or not  i don t think it will be considering the heights of bts s previous concerts and it being in america  so you ll probably be okay  plus the seats are originally  seated  so one would assume you should still have a decent view even seated  no guarantees  though   ,0,1165,220

\  their music is simultaneously super pleasing to listen to  comforting and relatable  and a lot of good lyrics and messages  when i was first listening to them i wasn t super impressed  but when i listened to songs like baepsae  pied piper and paradise i was surprised at a  how fun the songs were and b  how deep the lyrics were  as cliche as that is   \  what they represent  it wasn t supposed to be them to get this big  it was supposed to be a bigger  prettier  better group from a big company with more resources  they resonate with a lot of people  it s not supposed to be   a journey many can relate to  \  entertaining and likeable personalities  also openness and vulnerability in what they ve said and their music  \  superficial but also important  great performers  bighit also does a good job coming up with and executing concepts with complex story lines  aesthetics  themes  etc  it all comes together in a cool way  in general they re very good connectors   from their music  their personalities  their dynamic  their lyrics  their words  they can connect  and to many they offer hope  encouragement  and something to relate to   amp  x200b  hope this helps  ,0,1178,202

i kind of feel like they just wouldn t act on it unless they fell deeply in love with someone in their circles  in the context of t o p from bigbang being caught smoking weed  it was his friend s drug use that busted him  that appalls me  to be surveilled to that extent  i feel so sorry for what happened to t o p  myself and most of my friends are queer  and in our mid twenties one of my best friends who is very flamboyant and typically queer in appearance but always maintained he was straight  to the point of faking a crush on me  sat me down and told me  his voice full of shame   i ve been lying to you for years  i m actually gay   i told him it was obviously totally cool and i didn t see it as lying and that it changed nothing about our friendship  i come from a traditional asian background and only came out to my family in my early thirties  and my friends and i exist in a liberal  metropolitan western city and are part of a large radical queer community and were still closeted for years  under the kind of pressure and scrutiny that bts are under  i think the tight circle of trust amongst the 7 of them  i think it really helps that they re able to share this insane experience of fame together  must be really helpful and meaningful  but god  the scrutiny  always having to have good skin and be gorgeous and smiley  having to look good at the airport in front of hundreds of screaming people  when everyone feels like shit after a sleep deprived 18 hour flight   even when traveling first class  i hope as they get older and become further solidified as a grade celebs  that this along with cultural changes will buy them a bit of leeway in terms of the public  forgiving  them for supposed transgressions such as having a private life  ,0,1760,326

short version  youtube suggested some mvs and the typical  i just wanna know their names  long version  i have always had varied interests  it shocks me how narrow minded some people are  especially when i moved to the us and everyone was judging my european music   watched anime as a teenager and got into kdramas over my college years but nothing too crazy  however always had a curiosity about other cultures and i know a surprising amount on asian countries  can t remember which mv i watched first but i remember being hooked by the time i watched fire because of 3 33    only experience i had with kpop prior to that was exo  i even remember seeing the overdose mv on a german tv channel when it came out  but i barely noticed it was in korean i just downloaded the song and continued with my life  crazy to think i could ve gone down the kpop road back then lol officially became army in 2019 i would say  almost caught up with content  it s been a blast  ,0,964,177
at this point  i m pretty much convinced that if you show bst to anyone  they ll be in for the ride and will start stanning bts lol,0,131,26
yeah no it was great  i never was into kpop prior or any boy bands either so it definitely surprised me that i was starting to like them  ,0,138,27
same for me  i hope that kind of tradition goes a long way hehe,0,63,14
ahhh the bst mv of course  i think a lot of newer fans got hooked by it and at this point i m not even surprised  and they were really cute in fallon  i hope they visit there again soon ,0,186,39
i think you re so right about the format and length being right  not overwhelming as it could have been      and they ve also made good choices for the webtoon  the bloody content and the repetition  in the latter  needs to go somewhere but it would never have worked in a video or in a book  the writing team have made excellent choices  i agree again that a bit more humour would be helpful  in general  its a bts strength so it would be a nice relief to have more  the idea of them all going off to battle their own demons  and learn their own personal lessons  is a good one  and it could give us more solos  somewhere down the line      as long as  yes  please dear god  may they also learn to communicate with and help one another     if you think about it  each is on their own  individual quest of self discovery and maturing hopefully towards health and happiness  but they re also a group unit and potential team who could do much better together than alone  i like that there are very symbolism heavy videos and the webtoon that are more fantastical than the more realistic videos and the notes book  and i love how dividing things up like this could give them a licence to get even more fantastic and magic if they want to  they have all kinds of demons and a fairly wild array of archetypes to explore so why not get more comic webtoon y in some timelines  i made a joke about their becoming ninja time travelers on another thread but i was  shhh  only half joking  [the not today mv starts with a fiery psychedelic  wormhole  continues with them fighting for dreamers and ends with them linking arms before we see the wormhole  again at the end    ] and jung s hero and jester  magician  old wise man     there are so many     could be great masks and directions to go  anyway  you re much better at reading symbolism than i am but you just convinced my to look harder now i m on a second reading  the whole old man and bully episode was just strange to me and even the tae jk pairing  and now were concentrating more on jung  cue a renewed search for shadow and anima  omg so many depths ,0,2103,389
[ seven boys with one heart  one boy with seven hearts  ]   then remember how seokjin s short film combined imagery from the other six  how in the wings concept leak his pairing with the members read inner   outer  back in hyyh era he was also strongly associated with the figure of psyche  and there was some death and rebirth imagery we generally interpreted to stand for the process of growth  so basically there was a theory that the stories of the seven can be combined  inside out style  to form one narrative of maturation  how  there were different takes  [the bangtan theory]    was probably the most advanced of them all  it hasn t aged well  but it is an army theorist classic  so it may be an interesting read for history s sake  ,0,742,130
waste it on me  that s so new  welcome to the fandom  i m glad you decided to have give bts a chance and listen to their music and watch their performances  also  you mentioning your username made me laugh so hard ,0,214,40
the music video is    idol s mv is so stimulating so i get where you re coming from  and they do  they have so so so much content  i don t even know how the new people in the fandom is keeping up with their old content ,0,219,44
i can totally relate with that earworm bts omg  for me it was taehyung s part in boy in luv when i watched mama 2014  this is so nice that we really got hooked with their music first things first since it s something that they truly love doing ,0,244,47
 gt  my concerns about asian erasure invalidated and equal to jumping on a hate train  i never meant that in this context  i mean that i personally do not want to judge them until i physically see what they look like  rather than judge them based on a press photo reveal  which are from time to time edited   gt  and i ve seen a ton of comments about erasing their asian features i guess we follow different people then  and any people and any people with concerns about the erasure of their features are valid  i would like mattel to maybe come out with a feedback form for fans to voice their concerns about the designs which could maybe persuade them to come out with a second more realistic  but still cost effective  set of dolls that look closer to the boys in person  with better hair and features ofc  ,0,810,149

yep  my daughter was talking about them a lot  i indulged her and talked about them here or there   oh yeah  they re cute   jimin s iconic  excuse meeee  video was really adorable to be fair  but one day she showed me a dance practice and i was done for  i am such a huge sucker for well done choreography  that s the day i fell down the rabbit hole and now i have this love for every single whole ass dork in this group and i want nothing more than them to be excessively happy for the rest of their lives  ,0,508,99
aww  this was so refreshing to read  i know ahl had some their moments of cringe and most of the fans wouldn t recommend it to new fans  but i actually loved that show because the boys were so genuine and so sweet there  i m so glad you got to see that humble side of the boys ,0,277,56
i was never into kpop and thought it was too cutesy and cringey from the thumbnails i had seen  youtube autoplayed bst and i was  shook   i had stopped watching mvs for a while but the production value and concept blew my mind  i listened to it on repeat for days until decided that i wanted to know their names and the rest is history ,0,336,65
yeah  i got into it all around the same time as u   i also had this feeling  but actually i don t think they are really changing it  but more trailblazing a unique way that performance and the presentation of really well rounded music can reach every corner of the globe  not just the radios top 40  they ve become a power  and an influence on really everything from album sales  streaming  social media and global reach  i ve see their global appeal and reach as the most unique aspect of their success  and am enormously proud that the torch was taken by a group from asia   where internet access for mass and diverse populations is expanding ,0,645,116
same  i really don t like kpop  so it s very weird that i am a huge bts fan lol  i really love how they interweave music  message  art  literature  and stories in one  i ve never seen any artist do that and they do it so effectively  not to mention how passionate and genuine they are  ,0,286,54

i saw their jimmy fallon bits since they were trending on youtube and i had this vague recognition of what bts was but never checked them out before  before then  the only kpop videos i ever watched were gangnam style and i am the best  i think the first btsxfallon video i watched was the fortnite challenge one  and seeing how skilled and charming they were led me to watching the idol performance  phew that performance was everything  i didn t really expect them to be good dancers  but they are amazing  and being a dancer myself i have so much respect for  and was so impressed that they executed barrel jumps in their choreo  after that i was cautiously optimistic and watched their videos on youtube  but they didn t really snatch me until i watched the bst mv  after which i was a goner ,0,796,144

i honestly am still in shock at how i became an army  to be frank  i actually do not like kpop  my musical taste isn t suited for the audience it targets  so i actually do not know any kpop groups prior to bts  but what brought my attention to bts was that their song  waste it on me  was playing on the radio while i was driving to work  it literally caught me off guard since i ve always thought kpop was cringey and only had korean lyrics  yes  i know i sound a bit ignorant and i apologize   the song was catchy and the most shocking thing was that their english sounds fluent and would totally pass as being a native english speaker  fast forward to two weeks later  i was bored on youtube and decided to search up bts  i wasn t a huge fan of their discography but over time their songs grew onto me  although i fell in love with save me instantly  after watching a couple of performances in the us  i went into a frenzy and could not stop watching bts  their personality and charisma is what ultimately got me staying  and this is my story of becoming an army    btw  please ignore my username  i only made it for this subreddit and made it up randomly  so please excuse the contradiction in the comment ,0,1210,230

as a fan of korean comics i was always secretly proud of bts  but didn t know anything about them  idol was trending on youtube  so i watched it  i didn t particularly love it  but the music video was kind of addicting  a month later i went back and watched it again  feeling bored i continued watching more of their music videos  i just continued to fall into the rabbit hole  they have so much content ,0,404,75

everybody was talking about the dna mv  so what the hell  let s see  when i saw i thought  it s okay   next day when i woke up early to go to college i was whistling on the streets the jungkook intro  \ humn what s this song in my head  ohhh is bts anyway when i came home i got one album to listen to  you never walk alone  and enjoyed but didn t really crab my attention  the first albuns that made me be interested in them was wake up and skool luv affair  this is hip hop      which i listened only in the next year when i was looking for something new to listen  i was in the songs and decided to learn who they are  so i found out about american hustle life  what really got me was the image of idols in my head was something distant to you with their  perfect images  but bts is really relatable and focused on music so this made me fall in the army hole ,0,862,170
short version  stumbled on bst on youtube  jimin happened  sold  no refunds  no exchanges  long version  a coworker showed me save me  i didn t have any preconceived notions about kpop but definitely had a few about boybands  i thought they were pretty  then i sort of forgot about them  a year later  i was watching these travel vloggers and they were talking about despacito  i am one of those people who reads youtube comments and one of them said the only reason they d even heard of despacito was because of bts  this was confusing to me that they d never heard of this really big thing but knew about it because of bts who i d never heard of  which turned out to be not quite true after i fell down the rabbit hole and saw save me again   so i searched them up  saw bst  loved it  and sort of never looked back  i stay because i ve never wanted to leave ,0,860,160

i was randomly suggested ahl on youtube and got curious as to what it was based on the title   korean stars kidnapped in la   and decided to watch it  the clip was only about 15 mins long  but it left a cliff hanger so i searched up the entire episode  i guess i was intrigued by the concept  celebrities from a foreign country coming to the us to learn about the hip hop music culture    it was just surprising to me to see this sort of thing from celebrities so i ended up watching the entire series  what really got me to search more about them was their personalities and how they expressed it in the show  they were humble  down to earth  goofy  and above all seemed to really want to learn to better themselves  which isn t something you see very often from people in general  let alone celebrities  afterwards  i searched up some more shows from them  then ventured into their music which floored me with its lyrics and quality and down the rabbit hole i went   ,0,969,176
